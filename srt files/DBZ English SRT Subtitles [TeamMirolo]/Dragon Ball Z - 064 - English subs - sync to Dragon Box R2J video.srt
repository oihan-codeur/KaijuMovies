<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,735
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:26,685
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,915 --> 00:01:57,875
<i>Ghurd, of the Ginyu Special Corps,</i>
<i>the evil emperor Freeza's secret weapon,</i>

18

<i>However, at the last critical moment,</i>
<i>Vegeta jumped in and saved them.</i>

19
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:12,855
Do you think I deliberately rescued you?

20
00:03:12,895 --> 00:03:14,285
Don't get me wrong.

21
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:18,665
I just had the perfect chance to kill
that grubby bastard Ghurd, that's all.

22
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:23,875
ReaCoom!

23
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,435
Butta!

24
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:29,675
Jheese!

25
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:35,005
The real hell starts now.

26
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:50,455
<i>"The Savage ReaCoom!!</i>
<i>He's Bad, He's Strong, He's Outrageous."</i>

Okay, Vegeta<i>-chan</i>, now it's our turn.

28
00:04:45,315 --> 00:04:50,215
You two little pipsqueaks
there, give Vegeta<i>-chan</i> a hand.

29
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:54,785
Use as many dirty tricks as you need to.

30
00:04:54,825 --> 00:05:00,965
Hey, ReaCoom! Don't kill the little ones!
<i>We're</i> going to kill them, after all!

31
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,535
Leave a little treat for us, too!

32
00:05:08,845 --> 00:05:10,635
Dammit!

33
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,375
Why, that jerk!

34
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:18,815
Ginyu...

35
00:05:18,855 --> 00:05:22,645
...Special Corps...

36
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:25,785
ReaCoom!!

37
00:05:45,715 --> 00:05:51,815
Hey, what's going on here? Vegeta<i>-chan</i>'s
power level just rose to upwards of 30,000!

38
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:58,415
Get down!

39
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,755
More! More! More!

40
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,985
H-He got him.

41
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:45,795
Incredible... He ended it all in one instant.
Vegeta has ridiculous strength, all right.

42
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:57,375
Hey, it couldn't be, right?

43
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:07,985
A-A <i>ki</i>! H-He's alive! That guy is alive!

44
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:11,515
H-He couldn't be... N-No way...

45
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,155
Hi!

46
00:08:23,205 --> 00:08:29,145
H-He's taken hardly any damage at all!

47
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:34,135
That's enough for the warm-up exercises.

48
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:42,185
ReaCoom is trying to look cool,
and we're getting all dusty over here!

49
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:45,555
Our cleaning bill is going to be outrageous.

50
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,525
W-What kind of monster is he?

51
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:57,365
How is it that we have to get the
Dragon Balls back from someone like this?

52
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,065
Whoops!

53
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:13,145
That was close, that was close.
I almost screwed up.

54
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,715
I have to make sure to
deliver these to Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

55
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,735
Planet Namek.

56
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:35,165
Environment: moderate; culture level: low;

57
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:37,175
practical resources: none;

58
00:09:37,215 --> 00:09:43,155
scouting industrial space,
commercial space, and residential space.

59
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:50,215
Such a worthless planet, huh?
Perhaps I will make it a planet for exiles.

60
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:53,925
There are any number of
planets like this one in the universe.

61
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:57,955
I doubt there would be any value in
going to the trouble of developing it.

62
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:07,565
I will be acquiring the Dragon Balls shortly,
so I will have no further business here.

63
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:12,935
I know. As we are leaving,
I will turn this planet into fireworks.

64
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:14,105
F-Fireworks?

65
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:18,945
Yes. To celebrate my eternal life.

66
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:21,975
A big, flashy "boom."

67
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:27,555
Are there any other planets we can
sell for development at a high price?

68
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:30,795
Y-Yes, sir, I will investigate at once.

69
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:41,595
<i>Dragon Balls... how delightful...</i>

70
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,815
Well, should we get started?

71
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:59,395
<i>ReaCoom Kick!!</i>

72
00:11:04,135 --> 00:11:06,155
V-Vegeta<i>-san</i>!

73
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:35,155
Good! That's pretty good, Vegeta<i>-chan</i>!
You're better than I thought, huh?

74
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,595
<i>ReaCoom Elbow!!</i>

75
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:58,145
He got him!

76
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,345
<i>Speed Up!!</i>

77
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:03,115
Yoo-hoo!

78
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:27,005
Way to go, ReaCoom!

79
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:29,145
Whoo! Whoo!

80
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:34,555
Thanks, guys!

81
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,455
V-Vegeta<i>-san...</i>

82
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:31,635
What's the matter, Vegeta<i>-chan</i>?

83
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:36,015
You can't possibly be
finished after that, right?

84
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:21,225
You're still pretty spirited, huh? Good for you!

85
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:42,205
Hey, now, are you okay?

86
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:48,025
Don't tell me you've kicked
the bucket already, have you?

87
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,545
D-Did he get him?

88
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:30,755
Okay...

89
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:40,605
Nice, nice, that's more like it.

90
00:15:40,645 --> 00:15:46,235
There's the reason why Freeza<i>-sama</i>
adored you so much, long ago, huh?

91
00:15:46,275 --> 00:15:50,415
But why would you turn
your back on him, Vegeta<i>-chan</i>?

92
00:15:53,155 --> 00:15:56,145
ReaCoom is the same as ever, huh?

93
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,485
He's got a nasty personality.

94
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,925
What a freak!

95
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:09,295
Don't you have any techniques
with more panache than that?

96
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,735
If not, then it's about
time I killed you. Is that okay?

97
00:16:13,775 --> 00:16:21,575
<i>Y-You monster! Damn it...</i>
<i>To think he'd be this strong...</i>

98
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:26,315
<i>It's almost as though he's</i>
<i>treating me like a toddler...</i>

99
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:34,185
<i>If it keeps going like this,</i>
<i>I'm going to get killed by him...</i>

100
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:37,455
G-Gohan...

101
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:38,595
Yes?

102
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:43,595
I-If Vegeta gets done in, then it
will be our turn to get killed next.

103
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:47,005
M-Make no mistake,
there's no way we can beat him.

104
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:50,105
I'm sure that not even Goku could.

105
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:55,805
At this point, it's all or
nothing. Let's charge him!

106
00:16:55,845 --> 00:16:57,145
Right!

107
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,885
All righty...

108
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:08,155
Your life is mine!

109
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:12,355
There it is! ReaCoom's 18th final pose.

110
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:19,365
Poor Vegeta<i>-chan.</i> The life
of a flower is so short, huh?

111
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,925
Okay, I'll finish you with this.

112
00:17:44,035 --> 00:17:47,595
All right... let's go, Gohan!

113
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:53,935
Vegeta doesn't have the strength
left to avoid ReaCoom's quick attacks.

114
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:55,365
Right!

115
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:57,375
<i>ReaCoom...</i>

116
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:02,445
<i>...Eraser Gun!!</i>

117
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:08,875
Vegeta<i>-san</i>!

118
00:18:37,455 --> 00:18:42,355
Move! You're in my way!
W-Who asked you to do that?!

119
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:58,465
Y-You idiot! If you had time to rescue me,
why didn't you attack ReaCoom?!

120
00:18:58,505 --> 00:19:03,845
For crying out loud, your
softness makes me want to vomit!

121
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:20,955
The ground's surface has been blown away,
and the planet's shape has changed...

122
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,695
What a terrifying beast!

123
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:32,495
That sneak attack just
now was a pretty good one.

124
00:19:32,535 --> 00:19:36,505
Coming down from
directly above shut my mouth.

125
00:19:36,545 --> 00:19:41,875
As a result, my teeth are messed up.
I think I might be a little bit mad.

126
00:19:43,915 --> 00:19:47,855
Hey, Butta, Jheese!

127
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:52,485
Let me take out these two little squirts, too!

128
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,325
Do you mind? Okay? Do you mind?

129
00:19:57,535 --> 00:19:59,325
What choice do we have?

130
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,125
Okay, fine! Do as you please.

131
00:20:02,165 --> 00:20:07,465
In exchange, you're going to
treat us to chocolate parfaits later!

132
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:12,505
Okay! You heard him, maggot<i>-kun.</i>

133
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:27,355
<i>Big Fire Toe Attack!!</i>

134
00:20:31,935 --> 00:20:34,365
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

135
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:37,365
Kuririn<i>-san</i>! Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

136
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:41,565
M-My bones... How can this be?

137
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:46,535
With just one hit...
this is what happens to me...

138
00:20:46,575 --> 00:20:49,405
He's too much...

139
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:52,545
I-Is this allowed?

140
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:57,415
And after having Grand
Elder<i>-san</i> raise my power, too...

141
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:59,415
I-I'm no use at all...

142
00:20:59,455 --> 00:21:04,855
S-Shake it off, Kuririn<i>-san</i>! Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

143
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:09,225
F-Frankly, we're finished...

144
00:21:09,265 --> 00:21:13,435
We're powerless against them, and
if we run, they'll catch us right away...

145
00:21:13,475 --> 00:21:17,305
And the Dragon Balls have been taken from us...

146
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:21,575
There's nothing good about this...

147
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:28,315
Tch! Aw, man... I couldn't
help myself, and hit him too hard.

148
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:32,285
I was planning to play around
with him a little more, but too bad.

149
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:36,495
Now then, for the next
little pipsqueak's turn...

150
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:40,295
Darn it!

151
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:41,895
G-Gohan...

152
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:48,135
I-I'll do as much as I can! Just you watch me!

153
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:51,945
This should be interesting.

154
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,875
Darn it...

155
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:18,635
<i>ReaCoom is an incredible foe.</i>

156
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:23,875
<i>Will Gohan be able to get</i>
<i>through this greatest of pinches?</i>

157
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:48,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

158
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

159
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

160
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

161
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

162
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,985
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

163
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:19,495
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

164
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

165
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

166
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

167
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

168
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

169
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

170
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

171
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

172
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,565
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

173
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:14,485
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

174
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:16,715
<i>That's enough. Don't get up anymore, Gohan.</i>

175
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:20,455
<i>I-I am Son Goku's son! You won't...</i>

176
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:24,925
<i>Oho, aren't you spirited? I don't</i>
<i>know what planet you're from, kid,</i>

177
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,725
<i>but this is surprising.</i>

178
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,625
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

179
00:24:28,665 --> 00:24:32,735
<i>"Don't Die, Gohan! Goku Finally</i>
<i>Touches Down on the Battlefield."</i>

180
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:34,735
<i>Father is here!</i>

181
00:24:34,775 --> 00:24:38,265
"Next time"
"Don't Die, Gohan! Goku Finally
Touches Down on the Battlefield"
