<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,960
It isn't dead, it's a shell that's been cast-off.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,630
This is probably from whatever came
out of the egg back in the time machine.

18
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,440
It must have started
growing, and then shed its skin.

19
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,350
Whatever came out of here,
it must have just barely happened.

20

<i>A strange egg is discovered</i>

00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,870
Er, yes?

28
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,310
What do you suppose that
strange shedding was, anyhow?

29
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,540
I-I don't know.

30
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,750
For one thing, we don't have
creatures like that in my era, either.

31
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,420
You said it came back a whole
year earlier than the time you arrived

32
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,760
three years ago,

33
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,330
which makes it a full four years
ago that it arrived in this era, right?

34
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,660
Yeah.

35
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,330
That's what the chronometer
inside the time machine indicated.

36
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,330
So without anyone realizing it,

37
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,570
a creature that came from a
good 23 years into the future...

38
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:52,140
...has been growing and developing
on our earth for the last four years.

39
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,810
Yeah.

40
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,150
Who could possibly have sent
that creature, and for what purpose?

41
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,880
These are the best clothes the store has?

42
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,480
Yes, quite so.

43
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
They look very flattering on you.

44
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,160
How do you like them?

45
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,330
How do you think I like them?

46
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,730
They're the absolute worst.

47
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,760
But considering how rural this place is,
I guess I'll have to make do for now.

48
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,770
See you.

49
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,880
E-Excuse me, ma'am, you haven't paid!

50
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,740
Hey!

51
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,410
Hey now, see here!

52
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,020
How... frightful!

53
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,370
Hello, is this the police?

54
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,380
My store has been robbed!
T-They drove away in...

55
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,350
It's the police again.

56
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,380
They're sure starting to get bothersome.

57
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,980
Don't you find this a little
painful to just be dreaming?

58
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:59,090
We interrupt this program to
bring you this late breaking news.

59
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,360
About an hour ago,

60
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,770
we took a number of calls from
Gingertown, a suburban area of Metro West.

61
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,770
We immediately dispatched
an investigate crew to the scene,

62
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,340
but according to their report,

63
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,540
the town's citizens seem to
have all suddenly vanished,

64
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,380
and there is no sign of anyone.

65
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,350
Gingertown?

66
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:24,150
The cause for this unexpected state of affairs

67
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,530
is currently under investigation, as we...

68
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,390
That's near where that other time machine was!

69
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,600
C-Can it be?

70
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,540
Yes, hello?

71
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,980
Hello? It's Bulma. Who's this? Kuririn?

72
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,820
Yes, it's Kuririn.

73
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,220
Gohan and Trunks?
No, they haven't come back yet.

74
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,360
Okay, turn on your TV there.
It's probably on every channel by now,

75
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,330
but I'm watching it on channel 872.

76
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,160
Has something happened?

77
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,930
Just hurry!

78
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,370
What's the matter? Who is it?

79
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,340
It's Bulma<i>-san.</i> She wants us to watch TV.

80
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,740
What is she telling us to watch?

81
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:23,220
Knowing Bulma, she's probably on right now.

82
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,610
Could be.

83
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,950
We've just received some new information.

84
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,360
According to the investigation
of our on-the-scene crew,

85
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,190
the clothing of the apparent
victims of this incident

86
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,200
is being discovered in great numbers.

87
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,560
Our camera crew has just arrived in the area,

88
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,570
so let's go there for a live update.

89
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,010
W-What could this be?

90
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,310
I've just arrived here in Gingertown,

91
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,940
where over 15,000 residents
have suddenly vanished.

92
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,550
We have just made a new discovery.

93
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,420
15,000 people...

94
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,750
There are many sets of clothing here.

95
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,820
It appears as if the people
inside them simply melted away.

96
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,560
As you can see in these images,

97
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,030
from the outlay of the clothing
and the presence of the rifles,

98
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,260
it appears they were
fighting against something...

99
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,100
W-What's this?

100
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:20,270
T-The Artificial Humans!
So, they've finally started!

101
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,610
I don't think so.

102
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,840
And I think that Gohan<i>-kun</i>
and Trunks will say the same thing.

103
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,110
Which means,

104
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,580
you think there might be some
kind of link to the other time machine?

105
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,420
I don't think there can be any doubt.

106
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,360
When Gohan<i>-kun</i> and Trunks get
there, have them tell you everything.

107
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,920
Right.

108
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,330
Goku<i>-sa</i>'s sleepin' tight now.

109
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,000
He seems to be restin'
a lot easier than before.

110
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,270
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>!

111
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,140
Forgive the intrusion.

112
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,110
Uh, Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

113
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,950
G-Guys, come watch this news,
then answer me a question–

114
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,580
News?

115
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,530
What's this?

116
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,560
We heard a scream just a moment ago.

117
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,140
Gunfire! We're hearing gunfire.

118
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,540
It appears that the investigative team

119
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,210
or the police in this direction are agitated!

120
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,590
It's become quiet once again.

121
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,060
We're going to move in
as close as we can to see–

122
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,850
What is it?!

123
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,220
What is happening?! Come on!!

124
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,590
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>!

125
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,430
W-What is it? What is that monster?

126
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,870
Did you say monster?

127
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,070
What do you mean, monster?! Say something!!

128
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,410
What?

129
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,980
Change it to a different channel!

130
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,010
Right.

131
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,020
Help us!

132
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,030
The screaming has stopped.

133
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,980
Enough already!

134
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,020
Stop keeping it all to yourself!

135
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,860
You're going to tell me exactly what you saw.

136
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,460
Hey!!

137
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,000
V-Very well.

138
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,210
All right, start talking.

139
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,010
What kind of monster did
you see in the lower realm?

140
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,010
There's no need for me to bother speaking.

141
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:54,450
What's that?

142
00:12:54,490 --> 00:13:01,020
Once you and I merge and become
one being, you'll know what it is I saw.

143
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,890
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>!

144
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:06,330
So, you've finally made up your mind, then?

145
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,860
You must have seen some
kind of monster, all right.

146
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,430
Let's hurry this up.

147
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,840
We cannot allow there to be any more victims.

148
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,040
All right!

149
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:24,410
We will be fundamentally
based on who I am now, got that?

150
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,810
That will be fine.

151
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,820
You are much younger than I,
and have a far greater power.

152
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,690
It is a matter of course.

153
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,060
I serve as nothing more
than a means to power up,

154
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,070
and to contribute my vast wisdom.

155
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,230
Now, since you are to be the base,
you will place your hand upon me.

156
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,100
Right.

157
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,430
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>!

158
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,440
The time is upon us, Mister Popo.

159
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,140
Right now what the Earth needs is not a Kami...

160
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,010
...but rather, the mighty.

161
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,450
Piccolo has changed.

162
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,720
The evil in his heart has mostly disappeared.

163
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:45,360
Once we merge, it is unlikely
we will ever need to divide again.

164
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,030
Thank you for all your help, Mister Popo.

165
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,470
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>!

166
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,580
F-Farewell, Kami<i>-sama.</i> Don't die.

167
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,190
I am neither Kami nor Piccolo any longer.

168
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:55,250
I'm a Namekian who has long
since forgotten his real name.

169
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,080
So then, I'm off.

170
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,830
We have received no
further reports from the scene.

171
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,640
In all likelihood, our own staff members

172
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,440
have become victims of this same incident.

173
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,440
So, you think it's because of whatever
monster came out of that shell, then?

174
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,440
Yeah, probably.

175
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,210
That's what I think.

176
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,050
The locations are pretty close, and all.

177
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,830
I'm going to go make sure.

178
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,400
Whoa!

179
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,400
Hold it!

180
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,830
It's okay.

181
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,400
I can become a Super Saiyan.

182
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,010
The ones we should really be
fearful of are the Artificial Humans.

183
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,450
M-Maybe so, but...

184
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,840
I-I'm going too!

185
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,850
You can't go!

186
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,050
Goku<i>-sa</i> is still sleepin' up there!

187
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,520
Why can't you behave a little better?!

188
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,520
Mother, it's exactly
because Father is sick that I...

189
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,060
No way!

190
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,490
Even if the whole universe is
blowin' up, you'll stay at my side!

191
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,440
You mean...?

192
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,030
I'll go by myself.

193
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:23,910
Gohan<i>-san</i>, if anything happens,
you and the others have to be here,

194
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,510
to protect Goku<i>-san</i> from the Artificial Humans.

195
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,180
Right. Very well.

196
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,410
Hey, don't do anything crazy.

197
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,520
If it gets dangerous,
come back here quick, okay?

198
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,690
Yeah, he's right.

199
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,420
You're an important part of our resistance force

200
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,520
against the Artificial Humans!

201
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,060
Right. Now then, I'll be back.

202
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,030
So, you've shown yourself, you beast.

203
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,220
<i>The mysterious monster finally reveals himself.</i>

204
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:30,060
<i>The world slips into a state of</i>
<i>hopelessness previously unknown.</i>

205
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,580
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

206
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,420
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

207
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,790
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

208
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,290
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

209
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,800
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

210
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,900
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

211
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

212
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,040
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

213
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,550
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

214
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,650
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

215
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,460
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

216
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,490
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

217
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:45,170
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

218
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,340
<i>So sorry.</i>

219
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,470
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

220
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,480
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

221
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,060
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

222
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,300
<i>Hmm? That ki is Freeza's...</i>

223
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,030
<i>What's more, Vegeta's and</i>
<i>Piccolo's are also all combined into one.</i>

224
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,370
<i>What on earth is going on?</i>

225
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,370
<i>What exactly are you, monster?</i>

226
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,640
<i>You're going to tell me everything,</i>
<i>even if I have to use force!</i>

227
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

228
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,150
<i>"Kamehame-Ha!?</i>
<i>The Monster Who Possesses Goku's Ki."</i>

229
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,460
<i>I can't believe I'm sensing</i>
<i>Father's ki from that thing!</i>

230
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,190
"Next time"
"Kamehame-Ha!?
The Monster Who Possesses Goku's Ki"
