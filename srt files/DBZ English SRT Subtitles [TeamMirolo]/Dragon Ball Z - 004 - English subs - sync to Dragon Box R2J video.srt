00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,320
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:52,190
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10

15
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,890
<i>In order to rescue Gohan,</i>
<i>who had been kidnapped by Raditz,</i>

17
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,530
<i>Goku and Piccolo took off after them together.</i>

18
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,440
<i>However, in the face of the</i>
<i>overwhelming power of Raditz,</i>

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:17,280
<i>Goku and Piccolo had to take on a</i>
<i>battle more difficult than any other before.</i>

20
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,020
Why don't I let you in on
something good before you die?

21
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,760
The other two Saiyans have a
battle power even higher than mine!

22
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:12,830
<i>"Piccolo's Trump Card!</i>
<i>Gohan, the Crybaby-kun."</i>

23
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,780
D-Dammit! You say the other
two Saiyans are even stronger?!

24
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,980
W-What's going on here?

25
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,550
It's too late for you now, even if you
do realize how terrible we Saiyans are!

26
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,790
You've got us there.
I wish we hadn't heard that.

27
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,520
There's only one thing that fools,

28
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,430
who defy me without heeding the
warnings I so graciously offered, get...

29
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,160
...and that's death.

30
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,060
You must be pretty excited, huh, Son Goku?

31
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,540
Sorry, but this time, I ain't all that excited.

32
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,870
I'm so scared, I'm trembling!

33
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,050
Of course you are! However, that
terror will turn to hopelessness very soon.

34
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:33,480
Never mind me, where is my son?!

35
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,420
Where have you hidden him?!

36
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,990
I haven't hidden him. I just locked him
up because he was bawling so loudly.

37
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,590
There's a hole behind
you, right? He's in there.

38
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,180
In there, huh?

39
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,240
Gohan...

40
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,050
Father! Save me, Father!

41
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,480
Hold on, Gohan! Daddy's going
to come rescue you right away!

42
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,490
Don't be ridiculous!

43
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,970
There's no way you can save him!

44
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,360
Not if you guys die first!

45
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,370
All right, let's do it!

46
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,740
That's all we can do!

47
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,390
Behind me!

48
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,990
Yikes!

49
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,810
Where did you go?!

50
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,680
I'm right here.

51
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,740
Even with both of you coming at me,

52
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,220
this isn't even worth wasting my breath on!

53
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,890
Damn... Are you okay, Piccolo?

54
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,140
R-Relax. I can still manage
to fight with o-only one arm.

55
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,810
It looks like your deaths
are finally drawing near, huh?!

56
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,200
I-I wonder if Goku is doing okay.

57
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,040
For some reason, I have this
strange, uneasy feeling in my chest.

58
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,000
I've never felt anything like this before.

59
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,910
I hope nothing bad is happening.

60
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:56,510
Listen, teamed up with Piccolo,
he's not going to be done in so easily.

61
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,810
That's all the more reason to be concerned!

62
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,020
What if Piccolo double-crosses Goku,

63
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,620
and teams up with that Raditz guy?

64
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,020
If those two are done in, then
there's nothing left that we can do.

65
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,060
It will be the end of everything!

66
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,200
<i>Goku...</i>

67
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,180
What's the matter?
Are you finished already?

68
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,810
Where did all that gusto you had earlier go?

69
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,550
Hey, Son Goku, do you have
any new reserve techniques?

70
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,520
Sorry, can't say I do.

71
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,720
Sheesh, ease up, will you?

72
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,430
And here I've been training
seriously, developing something new.

73
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,860
What are you two whispering about?

74
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,930
Whatever strategy you devise, it won't work!

75
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,570
It'd be easier on you if
you'd just keel over right away.

76
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,940
Are you for real? You've got
yourself a new technique up your sleeve?

77
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,810
Yeah.

78
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,940
Can you do it with only one arm?

79
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,080
Yeah, that part's okay.

80
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,520
But this technique takes quite a bit
of time in order to build up enough <i>ki.</i>

81
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,460
While I'm doing that, you fight him
by yourself, and draw his attention.

82
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,330
Got it! Will this technique work against him?

83
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,930
Probably. If this doesn't work,
then there's no other way to defeat him.

84
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,350
I was saving this in order to kill you.

85
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,840
And instead, you might
end up saving me with it, huh?

86
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,320
If I am able to defeat him
with this, then your turn is next.

87
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,490
Is that right?

88
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,290
This is no time to be laughing, you know.

89
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,930
<i>They're laughing... So they're</i>
<i>changing their posture, are they?</i>

90
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,500
All right, I'm looking forward to this!

91
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,770
Now then, let's see
about keeping him in check!

92
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,040
Hang in there as best you can!

93
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,650
<i>Makankosappo!</i>

94
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,150
<i>So, you've finally resigned yourself?</i>

95
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,410
You're a persistent one!

96
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,150
Ka...

97
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,610
me...

98
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,180
I-Impossible!

99
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:28,090
His battle power is rising!
Battle power 924... 925!

100
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,220
ha...

101
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:35,530
He's able to concentrate his battle
power into one point and raise it up?!

102
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,170
me...

103
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,040
T-This one's battle power
is now 1,020! U-Unbelievable!

104
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,610
It's still going up!

105
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,150
<i>Ha!</i>

106
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,170
You've got a lot of nerve!

107
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,630
He caught it!

108
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,710
W-What kind of guy is this?

109
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,680
This time, I'll present you with one!

110
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,370
Die!

111
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,220
You're going to be the one who dies!

112
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:48,530
Battle power 1,330?!

113
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,700
A-All of his battle power is
gathered into just his fingertip!

114
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,710
Dammit! These guys can
manipulate their powers at will!

115
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,310
Try taking this on! <i>Makankosappo!</i>

116
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:52,630
H-He avoided it! W-What kind
of bastard is he, with such speed?

117
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:56,630
You pierced through this armor quite easily.

118
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:58,540
That's quite a technique.

119
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,300
If I had taken that head-on,
I would have been out!

120
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,670
That doesn't mean anything if I don't hit you!

121
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,340
To think that you would inflict injury upon me!

122
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,850
You're going to pay for this!
I'm through playing around!

123
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,880
W-We've had it now!

124
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
I'll obliterate you in an instant!

125
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,970
Rot in hell!

126
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,050
You got careless, didn't you?!

127
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,730
I've got your tail!

128
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,440
Why, you... when did you get behind me?!

129
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,170
Piccolo! Now! Do that thing one more time!

130
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,680
Y-You got it!

131
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,510
Nicely done, Goku!
Keep a firm grip on that tail!

132
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:21,680
I'm limited to only being able
to use this technique one more time.

133
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,520
K-Kakarrot! Are you planning
to kill your one and only brother?!

134
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:32,690
Shut up! I told you, any guy as cruel
as you are ain't any brother of mine!

135
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:36,760
As someone who was going to kill my son,
don't you go saying that self-serving junk!

136
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,700
I-I'll stop! I've had a change of heart!

137
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,700
I'll leave this planet without
making any more trouble!

138
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,770
Don't be fooled, Son Goku!
There's no truth in what he's saying!

139
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,950
There's no way he would do that!

140
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:56,280
P-Please! Believe me, my younger brother!

141
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,120
Truly, I have done
some cruel things up to now!

142
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,960
To you, as well... But I will
keep my promise, no matter what!

143
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,860
Y-You really mean it?

144
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,960
I-I really do!

145
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,240
N-No! Don't let go of
his tail! That's his tactic!

146
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,950
I'm begging you, Kakarrot! B-Believe me!

147
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,990
Son Goku!

148
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,000
Y-You miserable idiot!

149
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,610
Indeed! Fools such as
yourself are quite uncommon!

150
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,120
To think that you would
be so completely taken in!

151
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,560
Just as I thought, there's no
way that you could be a warrior!

152
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,520
T-That was dirty!

153
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,590
But I'm not like you.
I'm a first-rate warrior!

154
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,540
I have absolutely no hesitations about
killing you, even if you are my brother!

155
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,800
Shall I provide you with a sample?

156
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,540
Father...

157
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:39,680
There you go, there you go!
Suffer even more! Your death is near!

158
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,500
What's the matter?
Aren't you going to come at me?

159
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,030
Try doing that thing you did earlier!

160
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,070
H-He'll just dodge it again like this!

161
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,110
Father...

162
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,580
That Gohan! I told him that
once he gets his tests back,

163
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,440
he should show them to me.

164
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,610
Still, you've done very well, Gohan.

165
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,850
Sure enough, it's worth it for him to
be studyin' every day for eight hours.

166
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,380
Once I show this to Goku,
I'm sure he'll say the same thing.

167
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,920
I sure wish Goku and Gohan
would both get back soon.

168
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,450
Scream some more! Cry out!

169
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,450
Your turn comes next!

170
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,610
Get yourself ready!

171
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,430
Well now, shall I finally
put you out of your misery?

172
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:32,600
Die, Kakarrot!

173
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,510
<i>W-What?</i>

174
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,110
What?!

175
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:17,020
<i>With his father in a great pinch,</i>
<i>Son Gohan instinctively springs forth!</i>

176
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,520
<i>Though his body may be small,</i>
<i>his anger is something fierce!</i>

177
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,410
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

178
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,280
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

179
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,650
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

180
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,160
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

181
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,630
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

182
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,740
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

183
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:18,240
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

184
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,910
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

185
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,420
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

186
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,490
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

187
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,320
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

188
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,390
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

189
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:44,060
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

190
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,230
<i>So sorry.</i>

191
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,340
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

192
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:59,320
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

193
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,630
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

194
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,900
<i>Gohan, don't go near him!</i>

195
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,230
<i>I'll hit him with my Makankosappo again!</i>

196
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:24,340
<i>Kuririn, this dying</i>
<i>stuff is pretty nasty, ain't it?</i>

197
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,410
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

198
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,840
<i>"Goku Dies!</i>
<i>There's Only One Last Chance."</i>

199
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,990
<i>Stop picking on my father!</i>

200
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,790
"Next time"
"Goku Dies!
There's Only One Last Chance"
