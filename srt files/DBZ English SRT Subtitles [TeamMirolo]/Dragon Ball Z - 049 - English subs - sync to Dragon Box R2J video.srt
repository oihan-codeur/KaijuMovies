3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,590
Stop!

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,390
<i>Gohan's furious power had erupted over</i>
<i>the vicious methods of Freeza and his men.</i>

18
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:32,770
You dumbass! Run! Hurry!

19
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,070
Dodoria<i>-san</i>, catch them.

20
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,550
Take this!

21
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,620
<i>Taiyo-ken!</i>

22
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:56,730
M-My eyes!

23
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:02,570
<i>Will Kuririn and the others be</i>
<i>successful in getting out of this pinch?</i>

24
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:10,470
<i>"Dodoria Dies by Explosion!</i>
<i>Vegeta's Fearsome Shockwave."</i>

25
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,950
Why, you–!

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,760
Where did you go, dammit?!

27
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,600
Damn you...

28
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,940
Where are you?! Come on out!

29
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,780
Damn...

30
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,530
It's okay. There's no way he'll find us.

31
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,300
Having that old timer destroy
those Scouter things really did save us.

32
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,140
If he still had one, he'd be able to
locate even that little kid's <i>ki</i>, after all.

33
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,540
Damn. How am I supposed to find
those tiny little guys?! This is infuriating!

34
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,360
Thank goodness. He's giving up and going back.

35
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,740
I'll blow them away!

36
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,570
See you in hell!

37
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,740
Take that. That's what you
get for giving me a hard time.

38
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,080
Freeza<i>-sama</i> told me to bring them back,

39
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,880
but I guess this is better
than letting them get away.

40
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,720
Still, I never did find out
who those little brats really were.

41
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,560
They weren't any ordinary folks. But I
suppose it doesn't make any difference now.

42
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,740
We're saved!

43
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,270
For now, let's get back
to where Bulma<i>-san</i> is, okay?

44
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,800
Are you able to fly?

45
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,470
Yes.

46
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,820
T-Thank you for saving me.

47
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,460
Say your thanks to Gohan here.

48
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,660
I was so fazed that I didn't
even want to try saving you.

49
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,930
But if you hadn't helped,
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, both of us would be dead.

50
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,470
Well, at any rate, come along with us.

51
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,500
It's not like there's anything shady about us.

52
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,620
Okay.

53
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:03,670
There <i>are</i> Dragon Balls here, but there are
these strange guys gathering them all up,

54
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,840
and if they make off with all of them like this,

55
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,640
then it doesn't make any sense
why a delicate young lady like myself...

56
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,850
...has risked all of this danger to
come to this planet, does it? Am I right?

57
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,290
Hey, are you listening to me, Dad?!

58
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,490
<i>Yeah, I'm listening to every word.</i>
<i>So, what's the matter?</i>

59
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,830
It's just that this whole situation
is just in the worst state it could be in.

60
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,070
Our spaceship was wrecked by these weirdos,
so there's no way we can come back home.

61
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,850
You're coming back home?

62
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,680
Well, isn't that going to cause trouble?

63
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,190
I mean, Goku has just barely left to head there.

64
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,890
Won't it be a shame
if you two miss each other?

65
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,860
Son<i>-kun</i>? Son<i>-kun</i> is
coming here to Planet Namek?

66
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,670
Really, really, really he is?

67
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:09,910
<i>Yeah, that's right. According to</i>
<i>schedule, he should get there in six days.</i>

68
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,880
Hooray!

69
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,820
<i>But there is one thing that has me concerned...</i>

70
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,850
Huh? What?

71
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:28,420
<i>He took off without</i>
<i>having the speakers installed.</i>

72
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,900
<i>Does Goku not listen to music and such?</i>

73
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,830
I've been training too
seriously, and now I'm hungry!

74
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,840
Aw, is this all there is?

75
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,820
Just this much ain't going to be enough.

76
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,050
Ah, I'm full, I'm full!

77
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,530
Oh, whoops. The
gravity device is still turned on.

78
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,510
Still, without Scouters, it's going to be
a pain looking for the last two Dragon Balls.

79
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,080
Well, this isn't all that large a planet.

80
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,120
V-Vegeta! Why, you–!

81
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,120
Yo, it's been quite a long
while, huh, Dodoria<i>-san</i>?

82
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,360
You're the one who hit me when
I wasn't looking, aren't you, Vegeta?!

83
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,470
You and Zarbon are always
palling around with Freeza, after all.

84
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,100
I've been waiting until
you were all on your own.

85
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,310
I should be able to take you, as
long as Freeza isn't around, you see.

86
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:38,950
What? A Saiyan like you?! You've
got some nerve saying that, don't you?!

87
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,520
Vegeta, hand over that
Scouter to me quietly, and get lost.

88
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,130
If you do so, I'll let you slide this one time.

89
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,330
You will? I thought something had
happened when the sound suddenly cut out.

90
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,570
It looks like you guys have
lost all your Scouters, all right.

91
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,740
This is great. Now you won't be
able to tell when I come up to you guys.

92
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,380
What did you say?!

93
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:54,050
It will take several days for you to go
get more Scouters from Planet Freeza.

94
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,420
I'll bet you want this.

95
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,870
You've decided to hand it over, huh?

96
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,910
It's about time you realized
the terror of your situation.

97
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,120
Now, if you're lucky, you just
might at least have your life spared.

98
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:43,000
H-How could you do that, Vegeta?!

99
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,970
Why the hell did you break it?!

100
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,250
I didn't have any further need of it.

101
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,320
W-What? Without that thing,

102
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,660
you can't tell where Freeza<i>-sama</i>
or the Namekians are, either!

103
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,730
Sorry to disappoint you, but
when I was fighting the Earthlings,

104
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,130
I found out that they could determine

105
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,540
an opponent's strength
and location without a Scouter.

106
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,770
Also, there was a Saiyan, like myself,
there on Earth, who had this ability.

107
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,950
Which meant that I should
be able to do it as well.

108
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,130
Once you learn how to do it, it's easy.

109
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:39,690
But then, for those like yourselves or Freeza,

110
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,700
who only set their sights on
power, it would be impossible.

111
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,330
Although, up until now, I was the same way.

112
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,270
I see now. Those runts I was chasing
earlier were Earthlings, weren't they?!

113
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,110
Earthlings, you say?

114
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:58,680
You joined forces with
the Earthlings, didn't you?!

115
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
What kind of nonsense is that?

116
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,690
There's no way that Earthlings
could come all the way here.

117
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,020
And if they were here, the first
thing I would do is go dispose of them.

118
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,900
None of that makes any difference!
You just get out of here!

119
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,930
Unless you want to get killed, that is!

120
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,310
I'm offering to let you go.
You should be grateful!

121
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,180
What are you so frightened for?
Why don't you come at me, already?

122
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,080
I know why you don't.

123
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,320
You found out during my fight with Kewie
that I've become far stronger than before,

124
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,760
and you're afraid of me!

125
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,070
What happened, Zarbon?

126
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,100
I-I think it was a malfunction,

127
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,210
but the rating on my Scouter, which was
set on Vegeta, had just risen above 22,000...

128
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,050
What? 22,000, you say?
That has to be a malfunction, you fool.

129
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,250
You saw it on your Scouter, right?

130
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,090
My battle power?

131
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,690
T-That rating was wrong!
A malfunction in the Scouter!

132
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,140
Don't you belittle me!

133
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,050
<i>You're</i> the one who's belittling <i>me.</i>

134
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,110
There's no way that technique
is going to work on me, you know!

135
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,670
We Saiyans grow stronger every time we fight.

136
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,240
The stronger my opponent is,
the more my own strength increases,

137
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,650
so after nearly dying on Earth,
I have powered up considerably.

138
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,320
Such is the warrior race, the Saiyans.

139
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:31,100
This is what happens to you for letting
that power you're so proud of go neglected.

140
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,270
Die, and come back
next time as a harder worker!

141
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,670
Wait, Vegeta! If you let me
go now, I'll let you in on a secret!

142
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,280
I-It's about your world, Planet Vegeta!

143
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,510
What?

144
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,620
Did you say Planet Vegeta?
What secret is there about Planet Vegeta?!

145
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,920
Let go! Let go of me, and I'll tell you!

146
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,170
Y-You're not planning to kill
me right after I tell you, are you?

147
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,640
If you don't tell me, I'll kill
you right now! Start talking!

148
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,210
Y-You Saiyans' Planet Vegeta

149
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:26,050
wasn't wiped out when a giant
meteor struck it, like Freeza<i>-sama</i> said.

150
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,460
What?!

151
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:20,440
Individually, the Saiyans' powers
were a far cry from Freeza<i>-sama</i>'s,

152
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,210
but if a large number of
Saiyans were to unite together,

153
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,410
it would become fairly troublesome.

154
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,620
What's more, there were small
groups of Saiyans being born, like yourself,

155
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,460
who were outstanding warriors,
and their numbers were increasing.

156
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:42,630
Figuring that once you started
having such extraordinary power,

157
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,070
you weren't the sort of race that would just
go on obediently following orders forever,

158
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,970
so Freeza<i>-sama</i> decided that it was
necessary to take measures as of right then.

159
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,680
And so...

160
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:21,170
And so, Freeza<i>-sama</i> himself obliterated
Planet Vegeta, along with all the Saiyans.

161
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,440
However, Vegeta, you
should be grateful to Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

162
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,880
He thought he could use the prodigious
talents of you, the prince of Planet Vegeta,

163
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:36,150
so Freeza<i>-sama</i> went to the trouble of
going after the planet when you were not on it.

164
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,330
Looks like this comes
as a great shock, all right.

165
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,460
I'm going to use the chance it
gives me to return to Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

166
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,700
Don't misunderstand, Dodoria.

167
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,540
I don't care about the planet,
or my pals, or my parents.

168
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,410
I'm just furious at myself for not knowing this,

169
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:06,290
and allowing myself to be used according
to your whims ever since I was a kid!

170
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:10,680
Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

171
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,050
Freeza fears the bottomless
potential of the Saiyans.

172
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:57,940
I've got to hurry and conquer
this twenty-times gravity quickly.

173
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,240
Okay... guess I'll get started.

174
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,880
One... two... One... two...

175
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,690
<i>Goku is full of energy.</i>

176
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,260
<i>Vegeta keeps on gaining more power.</i>

177
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,860
<i>The time when these two</i>
<i>will once again clash is near.</i>

178
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

179
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

180
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

181
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

182
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

183
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

184
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

185
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

186
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

187
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

188
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

189
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

190
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

191
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

192
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

193
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

194
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,900
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

195
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,510
<i>Hey, Goku, bad news. It seems</i>
<i>your spaceship has been damaged.</i>

196
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,780
<i>Unless you do something,</i>
<i>you're going to collide with a planet.</i>

197
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,950
<i>Oh, no! I'm not about to let</i>
<i>myself die before I fight Vegeta!</i>

198
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,720
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

199
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,190
<i>"Escape From a Burning Planet!!</i>
<i>A Life-or-Death Kamehame-Ha."</i>

200
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,100
<i>Father, the force of 20 Gs is amazing, huh?</i>

201
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,230
"Next time"
"Escape From a Burning Planet!!
A Life-or-Death <i>Kamehame-Ha"</i>
