00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,430

<i>M-My power...</i>

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,920
<i>And so, the first casualty</i>
<i>of their massacre is Yamucha.</i>

21
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,950
<i>Is this the terrible power of the Artificial Humans?</i>

There's a large <i>ki</i> in distress,
and it's growing smaller! Whose is it?

24
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,120
Is that Yamucha<i>-san</i>?

25
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
They've shown themselves!

26
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,330
Yamucha!

27
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,820
<i>Aw, damn.</i>

28
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,860
Kuririn, Yamucha is still alive.

29
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,500
I left the senzu back where we were earlier.

30
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,200
Take him there and feed him one.

31
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,070
You got it.

32
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,500
We're counting on you, Kuririn!

33
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,130
Yeah.

34
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,350
So you're the Artificial Humans?

35
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,160
About time you showed your faces.

36
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:49,090
Strange. How did you know
we were Artificial Humans?

37
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,460
What's more...

38
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,300
you seemed to know we would
be appearing here on this island.

39
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,870
Why don't you tell me how you knew?

40
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,820
Well now, how about you try
to force the answers out of us?

41
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,320
That we will.

42
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,770
Wait! There'll be too many casualties here!

43
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,570
Let's relocate to someplace
where nobody's around!

44
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,680
You guys okay with that?

45
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,110
Someplace where no one else is?

46
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,710
Very well.

47
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,150
However, we need not
trouble ourselves with relocating.

48
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,150
Stop it!!

49
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,740
What was that? What's happened?

50
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:17,740
It's them. They did this.

51
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,320
How awful!

52
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,290
Mommy!

53
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,140
Why you...

54
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,110
I thought I would make us a
place where no one else was around.

55
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,120
Apparently you still don't like it here.

56
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,280
Come with me!

57
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
I'm going to smash the both of you!!

58
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,120
You cannot defeat us.

59
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,960
Dammit!

60
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,730
Very well. We will follow you.

61
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,370
Choose the place you wish to die, Son Goku.

62
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,100
How did you know Goku's name?

63
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,310
We know who you are as well.

64
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,940
Piccolo and Tenshinhan, isn't it?

65
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,730
We'll talk about this later.

66
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,360
Let's go!

67
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,040
It's Father, and the others!

68
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,440
And those two guys are with them.

69
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,340
What?

70
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,210
I get it, they must be changing locations.

71
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:02,680
This is bad! I've got to warn Goku!

72
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
Those guys suck the power out of you!

73
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,380
Oh, yeah!

74
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,970
This is a special newscast.

75
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,700
We've just received word
that the city on Amembo Island,

76
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,240
nine kilometers southwest of Metro South...

77
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,810
has been attacked by an unknown party,
and has in large part been leveled.

78
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,420
He said southwest of Metro South, right?

79
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,790
That's where Ten<i>-san</i> went!

80
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,560
So then... they've actually appeared.

81
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,130
Artificial Humans from the Red Ribbon Army.

82
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:24,130
Currently there is no
communication with the city,

83
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,770
and there is concern for
the safety of its inhabitants.

84
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,930
Ten<i>-san</i>!

85
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,940
Hey, there's nothing to worry about.

86
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,140
This time Goku's been there from the start.

87
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,780
This is sure to be an easy
victory for them, you know.

88
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,810
That's right! Goku is a Super Saiyan,
the strongest warrior in the universe!

89
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,760
Yeah, you're right.

90
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,020
<i>Goku, we're all counting on you.</i>

91
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,810
Yamucha<i>-san</i>, you say
they can suck out your power?

92
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,540
Yeah. I don't know how they do it,

93
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:48,550
but just by him grabbing me,
I could feel my power rapidly fading.

94
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:54,520
If that's right, then Doctor Gero
has invented quite a fearsome device.

95
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,760
This is terrible! We have to hurry
and go warn Father and the others!

96
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,730
To be honest, I don't even want to go.

97
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,960
I want nothing to do with it.

98
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,800
After all, I was helpless to
stop them from nearly killing me!

99
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,570
Gohan!

100
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,770
Yamucha<i>-san</i>, I'm going.
I have to take them the senzu.

101
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,180
You guys! None of you understand...

102
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,020
...how terrible these Artificial Humans are!

103
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,760
Dammit! I'm not going to do anything!

104
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm just going to watch now!

105
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,970
Heh. Whatta fool he is.

106
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,780
Say, aren't you going?

107
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,180
Of course I ain't goin'.

108
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,380
"Ain't goin'?" Aren't you
supposed to be pretty strong too?

109
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,550
At a time like this, we need
as many guys as we can get!

110
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:04,890
Your friends, the Earth,
everything's caught in this pinch.

111
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,790
Yeah, prob'ly.

112
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,560
"Yeah, prob'ly?!"

113
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,230
You don't care about
anything at all! How very shabby!

114
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,260
I can't fly, y'know.

115
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,800
Sorry.

116
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,580
Enough is enough, Son Goku!

117
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,810
How far were you thinking of going?

118
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,990
Right here is fine. I'm making this the spot.

119
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,830
You have no claim over
us to choose the location.

120
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,790
<i>A tableland, but surrounded</i>
<i>on all sides by rocks.</i>

121
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:53,830
<i>If it becomes necessary, they figure they</i>
<i>can fight us while hiding among the rocks.</i>

122
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,010
These guys have thought this out.

123
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,350
So, before we start fighting,

124
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,980
tell us how you know so much about us.

125
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:18,760
<i>What's going on? Goku's out of breath.</i>

126
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,230
<i>All we've done so far is fly here.</i>

127
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,890
<i>Why is that?</i>

128
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,370
Very well, I'll tell you.

129
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:37,820
Afterward, you'll probably
wish you hadn't asked.

130
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,190
Son Goku, you've been
under constant surveillance,

131
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,290
through the use of miniature,
grub-like spy robots.

132
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,810
During the Tenkaichi Martial Arts Tournaments...

133
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,820
...as well as your battles
with Piccolo and Vegeta.

134
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:39,010
The research has been ongoing from the
time you destroyed the Red Ribbon Army.

135
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,570
How could Son Goku be defeated?

136
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,840
What kind of Artificial
Human would be necessary?

137
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,250
This was to get even with me?

138
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,610
Yes it was.

139
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:54,250
Because of you, the Red Ribbon Army's
dream of world conquest was shattered,

140
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,250
and only Doctor Gero remained.

141
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,330
The way you say that, it almost
sounds as if you were Doctor Gero himself.

142
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,990
Don't be absurd.

143
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:08,270
I am No. 20, an Artificial Human
constructed by Doctor Gero.

144
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,870
Doctor Gero has died,
and is no longer of this world.

145
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,270
I see. So did you guys spy on me during
the fight on the planet Namek as well?

146
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,180
There was no need. After your fight with Vegeta,

147
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,650
we had a complete knowledge
of your strengths and abilities.

148
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,020
Of course, should you
become more powerful still,

149
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,620
taking into account your age...

150
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:31,720
...it was calculated that there could be no
more tremendous increases in your power.

151
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,470
This is bad!

152
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,470
Looks as though no one's started fighting yet,

153
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,240
and everyone is still suppressing their <i>ki.</i>

154
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,840
We'll never find them like this!

155
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,010
Where are you?! Where are you?!

156
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,190
It looks as though you've failed...

157
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,160
...to investigate the most
important thing about me.

158
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,160
You guys lose!

159
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,160
What?

160
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,170
It will cost you your lives not to
have known about the Super Saiyan.

161
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,970
Super Saiyan?

162
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,830
This way!

163
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,990
<i>What an incredible ki!</i>

164
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,830
<i>Can his power really be this great?</i>

165
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:23,100
You two stay out of this.

166
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,440
It would appear I'm the
one they want most, after all.

167
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,780
You certainly have achieved
quite an increase in power.

168
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,150
No. 20, this seems to be a
technique different from the <i>Kaio-ken.</i>

169
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,490
It's an unusual technique.

170
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,790
These readings are far
higher than what was calculated.

171
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,160
However, it is still not enough to overpower us.

172
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,960
To say nothing of myself,

173
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,410
at your level, it is unlikely
you could defeat even No. 19.

174
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:07,410
Oh really? Well, why don't I have
you show me this strength right now?

175
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:16,790
<i>The day of battle at long last arrives.</i>

176
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:21,160
<i>However, even as they face a</i>
<i>Goku who has turned Super Saiyan...</i>

177
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,400
<i>...what do these surprisingly at-ease</i>
<i>Artificial Humans have planned?</i>

178
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,690
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

179
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,530
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

180
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

181
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

182
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,910
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

183
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,010
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

184
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,520
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

185
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

186
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,660
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

187
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,760
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

188
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,570
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

189
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,600
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

190
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,280
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

191
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,450
<i>So sorry.</i>

192
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,580
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

193
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,590
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

194
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

195
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,340
<i>Damn, my body is acting funny.</i>

196
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,540
<i>Did those guys drain out my ki?</i>

197
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,450
<i>Good, No. 1 9's maximum power just shot up!</i>

198
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:26,720
<i>On the other hand, Son</i>
<i>Goku's energy is starting to fall off!</i>

199
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,790
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

200
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,520
<i>"Goku's Double-Shock!!</i>
<i>Caught Between Illness and Adversary."</i>

201
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,070
<i>Oh, no! How can he get sick now?!</i>

202
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,330
"Next time"
"Goku's Double-Shock!!
Caught Between Illness and Adversary"
