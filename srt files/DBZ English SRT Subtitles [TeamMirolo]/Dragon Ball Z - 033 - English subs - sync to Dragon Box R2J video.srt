3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:52,300
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:04,820

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,440

the Seas...

all living things...

20
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:08,040
Each of you, share with me
just a little bit of your <i>Genki</i> energy!

21
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,890
All right!

22
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,460
Take this!

23
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,970
This is the end for you, Kakarrot!

24
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,240
Die!

25
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,420
N-Now, I ain't even got
enough strength left to blow my nose...

26
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,860
D-Do as you like...

27
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,030
Why, you...!

28
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:00,660
I'm going to squeeze you to death!

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,150
<i>Goku's body, along with the fate</i>
<i>of the Earth, was about to be crushed!</i>

30
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,020
<i>"Don't Die, Father!!</i>
<i>This is the Depth of Gohan's Power."</i>

31
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,700
Don't you die, Goku.

32
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,080
Father...

33
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,430
That guy's intense.
It's no use. This is all over.

34
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,300
It's not like I'm desertin' ya, though.

35
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,300
There's just nothin' I can do.

36
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,870
Don't go holdin' it against me, 'kay?

37
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,110
Suffer good and long, and then die!

38
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,450
It's close! We're almost there!

39
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,160
Even though it's the evening, because
of that strange light, it's as bright as this.

40
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,540
W-What the hell is that thing?

41
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,750
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>, o-over there!

42
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,720
Get down, Gohan! Get down, and hide!

43
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,490
W-What is that?

44
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,120
Hurry up, you stupid twit!

45
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,460
Ah, it's those guys.

46
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,660
<i>It can't be... He's turned into a Great Ape!</i>

47
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,070
Feels like most of your bones
just broke, huh? Does it hurt?

48
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,710
Goku is getting done in! This is bad!

49
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:23,710
This way!

50
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,840
Right!

51
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,280
Hey!

52
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,720
Yajirobe!

53
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,290
Hey, who d'ya think that monster is?
It's the Saiyan, I tell ya, the Saiyan!

54
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,490
I know.

55
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,990
There's no way you can stand up
to that monster, you know! Give it up!

56
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:45,730
I know that, too. But if we cut
off his tail, he'll return to normal.

57
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,770
His tail?

58
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,770
Listen up.

59
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,070
Gohan and Yajirobe, you guys circle
around in front of him, and get his attention.

60
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,280
I'll find an opportunity to
cut off his tail from the back!

61
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,280
Hurry! Goku is going to die!

62
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,850
R-Right.

63
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,990
Y-Ya gotta be kiddin' me.

64
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,090
Get his attention, did'ja say?
You guys don't even know!

65
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,470
Even after he's back to normal, he's
still gonna have unbelievable strength!

66
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,740
<i>Father, don't die!</i>

67
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,880
<i>Goku's ki is almost completely gone!</i>
<i>Dammit, he's moments from death!</i>

68
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,860
Eh, do whatever you wanna.

69
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,040
There's something out there.

70
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,670
Where is it?

71
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,450
Over here!

72
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,630
L-Let my father go!

73
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,730
This is a surprise. If it isn't Kakarrot's kid.

74
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:27,900
I get it. So you've come here just to
see your father meet his end, have you?

75
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,600
You've got good timing.
He was just about to die.

76
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,880
I was right about to finish him off.

77
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,870
<i>Kienzan!</i>

78
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,100
Damn it all...

79
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:18,720
Watch very closely. I'm going to
crush him until there's nothing left.

80
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,450
<i>Kuririn-san, hurry!</i>

81
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,030
Unfortunately, it appears he
has already lost consciousness.

82
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,040
I-I-It can't be!

83
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:58,190
Did you think I wouldn't notice
that there was another one of you?

84
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,490
You guys seem to share some
worthless attachment for each other, after all.

85
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,400
There's no way this kid would
just come strolling back by himself,

86
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,300
so I was just waiting to see what would happen.

87
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,470
Apparently, you know
about our tails. Too bad for you.

88
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:22,650
Just you wait. Once I've taken care
of Kakarrot, it will be your turn next.

89
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,720
<i>D-Damn! What kind of beast is this?</i>

90
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,620
<i>Even after turning into a monster,</i>

91
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,720
<i>he still has his presence of</i>
<i>mind and his guard is flawless.</i>

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,990
<i>I'm sorry, Goku. I don't</i>
<i>want to just let you die,</i>

93
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:37,440
<i>but this guy's ki is so incredible,</i>
<i>I can't even get close to him.</i>

94
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,870
You guys were mistaken
to have challenged me to battle!

95
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,050
Dammit! If we don't do something...

96
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,420
Stop...

97
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:06,060
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

98
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:15,260
So, you want to die
ahead of your father, do you?

99
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,240
T-This is bad!

100
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,660
What's the matter? Too scared to move?

101
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:05,650
Dammit! I didn't know
there was yet another one!

102
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,460
My tail!

103
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,240
H-He did it!

104
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,210
I got nothin' to do with this...

105
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,050
I-I got nothin' to do with this from here on...

106
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,710
I-It's gone! His tail is gone!

107
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,550
You did it, Yajirobe!
He returned to his original form!

108
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,120
<i>It's not my problem... Whatever</i>
<i>happens now, it's not my problem...</i>

109
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,370
W-Why, you...!

110
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,110
You want to die so badly
that you've made me angry?!

111
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,380
W-What's going on? Why did that monster–?

112
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,950
In that case, as you wish,
I will kill you, you miserable scum!

113
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,930
<i>There, ya see?</i>

114
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,750
Gohan! Get out of there!

115
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,130
I'll start with you.

116
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,470
What's the matter? Wasn't a
Super Saiyan supposed to be strong?

117
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,140
Show me your true power.

118
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,950
Maybe the order has been changed.

119
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,890
There, you see? Don't say I didn't warn ya.

120
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,130
Come on, get up! Amuse me a little while longer.

121
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,710
Hey, what's wrong? Is that the best you can do?

122
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,710
I guess the son of scum...

123
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,910
...is scum, as well.

124
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,720
You may be scum, but it looks
like your blood is red, at least.

125
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,800
How awful!

126
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,740
How can he be so cruel to a child?!

127
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,970
She's strangely tranquil, huh?

128
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,350
I'm sure she must have run out of tears.

129
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,380
She hasn't fainted, has she? Hey!

130
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,980
Hey!

131
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,550
Ee-yow!

132
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:36,290
–Yow! Yow! Yow!
–Fight...

133
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,930
Fight.

134
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,000
Fight! Fight, Gohan! Fight!

135
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:54,740
Avenge your daddy's death!
Get up, Gohan! Fight, Gohan! Fight!

136
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,920
How about I at least let you
die next to your father? I'll be kind.

137
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,340
G-Gohan...

138
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,780
Oh? Kakarrot, you're a tough one.
You're still conscious, are you?

139
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,780
Gohan, can you hear me?

140
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:42,790
Gohan, your daddy's whole
body is a mess. I can't move anymore.

141
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:49,290
Fight in my place. His power
should have dropped considerably.

142
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:56,300
I-I can't, Father! He's
too strong! I can't beat him!

143
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,670
All right, I'll do it this way–
I'll follow my order, and kill Kakarrot first.

144
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,110
Next will be Kakarrot's kid.

145
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,980
After that, I'll finish off
that bald bastard from earlier.

146
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,820
Finally, I'll kill the bastard
who cut off my precious tail!

147
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,350
<i>He remembered me, huh?</i>

148
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,360
You don't have to beat him...
Just keep him bottled up...

149
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,360
Your power should be even
more incredible than his... even more...

150
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,900
While you're doing that,
I'll have Kuririn finish him off...

151
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,370
I can't! I can't even move anymore!

152
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:39,310
You stupid jackass! Do you want
everyone else's deaths to be in vain?

153
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,720
What did Piccolo teach you?

154
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,730
I'm counting on you, Gohan...

155
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:14,180
For left-behind scum, you're
sure giving me a lot of trouble!

156
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,120
G-Gohan!

157
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,930
What's the matter?! Eh?!

158
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,760
S-Stop... that...

159
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,000
Die!

160
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,030
Stop... that!

161
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,000
What's the matter? Die! Die!

162
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,540
Stop that!

163
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,570
What?!

164
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,380
I'm going...

165
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,910
...to defeat you!

166
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,110
<i>You</i> are going to defeat <i>me</i>?

167
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,760
What the...?!

168
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,900
Kuririn!

169
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,930
Kuririn, please! Come here!

170
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,950
D-Dammit...

171
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,380
Don't you mess around with Vegeta<i>-sama</i>!

172
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,290
G-Goku, it's hopeless. He's just too terrible.

173
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,390
Why didn't you tell Gohan to run away?

174
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,800
I'm going to give this to you now, Kuririn...

175
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,540
The <i>Genki Dama</i> that
I gathered from all over the Earth...

176
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:50,440
Eh? What did you say?
What are you going to give me?

177
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,110
A-A <i>Genki Dama... Ki</i> that I've
collected from everything on Earth...

178
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:01,920
About half of it got away, but I think
it will still defeat him, the way he is now...

179
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,120
W-What?

180
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,130
Kuririn... take my hand...

181
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,260
I don't understand this at all.

182
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,100
Hurry! Gohan is going to die!

183
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,300
I just have to take your hand?

184
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,700
Please...

185
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,870
Like this?

186
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,710
Your bones are broken, aren't they?

187
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,550
That's okay... Don't let go...

188
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,350
I'm giving it to you now, so take it...

189
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,120
W-W-What is this?

190
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,320
I-It's awesome... This is
a tremendous amount of <i>ki</i>!

191
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,730
Turn your palm upward, and focus it...
You can make it into a ball...

192
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,370
You dirty brat!

193
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,510
Hang in there...

194
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,320
Gohan ain't able to control this kind of <i>ki...</i>

195
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,720
I-It came out! Is this–?

196
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,130
A <i>Genki Dama...</i> You did it!

197
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,330
You're a pesky brat!

198
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:09,450
Kuririn... hit him with it...
I can't make another <i>Genki Dama...</i>

199
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:13,380
M-Make sure you hit him! Please!

200
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,920
U-Understood. I'll try.

201
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:26,930
<i>Will the Genki Dama that has been entrusted</i>
<i>to Kuririn be able to put a stop to Vegeta?</i>

202
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

203
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,530
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

204
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

205
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

206
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,880
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

207
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

208
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

209
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

210
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

211
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

212
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,570
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

213
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,640
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

214
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,310
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

215
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>So sorry.</i>

216
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,580
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

217
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

218
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,410
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

219
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,240
<i>Kuririn, we're counting on you.</i>

220
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,240
<i>That Genki Dama is filled</i>
<i>with the hopes of everyone.</i>

221
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,410
<i>It's no use! He's too fast!</i>
<i>I can't tell how he's going to move!</i>

222
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,520
<i>What're ya doin', ya dimwit?!</i>
<i>Hurry up and hit him!</i>

223
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,550
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

224
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:31,960
<i>"Shoot, Kuririn!</i>
<i>The Genki Dama, Packed with Hope."</i>

225
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,130
<i>Vegeta! Die already, would you?!</i>

226
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,260
"Next time"
"Shoot, Kuririn!
The <i>Genki Dama</i>, Packed with Hope"
