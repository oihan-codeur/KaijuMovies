<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:14,260
<i>Vegeta had been rendered</i>

17
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,040
You think that someone who can't beat
me is going to be able to beat Freeza<i>-sama</i>?!

18
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:46,620
Looks like you weren't able to
move, and now you've drowned.

19
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,960
<i>Elsewhere, with Dende leading him,</i>
<i>Kuririn headed toward the Grand Elder's home.</i>

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,060
Welcome.

21
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:08,810
<i>"Defend the Star of Hope!!</i>
<i>Kuririn's Astonishing Power-Up."</i>

22
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,410
C-Could he have fallen asleep?

23
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,250
I don't know...

24
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,620
U-Um...

25
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,760
Because of those villains, most of my
children across this world have been killed.

26
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,790
This is grievous.

27
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,770
They appear to be after the Dragon Balls.

28
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,570
Yes.

29
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,570
To think that this would happen
because of these Balls of hope,

30
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,580
testament to the wisdom
and power of the Namekians...

31
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,180
Excuse me for coming right to the point,
but could I ask you to let me borrow

32
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,990
the Dragon Ball over
your head for a short while?

33
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,420
I absolutely will not turn it
over to them! I promise you!

34
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,390
You are gathering the Dragon Balls too, are you?

35
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:39,400
Yes. We would like to bring
our dead friends back to life.

36
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,770
I ask on my behalf, as well.

37
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:45,600
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>, if these
people's friends come back to life,

38
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,310
they may be able to defeat those bad people.

39
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,880
How do you know of the Dragon Balls?

40
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,280
We had them on Earth as well.

41
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,910
What did you say?!

42
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,780
Long ago, during this planet's crisis,

43
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,950
there was a Namekian
who made his way to Earth.

44
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,340
That person created our Dragon Balls.

45
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,780
Is that so? I remember now.
Katattsu's child. What a surprise.

46
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,750
Who would have thought that
he would arrive safely on Earth?

47
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:37,790
That child was a Dragon-type prodigy,
who was capable of creating Dragon Balls.

48
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:45,800
He was killed along with our other
friends by the Saiyan Vegeta, who is now here.

49
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,940
The Saiyans are indeed terrible.
That child prodigy, huh?

50
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,940
This Saiyan wouldn't happen
to be a Super Saiyan, would he?

51
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,940
Huh? W-What's that?

52
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:04,180
Gentleman from Earth,
could I get you to come over here?

53
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,090
Please allow me to
probe into your past a little.

54
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:14,990
Past?

55
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,630
How can this be?! Once evil made
its way inside him, he split into two?!

56
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,950
So in order for him to become Kami,

57
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,560
he couldn't have even the slightest
of evil feelings within him, then?

58
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,760
And as a result, the evil Piccolo was born.

59
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,560
But what a shame.

60
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,900
To think that he should divide the
uncanny power he was born with in half.

61
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:33,570
If he had become one, as he was
before, he may not have had to die.

62
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,310
Become one?

63
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,310
Well, I guess it would be all right.
Your desires are pure,

64
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,750
and the courage you have
displayed up to now is greatly esteemed.

65
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,750
I will give this Dragon Ball to you.

66
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,990
Terrific!

67
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,290
Thank you very much.

68
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,630
So this is a Dragon Ball from
the homeland. It sure is huge.

69
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,940
Things sure are slow, huh?

70
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,680
Is someone here?!

71
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:16,280
No, I'm bored, so I thought
I would do some training.

72
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,720
Oh...

73
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
Six more to go, huh? I'll do my best.

74
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,290
Still, I doubt you will have your wish granted.

75
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:28,290
Huh? Why not?

76
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,140
Unfortunately, my life will
only hold out for another few days.

77
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,170
Can you get the Balls that those
bad men have already gathered

78
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:41,170
away from them before then?

79
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,020
I would think that would
be impossible. Once I die...

80
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,220
...the Dragon Balls will also expire.

81
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,390
It's okay! That can't be helped!

82
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,860
For the time being, I will
guard this Ball with my life.

83
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:07,870
That's far better than allowing
those guys to gain eternal life, after all.

84
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,670
If you'd be so kind. I cannot guard
it anymore with the power I have left.

85
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,470
I will, for sure!

86
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,080
You have such outstanding power.

87
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,310
It's such a waste that you
still have power lying dormant.

88
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,150
Power lying dormant?

89
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,130
I will awaken that power for you.

90
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,060
I couldn't possibly have any power left.

91
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,730
I've thoroughly trained myself, after all.

92
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,930
I'm beyond my limits now as it is.

93
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,990
Please escape from their clutches somehow.

94
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,220
My power... my power...

95
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,600
My power has shot up! This is awesome!

96
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:20,540
I-I don't believe it!
It feels like I've been reborn!

97
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,570
Thank you so much!

98
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
Um...

99
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,650
Can you call forth anyone's power?
Say, even a little kid's?

100
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,750
As long as there is dormant power within them,

101
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,090
it is possible, whomever they may be.

102
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,290
I-It won't shorten your life
if you do it too much, will it?

103
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,830
All I do is provide the occasion.
It has nothing to do with my life.

104
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:50,840
C-Could I bring another one of my friends here?

105
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,070
I am positive that he has an
incredible amount of power lying dormant.

106
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:00,180
Bring him here. The more
strong just men we have, the better.

107
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,620
Right! I'll go bring him right now!

108
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,620
U-Uh... as for this...

109
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,290
Please take it with you.

110
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:13,960
I am leaving the future of
this world and the universe to you.

111
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,270
Dende, wait here. I'll go get
Gohan and bring him right back here.

112
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:25,000
P-Please be careful.

113
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,170
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

114
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,310
This is awesome! I can't believe
I had this kind of power within me!

115
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,750
I should be able to pick up
Gohan in a few hours like this!

116
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
H-How can this be?!

117
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,260
A village we haven't attacked
yet has been exterminated!

118
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:18,980
If I submerge the Dragon Ball here,
no one will be able to find it.

119
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,160
<i>Whatever it takes,</i>
<i>I have to get that Dragon Ball...</i>

120
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,130
What happened? Who overcame you?

121
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,970
A S-Saiyan... came for the Dragon Ball...

122
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,000
So it <i>was</i> Vegeta, was it?

123
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,440
T-The Dragon–

124
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,640
Know when it's time to die!

125
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,530
It couldn't be...

126
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,330
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, it is Zarbon.

127
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,170
Come in.

128
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,040
Has a village been located?

129
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:22,180
No, we have not discovered
any villages at this time,

130
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,550
but I have just come from defeating Vegeta.

131
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,320
Oh, is that so? Then Zarbon<i>-san,</i>

132
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,320
that means you transformed
for the first time in ages, yes?

133
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,320
Yes, sir.

134
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,730
So, Vegeta did die, then?

135
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,330
Well, I did not exactly check for a body,

136
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,370
but even in the unlikely event that he
did survive, he must be gravely injured.

137
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,710
Why did you not verify that he was dead?

138
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,710
W-Well, Vegeta had been
submerged underwater, so...

139
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,710
You could have dove into the water, no?

140
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,150
You were loathe to get yourself wet,
and neglected to check for his corpse.

141
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,160
And trying to kill him right away
was a rash thing to do in the first place.

142
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,690
What are we to do if Vegeta has
hidden a Dragon Ball from us somewhere?

143
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,100
I-I am terribly sorry!
I will go check on him at once!

144
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,700
Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

145
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,100
I have–I have discovered a village!

146
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,270
What?

147
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,710
However, the village
had already been destroyed.

148
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,280
What was that?!

149
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,350
I am afraid it was the work of Vegeta.

150
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,180
Then he <i>has</i> hidden a Dragon Ball somewhere!

151
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,590
There was one surviving villager,
but I disposed of him immediately.

152
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,120
You killed him, then? The only witness we had?

153
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
Y-Yes, sir...

154
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,070
The thing I hate most is when rash actions
are taken when there is insufficient data.

155
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:56,070
Be prepared to answer to
me as well if Vegeta is dead.

156
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,480
Bring Vegeta here at once.

157
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,080
This time, place your hopes on
the chance that he is still alive.

158
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,080
–Yes, sir!
–Appule!

159
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,050
Yes, sir?

160
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,290
You will contact Planet Freeza

161
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,730
and inform the Ginyu Special Corps
that they are to come here.

162
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:18,730
And of course, tell them
to bring Scouters with them.

163
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,300
They should arrive in five days.

164
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,170
Understood.

165
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,310
F-Freeza<i>-sama</i>, why the Ginyu Special Corps?

166
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:29,310
Forgive me for saying so,

167
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,680
but I believe it is completely
unnecessary to call that group here.

168
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,120
I feel an odd foreboding.

169
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,120
H-How do you mean, foreboding?

170
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,690
I have been thinking
this for a little while now,

171
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,690
but it would seem that there is
a powerful Saiyan being brought up,

172
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,660
and in time, I feel he will become my foe.

173
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,270
At first, I thought it was Vegeta,
but it does not appear to be.

174
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,100
A-Are you sure you are
not making too much of it?

175
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:04,280
Aside from Vegeta, there is only
what's-his-name and his child, on Earth.

176
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,680
Their battle power is supposed to
be considerably lower than Vegeta's.

177
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,120
Are you telling me that my foreboding is wrong?

178
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,290
N-No, sir.

179
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:18,020
Never mind that, I would like
you to hurry and bring Vegeta here.

180
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,220
Y-Yes, sir!

181
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,330
<i>The Ginyu Special Corps...</i>

182
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,300
<i>The Saiyans do indeed</i>

183
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,310
<i>appear to have a fathomless</i>
<i>battle power ensconced within them.</i>

184
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,710
<i>Every time they do battle, it rises greatly.</i>

185
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,280
<i>Naturally, there is no way</i>
<i>that it can stand against me,</i>

186
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,520
<i>but when considering the future,</i>
<i>I must nip it in the bud now.</i>

187
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,360
<i>It would be problematic if one were</i>
<i>to become a "super" Saiyan, after all.</i>

188
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,120
That was some good sleep.
I wonder how long I've been asleep.

189
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,290
It's no use! I'm so exhausted,
I can't move at all!

190
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,930
D-Damn it!

191
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:43,740
I-I am... not... about... to die!

192
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,460
W-What? To think that he'd
still be alive. He's one tough guy.

193
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,460
Then again, it's because of that
that <i>I'll</i> be spared this time around.

194
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,470
We're going to treat you. You're one lucky guy.

195
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,410
Hey, listen, Gohan<i>-kun,</i>

196
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,010
look at this.

197
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,450
One of the Dragon Balls has started moving.

198
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,020
It's coming straight this way.

199
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,090
Could that be Kuririn<i>-kun</i>?

200
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:38,300
I'm sure it is! He did it!

201
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,300
He must have met the
Grand Elder, and gotten his Ball.

202
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,510
J-Just a moment. Then, what
exactly is this other one here?

203
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,450
These five here are probably
the ones that Freeza guy has, right?

204
00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,620
But look, there's this
one over here all by itself.

205
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,530
Huh? You're right, and it's close to here.

206
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,900
Let's see... that direction, right?

207
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,710
Ah! We told you that Vegeta
was attacking a village, remember?

208
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,540
It was in that direction!

209
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,380
B-But Vegeta isn't over there.

210
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:34,390
I can't sense his <i>ki.</i>

211
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,570
I've got it! He attacked the village,
but was unable to find the Dragon Ball!

212
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,940
He figured it wasn't there,
and went off somewhere else.

213
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:56,410
Please let me borrow that Radar!
I'm going to go get that Dragon Ball.

214
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,480
All right! Luck is turning
in our favor somewhat!

215
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,300
Good, good, now's our chance!

216
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:21,330
I don't sense any formidable <i>ki</i> nearby at all!

217
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,770
Who would have thought we'd ever
be treating the injuries of a traitor?

218
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,090
<i>The scramble for the Dragon Balls</i>
<i>was becoming more and more chaotic.</i>

219
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:25,330
<i>Who will be the one that laughs last?</i>

220
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

221
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

222
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

223
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

224
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

225

227

<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

228
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,600
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

229
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,700
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

230
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

231
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,540
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

232
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

233
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

234
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,520
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

235
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,530
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

236
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,570
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

237
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,170
<i>I'll bet Yamucha and the others</i>
<i>are training at Kaio-sama's place.</i>

238
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:19,180
<i>I wonder if it's the same</i>
<i>training I got when I was there.</i>

239
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,110
<i>Do whatever it takes to revive Vegeta.</i>

240
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,580
<i>Otherwise, I forfeit my life to Freeza-sama.</i>
