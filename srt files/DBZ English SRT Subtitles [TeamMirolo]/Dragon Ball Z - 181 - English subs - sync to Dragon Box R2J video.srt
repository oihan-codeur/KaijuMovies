<i>Their high-level battle continued on.</i>

19
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:56,245
Your attack was good enough that it
caused me to have to raise a barrier.

20
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,915
I took on more damage than I expected.

21
00:03:02,455 --> 00:03:05,425
I give up! I surrender!

22
00:03:05,465 --> 00:03:07,005
<i>W-W-What was that?!</i>

26
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:51,045
U-Unbelievable!

27
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,805
Surrender?

28
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:06,195
Son Goku, are you
thinking of ending this fight?!

29
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,565
That's right. I lose.

30
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:15,495
W-What did that young man say?

31
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:19,375
Over the long-range mike,
he clearly said he surrenders.

32
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:21,375
Well, he hung in there pretty well.

33
00:04:21,415 --> 00:04:25,375
That's probably all that young man could do.

34
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,375
You're so right, Mister Satan!

35
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:30,505
After all, if it were anyone else but you...

36
00:04:31,885 --> 00:04:37,385
Son Goku! Do you realize
what those words mean?

37
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:38,385
Yeah.

38
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:41,015
If there is no one left to
fight in these Cell Games,

39
00:04:41,055 --> 00:04:46,395
then every last human on Earth
will be wiped out by my hand!

40
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:49,235
Cell, don't get me wrong.

41
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:53,115
It's not as though there
ain't anyone left to fight, right?

42
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:55,115
It's the same difference.

43
00:04:59,155 --> 00:05:04,585
Vegeta, Piccolo and Trunks
all have to be inferior to you,

44
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:07,455
no matter how much
they've raised their powers.

45
00:05:07,495 --> 00:05:09,795
They are no match for me.

46
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:20,055
So, Mister Satan, your
turn has come around again!

47
00:05:23,015 --> 00:05:24,765
You've had plenty of time to rest, and all.

48
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:28,815
This time, please be sure
to take care of him for good!

49
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:31,445
Satan-<i>sama</i>, may you have a magnificent fight!

50
00:05:31,485 --> 00:05:33,945
Yes indeed, Master!

51
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:41,155
R-Right! Why don't I go on
over and make him quake?

52
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,165
M-M-Mister Satan...?

53
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:52,335
Satan-<i>sama</i>, what's the matter?

54
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:55,175
Ee-yow-ow-ow-ow!

55
00:05:55,215 --> 00:05:57,255
H-Here I want to go fight,

56
00:05:57,295 --> 00:06:01,805
and there's no way I would lose to that guy...!

57
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:06,815
B-B-But with my stomach like this...!

58
00:06:06,855 --> 00:06:09,435
Please do not worry, Satan-<i>sama</i>!

59
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:12,445
This is a fast-acting medicine for stomachaches!

60
00:06:12,485 --> 00:06:14,025
Just swallow one capsule,

61
00:06:14,065 --> 00:06:17,985
and your stomachache will recover on the spot!

62
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:21,365
You fool! I don't need that!

63
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:27,455
What a shame! If only I didn't
get these stomachache spells...!

64
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:30,745
And here I wanted to send that bastard flying...!

65
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:43,385
Well, would it be okay if
I called on the next person to fight?

66
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:46,855
You really intend to give up?

67
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,855
<i>W-What does he think he's doing?!</i>

68
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:52,185
<i>There's no one else who can beat Cell here!</i>

69
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:58,365
The Cell Games will probably
end after the next person fights.

70
00:06:58,405 --> 00:07:02,235
If he loses, then there ain't
anyone else around who can beat you!

71
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:19,885
But I'm now absolutely
convinced that he will defeat you.

72
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:21,055
What?

73
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:25,385
That's why I've surrendered,
and left everything up to him.

74
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:32,025
Which means that he's stronger
than you are, not to mention myself?

75
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:32,815
Yep.

76
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:36,235
Ridiculous!

77
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:40,865
There is no one stronger
than me in the whole world.

78
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:43,405
Yes, there is.

79
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:48,785
Well then, let's hear the name of
this person who couldn't possibly exist!

80
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:20,815
He's about to say the name.

81
00:08:20,855 --> 00:08:22,315
A-All right...

82
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:30,325
<i>He's planning to say "Mister Satan."</i>

83
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,455
H-Hey...

84
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:40,125
Go tell him for me that my
stomach hurts, and I cannot fight.

85
00:08:51,345 --> 00:08:54,685
It's your turn, Gohan!

86
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,065
What?!

87
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:07,825
That idiot! Is he trying to get his
own son killed right before his eyes?!

88
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:29,845
G-Goku-<i>sa</i>! What are you thinkin'?!

89
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,385
Son-in-law!

90
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:36,015
G-Goku-<i>sa</i> is goin' to make Gohan-<i>chan...</i>
Gohan-<i>chan</i> face that terrible opponent!

91
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:41,525
–What is he thinkin'?! Gohan! Gohan! Gohan!
–Calm down, Chichi!

92
00:09:42,445 --> 00:09:46,155
H-He said it was time for "<i>gohan."</i>
[<i>gohan</i>: a meal]

93
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:49,865
So that's it!

94
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:51,405
He's saying he's going to take a short break,

95
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:53,745
and have a <i>bento</i> lunch or something, huh?

96
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:56,745
They sure are happy-go-lucky at a time like this.

97
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:05,385
You can do it, Gohan.

98
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:09,215
M-Me, and Cell?

99
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,675
He's jerking me around!

100
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:15,355
Of all the people he could have
named, he went with Son Gohan?!

101
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:19,355
Don't be crazy, Son!
There's no way he can fight!

102
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:23,355
It's true, Gohan's strengths have risen
to the point where I hardly recognize him,

103
00:10:23,395 --> 00:10:27,195
but he'd be facing Cell, an opponent
not even you could stand against!

104
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:34,205
Piccolo, Gohan has an unbelievable
power, even greater than you or I thought.

105
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:37,085
Think about it.

106
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,245
Ain't it true that from
the time he was a little kid,

107
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:42,085
he's been fighting just like the rest of us?

108
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:50,265
When I was a kid his age,
I wasn't anything special.

109
00:10:50,305 --> 00:10:54,635
B-But still, even though
he may be a Super Saiyan,

110
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:59,105
this is a little sudden, right?

111
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:02,945
Inside the Room of Spirit and Time,
there was a dormant power,

112
00:11:02,985 --> 00:11:06,855
sealed deep, deep down within
him, that started to be released.

113
00:11:11,825 --> 00:11:13,155
How about it, Gohan?

114
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:16,325
After watching the fight
between your dad and Cell just now,

115
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:19,165
did you think it was too
incredible for you to keep up with?

116
00:11:21,835 --> 00:11:25,005
N-No, I didn't think so.

117
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:29,715
But then, Father, neither you
nor Cell was fighting all-out, right?

118
00:11:32,385 --> 00:11:36,515
I don't know about Cell,
but your dad was fighting all-out.

119
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:40,015
In other words,

120
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:43,225
to you, it felt like I must
have been holding back, right?

121
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,155
I-Is that true, Gohan?

122
00:11:51,195 --> 00:11:52,825
Yes.

123
00:11:54,365 --> 00:12:01,535
<i>W-What?! That fight?!</i>
<i>Impossible! A kid like him...?!</i>

124
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:07,505
What nonsense.

125
00:12:09,505 --> 00:12:15,675
Okay, let him have it, Gohan.
Bring peace back to the world.

126
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:18,225
You wanted to be a scholar, right?

127
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:27,895
Understood! I'll give it a try!

128
00:12:36,075 --> 00:12:37,535
Gohan...

129
00:12:40,915 --> 00:12:43,085
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

130
00:13:31,085 --> 00:13:32,885
How absurd.

131
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:36,425
What in the world could be happening now?

132
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,635
They said it was time for "<i>gohan,"</i>

133
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:41,435
and yet another unnamed
boy has come forward!

134
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:46,015
I know! That boy sells <i>bento</i> lunches!

135
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:55,615
So that's it! Since it's time for "<i>gohan,"</i>

136
00:13:55,655 --> 00:13:58,325
that's the reason a <i>bento</i>
salesboy has come forward.

137
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:02,825
He sells <i>bento</i> lunches!
A <i>bento</i> salesboy has emerged!

138
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:06,835
Oh? Now it's Chichi-<i>san</i>'s kid.

139
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,835
They said he's got a job sellin' <i>bento</i> lunches.

140
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,005
And he was workin' so hard to be a scholar, too.

141
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:16,005
Now he's dyein' his hair color.

142
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:18,465
He's gone and become a delinquent.

143
00:14:18,505 --> 00:14:20,635
Must be hard on poor Chichi-<i>san,</i>

144
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:24,015
havin' both her husband
and her son go bad like that.

145
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:25,805
Definitely.

146
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:31,815
G-Gohan?

147
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:37,405
Hmm, no matter what happens,
I doubt that Gohan can compete with Cell.

148
00:14:39,485 --> 00:14:41,995
Kuririn, you've got the <i>senzu</i> beans, right?

149
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:44,155
Could you give me one?

150
00:14:45,495 --> 00:14:47,075
Yeah.

151
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,375
Ah, thank you.

152
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,415
Cell!

153
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:05,475
That there's a <i>senzu</i>. Eat it.

154
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:09,855
Y-You idiot, Goku! What are you trying to do?!

155
00:15:09,895 --> 00:15:14,065
It's all right, ain't it?
He has used up his strength.

156
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:17,405
It ain't fair to let Gohan beat him like this.

157
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:19,695
W-What are you talking about?!

158
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:22,735
Since when was there any of
this "fair" crap in this situation?!

159
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,035
You miserable fool!

160
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,415
You're trying to play it up too much.

161
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:33,255
You don't seem to understand that
such indulgence will cost you your life.

162
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:39,885
I will not hesitate to accept this <i>senzu.</i>

163
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:45,135
Son Goku! You will come to
utterly regret this very soon.

164
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:02,445
D-Damn...!

165
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:12,415
I see. Those are nice, aren't they?

166
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:16,415
W-Whatever happens now, it's not on me!

167
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:21,795
Son! No matter how you look at it,
what you just did was reckless!

168
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:58,835
W-What's the deal with that boy?!

169
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,465
It doesn't look like he's selling <i>bento</i> lunches!

170
00:17:07,885 --> 00:17:12,145
Is that... Gohan's <i>ki</i>?

171
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:17,685
It just might be possible
that Gohan has surpassed Goku.

172
00:17:24,485 --> 00:17:26,695
Gohan...!

173
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:16,875
Th-That's Gohan?! Our gentle little Gohan?!

174
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:25,045
Th-That kid...? How did he
get that much battle power...?!

175
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:30,885
It appears that Son Goku was
not entirely bluffing in what he said.

176
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:33,825
However, the part about
you being able to beat me

177
00:18:33,865 --> 00:18:36,395
would appear to be an overstatement.

178
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:52,035
You impudent brat!

179
00:18:52,075 --> 00:18:54,205
You really mean to go at it, do you?

180
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:56,575
But then, this might turn
out to be fortunate for you.

181
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:01,585
You'll be dead before you ever
experience true terror, after all.

182
00:19:29,485 --> 00:19:31,445
Attaboy, Gohan!

183
00:19:38,495 --> 00:19:41,455
G-Gohan...!

184
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,465
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

185
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:45,505
The boy, whom we thought
was selling <i>bento</i> lunches,

186
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:48,465
has suddenly begun to fight!

187
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:51,095
He appears to be hanging in there quite well.

188
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:53,265
However, he is up against Cell.

189
00:19:53,305 --> 00:19:56,175
Will he be able to last
longer than one minute?

190
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:19,785
You're a nimble little runt.

191
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:22,995
Now then, let me increase
my speed like I really mean it!

192
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:40,805
Sure enough, this was reckless.

193
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:42,855
G-Goku...!

194
00:20:55,275 --> 00:21:00,365
G-Gohan! Gohan-<i>chan</i>! Stop that! Stop that!

195
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:18,765
Goku-<i>san</i>!

196
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:21,595
Hey, Goku! Hey!

197
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:23,995
<i>Gohan, having accepted</i>
<i>Goku's call, now faces the Cell Games.</i>

198
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:29,955
<i>Goku, are you saying that</i>
<i>Gohan can really beat Cell?</i>

199
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:48,725
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

200
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:54,565
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

201
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,945
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

202
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

203
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:11,915
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

204
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:16,045
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

205
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:19,555
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

206
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:22,175
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

207
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:29,685
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

208
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:33,775
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

209
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,605
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

210
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

211
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

212
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

213
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,585
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

214
00:23:55,335 --> 00:24:00,635
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

215
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:14,395
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

216
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:18,105
<i>Get angry, Gohan! If we're going</i>
<i>to defeat Cell, all we can do now</i>

217
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:20,115
<i>is count on the power you</i>
<i>release when you're angry!</i>

218
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:22,075
<i>Look how wrong you were, Son Goku!</i>

219
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:27,745
<i>Thanks to your misdirected</i>
<i>thinking, your dear son will die!</i>

220
00:24:27,785 --> 00:24:29,915
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

221
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:33,415
<i>"Become Enraged Gohan –</i>
<i>Call Forth Your Dormant Power."</i>

222
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:36,085
<i>I really don't want to fight.</i>

223
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:38,255
"Next time"
"Become Enraged Gohan–
Call Forth Your Dormant Power"
