00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,075
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,255
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,805 --> 00:01:04,775
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12

<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

15
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:43,035
Farewell, Ten<i>-san.</i> Please don't die.

17
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:46,775
Stop! Chaozu!

18
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:51,875
<i>The Saiyans were so formidable</i>
<i>that not even Chaozu giving his life</i>

19
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:53,945

20
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:57,385
<i>Has Goku, who had finished his</i>

21
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:59,915
<i>Hurry, Goku!</i>

22
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:11,835
<i>"Tenshinhan Cries Out!!</i>
<i>This is My Final Kikoho."</i>

24
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:53,535
Ch-Chaozu...

25
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,905
Who's going to play with me next?

26
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:02,945
I-It had no effect at all!

27
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:06,175
Chaozu won't be able
to rest in peace like this!

28
00:05:06,215 --> 00:05:08,745
Looks like his death was for nothing.

29
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,325
Chaozu!

30
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:29,105
Be grateful! I'm going to send you to meet
him again in the Next World soon enough!

31
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:36,045
Y-You'll pay for this!

32
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,985
You're definitely going to pay for this!

33
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:50,395
Incredible!

34
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:52,335
You can't be too careful getting near him!

35
00:06:30,075 --> 00:06:33,635
Tenshinhan! Get him back
for Yamucha and Chaozu!

36
00:06:33,675 --> 00:06:35,975
Hang in there, Tenshinhan!

37
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:42,175
The only thing driving
Tenshinhan is his determination.

38
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:44,345
He's fighting on determination alone.

39
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:52,415
More trouble with this?
What on earth is the problem?!

40
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:09,605
Hey! Can't you get any closer?!

41
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,445
T-This is intense!

42
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:23,955
Out of breath already? You
should start seeing the Next World soon.

43
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:36,195
At this rate, Tenshinhan<i>-san</i>
will be done in, too.

44
00:07:36,235 --> 00:07:38,435
I've got to do something!

45
00:07:38,475 --> 00:07:41,035
Stop!

46
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:44,605
We've got a slight, momentary
opening on him when he moves to attack.

47
00:07:44,645 --> 00:07:46,375
We'll watch for that moment.

48
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:56,385
Got that, Gohan?

49
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,955
Yes...

50
00:07:57,995 --> 00:08:00,225
That's a good strategy.

51
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:02,885
I hope it goes well for you.

52
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:10,265
Are you sure you should be
looking away? You'll miss your chance.

53
00:08:10,305 --> 00:08:15,065
You sure are confident.
But you won't be able to stand there

54
00:08:15,105 --> 00:08:17,035
with that stupid look on
your face once Son Goku arrives.

55
00:08:17,075 --> 00:08:22,605
Oh? And who is that? Your ace-in-the-hole?

56
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:26,145
You just look forward to it.

57
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,125
Tenshinhan<i>-san</i>!

58
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:51,935
Looks like this is
the end of the line for you.

59
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:54,705
I'll put you out of your misery right now.

60
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:07,155
See you in hell!

61
00:09:10,065 --> 00:09:12,625
Now! Scatter, Kuririn, Gohan!

62
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:13,655
Yeah!

63
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:18,665
You're finished! Die!

64
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,405
What?!

65
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:30,985
Gohan! Now! Shoot him!

66
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:37,615
Gohan!

67
00:09:37,655 --> 00:09:39,385
Take aim!

68
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,225
I'm scared!

69
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,545
You dirty brat!

70
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:02,105
No!

71
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:20,295
We missed him! Our timing was too late!

72
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:28,775
I-I'm sorry... Uncle Piccolo!

73
00:10:31,315 --> 00:10:37,945
You really did a number on me.
You've shortened your lives even further.

74
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:42,545
Fine! I've decided to change the
order in which I'm going to kill you.

75
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,455
Brace yourselves!

76
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:51,255
What the matter, Kami<i>-sama</i>?

77
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:54,695
It looks like my life
will only last a little longer.

78
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:58,435
Death... death is close at hand.

79
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:02,535
Which means... don't tell me!

80
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:04,935
Piccolo is going to be killed.

81
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:07,245
And so will everyone else.

82
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,545
W-What about Goku?

83
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:14,545
I still cannot sense his presence.

84
00:11:14,585 --> 00:11:18,425
Goku, hurry! Hurry, Goku!

85
00:11:27,435 --> 00:11:29,565
That was some awesome speed <i>oni</i>!

86
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,475
Hang in there <i>oni</i>!

87
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:42,475
<i>Guys, sit tight!</i>

88
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:09,795
Ch-Chaozu...

89
00:12:11,575 --> 00:12:15,375
You guys aren't too
bright to be making me angry.

90
00:12:15,415 --> 00:12:18,715
I'll get you two together!

91
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,085
What do we do?

92
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,865
That brat!

93
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:33,965
Well now, which one will
I amuse myself with first?

94
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:39,695
I'll leave the Namekian
there alive, but barely breathing.

95
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:44,535
We have to find out more
about the Dragon Balls from you.

96
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:46,845
You're lucky, Piccolo.

97
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:50,315
They think that you're the only
one who knows about the Dragon Balls.

98
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:54,615
It's all the same. They're
planning to kill us all, in any case.

99
00:12:55,755 --> 00:13:00,055
All right, we go on the offensive first!
We're going to attack him!

100
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:33,755
Crafty...

101
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:35,225
Here goes!

102
00:14:15,005 --> 00:14:16,865
Uncle!

103
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,575
Uncle...

104
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:29,205
We don't need any cowards like you.
Go on home to bed, right now!

105
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:43,985
Tenshinhan<i>-san</i>! Are you dead?

106
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:49,495
Piccolo, now what?
Is there anything we can do?

107
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:50,795
No.

108
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:56,035
I didn't think he was
going to be this big a monster.

109
00:14:56,075 --> 00:15:00,635
He goes far beyond
the Saiyan that came earlier.

110
00:15:01,415 --> 00:15:04,775
It's too late for regrets to do any good now!

111
00:15:04,815 --> 00:15:06,585
Here I come!

112
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:35,245
Tenshinhan<i>-san</i>!

113
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:38,975
Ch-Chaozu...

114
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:42,215
Ten<i>-san...</i>

115
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:44,555
Chaozu!

116
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:48,225
Ten<i>-san</i>, I'm sorry. I didn't do any good.

117
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,955
Chaozu...

118
00:15:59,975 --> 00:16:02,105
Tenshinhan<i>-san...</i>

119
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:44,675
Ten<i>-san</i>, I'm sorry...

120
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:52,415
Chaozu!

121
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:07,965
Chaozu, I will avenge you!
And then I'll be coming.

122
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:10,775
I won't let you be lonesome all by yourself!

123
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:28,055
This... this will be my final...

124
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:34,625
<i>...Kikoho!</i>

125
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:51,875
Did he get him?!

126
00:18:12,005 --> 00:18:14,705
You gave me a start...

127
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:17,375
It didn't work at all against him!

128
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:19,775
Don't tell me he's immortal!

129
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:25,855
N-No!

130
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,865
Miserable fool! He could have just lain there,

131
00:18:40,905 --> 00:18:43,365
but he instead used up his
power and died for nothing.

132
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:46,935
I-It can't be! Not Tenshinhan too!

133
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:52,465
This is awful. It's a nightmare. How
can everyone be dying, one after another?

134
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:58,945
Goku! Get here soon!

135
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:02,945
Goku! Goku!

136
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:08,585
Please! Goku!

137
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,115
Goku?

138
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:15,195
They've been saying that for a while.

139
00:19:15,235 --> 00:19:16,465
Hang on...

140
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:22,935
Another one has been taken
care of! Your turn comes next!

141
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,935
Let's go down on the ground and fight.

142
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:27,505
He's far more used
to mid-air fighting than us.

143
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:33,945
It'll all end up the same,
no matter where it happens.

144
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:35,855
Writhe! Writhe!

145
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:39,955
Here goes!

146
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,325
–H-He's coming!
–Father!

147
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:45,695
Wait, Nappa!

148
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:52,265
W-What is it? Why
don't you let me get them?

149
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:55,905
Don't be hasty. There's
something I want to ask them.

150
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,305
This Son Goku person you're
talking about is Kakarrot, isn't it?

151
00:19:59,345 --> 00:20:01,675
That's right. What of it?

152
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:08,845
To think that you are
falling back on Kakarrot...

153
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:12,355
He couldn't even stand against Raditz.

154
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:14,525
What good will it do
you when he gets here?

155
00:20:14,565 --> 00:20:18,855
He won't be the same as he was back then!
He's sure to be much, much stronger!

156
00:20:18,895 --> 00:20:22,195
Don't you look down your noses at Son Goku!

157
00:20:24,735 --> 00:20:28,205
But for all that, he's not here, is he?!

158
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:30,705
Are you sure he hasn't
gotten scared and run away?!

159
00:20:30,745 --> 00:20:34,705
H-He'll be here! Father will surely be here!

160
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:37,045
He's going to take care of you guys!

161
00:20:37,085 --> 00:20:39,875
That reliance of yours is something else.

162
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:43,315
Interesting. We're going
to wait until he gets here.

163
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:47,625
Ah, that's lame! Let's put
these guys away right now!

164
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:49,525
However, only for three hours.

165
00:20:49,565 --> 00:20:51,555
We won't wait any longer than that.

166
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,705
That's absurd! I'm going
to play with them right now!

167
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,065
Nappa! Didn't you hear what I said?!

168
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:05,875
S-Sorry. I got carried away.

169
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:10,545
That's how it's going to be. Your lives
have been extended somewhat. Be grateful.

170
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:23,355
Be reasonable. This is his
first actual fight, after all.

171
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:28,525
I'm the pathetic one for
expecting anything from you.

172
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:30,125
Get out of here, you coward!

173
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:37,375
<i>Be that as it may, the way</i>
<i>that huge guy just got timid–</i>

174
00:21:37,415 --> 00:21:42,545
<i>does that mean that Vegeta runt over</i>
<i>there is even more ridiculously strong?</i>

175
00:21:42,585 --> 00:21:44,645
<i>How can that be?</i>

176
00:21:48,755 --> 00:21:52,885
I'm just itching to do something here!
Let's get them, right now!

177
00:21:52,925 --> 00:21:58,055
Just wait. Three more hours.
Wait three more hours,

178
00:21:58,095 --> 00:22:00,765
and you'll be able to watch
a magnificent, hellish show.

179
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:06,295
<i>Vegeta's scheme is appalling.</i>

180
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:10,245
<i>What exactly will this</i>
<i>hellish show in three hours be?</i>

181
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:15,145
<i>Is he saying that the extinction</i>
<i>of Earth will happen in three hours?</i>

182
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:19,415
<i>Will Goku arrive in time?</i>

183
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:46,605
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

184
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:52,475
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

185
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,855
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

186
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:03,355
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

187
00:23:05,665 --> 00:23:09,825
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

188
00:23:09,865 --> 00:23:13,935
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

189
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,435
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

190
00:23:17,475 --> 00:23:20,075
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

191
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:27,585
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

192
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,685
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

193
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:33,485
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

194
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:37,555
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

195
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:43,225
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

196
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:45,395
<i>So sorry.</i>

197
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:50,535
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

198
00:23:53,245 --> 00:23:58,515
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

199
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,855
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

200
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:16,065
<i>Lousy Saiyan, go on a wild spree, will you?!</i>

201
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,595
<i>Scream! Suffer!</i>

202
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:21,605
<i>As if that cowardly</i>
<i>Kakarrot is going to show up!</i>

203
00:24:21,645 --> 00:24:23,405
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

204

<i>"An Intense Three-Hour Delay!</i>

205
