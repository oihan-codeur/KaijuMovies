Yamucha<i>-san</i>, you have a telephone call.

00:05:50,985 --> 00:05:52,945
Y-You don't have to get so angry.

Really, this ain't funny!

54

How can you do this to us?

What part of Umigame's birthday are
you calling the emergency situation?!

57
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:14,635
W-Well, given he's turning
1,000, we can't just let it go.

58
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:18,235
And well, I forgot all
about it until this morning,

59
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:20,615
so getting ready for it has been a real struggle.

60
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:27,585
Oh, everyone,

61
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,655
I'm so touched that you
would trouble yourselves...

62
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:33,585
...to gather together here today on my behalf...

63
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:39,125
...I am so truly blessed
to have such good friends!

This is a bit hot, isn't it?

66
00:06:59,985 --> 00:07:02,145
Thank you very much!

00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:31,115
H-Hi...!

72
00:07:32,255 --> 00:07:33,585
Why, you...

73
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,585
Why are you all here?

74
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,425
What a big cake!

75
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:46,095
Oh, no! It's still much too
early to be giving us cake!

76
00:07:46,135 --> 00:07:48,505
And how did you know?

77
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:56,265
You don't mean, you
two are... getting married?

78
00:07:56,305 --> 00:07:58,775
Nah, we haven't formalized anything yet,

79
00:07:58,815 --> 00:08:02,945
but Maron<i>-chan</i> keeps saying these things...

80
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,615
Way to go, Kuririn!

81
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,615
How nice for you!

82
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,285
Well, didn't we do nicely for ourselves?

83
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:16,925
I hope you turn out as
good a bride as I have.

84
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:18,795
This won't do, Kuririn!

85
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:22,265
As your master, I have
not yet given my permission!

86
00:08:22,305 --> 00:08:25,265
Y-You mean...

87
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:29,265
I see no other choice.
If you want my permission...

88
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:32,645
I'll need one round of
<i>pafu-pafu</i> with Maron<i>-chan</i>!

89
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,755
Turtle<i>-chan</i>, how cute!

90
00:09:00,345 --> 00:09:04,305
Maron<i>-chan</i>, I wonder,
can I make you truly happy?

91
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:08,785
Why don't you give her the
Mermaid's Tear as a present?

92
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:12,345
For some reason, I couldn't sleep.

93
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,585
Please forgive me,
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

94
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:22,925
No, it's okay. So, what's this
Mermaid's Tear you mentioned?

95
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:29,365
It's a legendary giant pearl, said to
be at the bottom of the sea around here.

96
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:34,735
Legend has it that whoever is given this pearl,

97
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:40,245
by one who loves them, is sure to be happy.

98
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:42,875
Sure to be happy, huh?

99
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,115
All right!

100
00:09:54,295 --> 00:09:59,595
I will find this Mermaid's Tear,
and present it to Maron<i>-chan</i>!

101
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:04,665
By doing so, I'm sure I'll be
able to propose to her properly!

Oh, they sure are fine, those lively young girls!

106
00:11:15,305 --> 00:11:20,645
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>, they're your favorites,
same as they've always been, huh?

107
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:24,705
Pa! Don't you go pullin' any lecherous faces!

108
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:31,795
Say, how come Kurin<i>-chan</i>
isn't here? I'm bored.

109
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:39,195
Hey, Yamucha, take me to
the city for some shopping?

110
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:40,795
Well, you see...

111
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:47,535
Hold on, now, are you sure
you're serious about Kuririn?

112
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:50,535
Maron doesn't know.

113
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:53,875
You don't know? Of all the...

114
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:55,775
She's right!

115
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,875
To get married, you
have to have what it takes...

116
00:11:58,915 --> 00:12:01,615
...for keepin' house and
raisin' children, like I do!

117
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:04,955
You can't be gettin' married
with half-hearted feelin's.

118
00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:09,285
Oh, my! You're such a couple of Auntie<i>-san</i> s!

119
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:12,295
–A-Auntie...
<i>–...san</i> s?

120
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:17,965
She might be one, but not me...

121
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,405
What did you say?!

122
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:22,265
I'm younger than you are!

123
00:12:22,305 --> 00:12:24,935
I'm not the one who looks house-worn!

124
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:27,605
I do not look like I'm house-worn!

125
00:12:27,645 --> 00:12:29,845
I am a lovely, lovely housewife!

126
00:12:34,985 --> 00:12:36,615
This is a fright...

127
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:39,115
I can do whatever I want.

128
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:43,655
Maron will go to a nearby beach now.

129
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:51,965
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, we should search
the ocean floor around here, right?

130
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,995
Yeah. Thanks for helping me out on this.

131
00:14:41,985 --> 00:14:44,815
What's the matter with the fish<i>-san</i> s?

132
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:00,125
It's the Mermaid's Tear!

133
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:21,255
I-I've finally found it!

134
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:29,495
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, watch out!

135
00:16:09,705 --> 00:16:11,335
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

136
00:16:19,715 --> 00:16:21,705
The Mermaid's Tear!

137
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,185
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, watch out!

138
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:26,005
I see. This pearl is the treasure of the fish<i>-san</i> s.

139
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,345
Treasure?

140
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:28,145
Yeah.

141
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:43,925
They're guarding it with everything they have.

142
00:17:52,675 --> 00:17:59,575
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, is it out of the question
to give Maron<i>-san</i> a different present?

143
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:05,775
Do we have to take this pearl
back with us, no matter what?

144
00:18:19,365 --> 00:18:22,525
<i>I'm sorry, Maron-chan. I...</i>

145
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:32,305
Gohan, let's go home.

146
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,005
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

147
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:06,505
Maron<i>-chan...</i>

148
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:09,515
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

149
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:22,355
What's wrong, Kurin<i>-chan</i>?
I hate a gloomy person.

150
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,825
Y-Yeah.

151
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:29,965
You see... Maron<i>-chan...</i>

152
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:31,095
What?

153
00:19:32,975 --> 00:19:39,845
I'll be frank. I'm not sure I have what
it takes to make you happy. And so...

154
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:46,175
Farewell.

155
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:51,525
Kurin<i>-chan...</i>

156
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,495
Say, hold on a minute! How come?

157
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:00,365
Don't you like me any more?

158
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:02,665
S-Sure I do...

159
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:04,565
Then why?

160
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:18,275
You know, for you, Kurin<i>-chan,</i>
I wouldn't mind being a bride...

161
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:22,585
Maron<i>-chan</i>, see, you can't... huh?

162
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:24,545
Bride?

163
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:39,265
M-Maron<i>-chan</i>!

164
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:43,945
Maron<i>-chan</i>!

165
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:51,075
Maron<i>-chan</i>!!

166
00:20:58,255 --> 00:20:59,985
Yo.

167
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:06,295
Say there, honey, how about
going for a drive with me?

168
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:07,295
How far?

169
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:08,625
Metro West.

170
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:11,665
Lucky lucky! I'll go, I'll go!

171
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:34,655
I'm back!

172
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:37,855
Hmm? Where's Maron<i>-chan</i>?

173
00:21:37,895 --> 00:21:40,865
Yeah, well, she wasn't the kind
of girl who would settle down,

174
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:43,495
so "bang," I broke up with her!

175
00:21:47,235 --> 00:21:48,865
You did what?!

176
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:49,865
What a waste!

177
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:54,205
Are you sure about that? She didn't dump you?

178
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,545
Oolong!

179
00:21:55,585 --> 00:21:59,145
Way to go, Kuririn!
I gotta give you more credit.

180
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:04,215
That's right! I can say this now,
but I was against it from the start!

181
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:08,325
So was I. There's somethin' about that li'l lady...

182
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,995
...she lacked any kind of discretion!

183
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:13,365
Didn't she though?

184
00:22:19,675 --> 00:22:21,505
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

185
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:48,695
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

186
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:54,535
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

187
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,905
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

188
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

189
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:11,915
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

190
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:16,025
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

191

<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

192

<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

193
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

194
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,775
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

195
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,575
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

196
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

197
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

198
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

199
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,595
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

200
00:23:55,335 --> 00:24:00,605
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

201
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,285
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

202
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:16,285
<i>Freeza is still alive?!</i>

203
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,185
<i>Judging by the way he's heading for Earth,</i>

204
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,285
<i>he's about to cause more trouble, huh?</i>

205
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:21,555
<i>It's not just one!</i>

206
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:24,325
<i>There's another gut with</i>
<i>impossibly large ki coming this way!</i>

207
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:25,795
<i>How can this be?!</i>

208
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:27,795
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

209

<i>"That There is Earth, Papa...</i>
