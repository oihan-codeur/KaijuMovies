3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:56,315 --> 00:02:00,885
<i>Vegeta, who had recovered</i>
<i>his strength surprisingly quickly,</i>

17
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:04,885
<i>was headed for Planet Namek</i>

18
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:09,455
<i>Elsewhere, Bulma and the others were</i>
<i>held up on a Planet Namek that was illusionary,</i>

19
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:12,435
<i>as were, of course, its Dragon Balls.</i>

20
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:21,465
<i>Will Gohan and company be the</i>
<i>ones who obtain the true Dragon Balls?</i>

21
00:02:21,505 --> 00:02:24,635
<i>Or will it be Vegeta? Or perhaps...?</i>

22

<i>"A Tough New Enemy!</i>
<i>Freeza, Emperor of the Universe."</i>

23
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,465
Dammit!

24
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:05,045
Don't worry, you're just entangled in them.

25
00:03:05,085 --> 00:03:08,415
Just wait until evening,
and you'll get loose all on your own.

26
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:21,295
Who are you guys?
Is this not Planet Namek?

27
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:24,465
It doesn't have any fancy name like that!

28
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:27,865
This scummy planet is
like a big trash heap in space.

29
00:03:27,905 --> 00:03:32,475
It doesn't have any cities, or people,
or anything decent to eat or drink.

30
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:36,875
We were forced down on this planet
when we got caught in some cosmic tides.

31
00:03:36,915 --> 00:03:41,855
Our spaceship was smashed up, and we were
at our wit's end when you folks showed up.

32
00:03:55,705 --> 00:03:59,665
We were going to swipe your
spaceship and get out of here right away,

33
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:02,535
but unfortunately, there is a
gigantic cosmic tidal current in the way,

34
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,235
and we couldn't move.

35
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,215
So, you're saying that you
were just killing time up to now?

36
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,735
That's right. While you were out,
we probed you to find out about Earth,

37
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:36,645
the secret of the Dragon Balls,
and even what Namekians looked like.

38
00:04:55,825 --> 00:04:59,425
Then, the lake, and the giant,
and the ice cave were all...

39
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,225
Illusions that we made you see.

40
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:04,635
W-What kind of despicable joke is this?!

41
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:07,235
It was pretty thrilling, wasn't it?

42
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,435
Get bent, you bastards!

43
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,275
A-As hectic as things are right now–!

44
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:15,175
Don't be mad. In exchange
for taking your spaceship,

45
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,245
we just let you have a
bit of a dream, didn't we?

46
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:19,245
It's better than being killed, right?

47
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:25,255
Yeah, we aren't the
barbaric type. We're more gentle.

48
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:29,255
The cosmic tidal currents
move just a little bit each day.

49
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,265
But once in a very rare while,
an opening appears in them.

50
00:05:33,305 --> 00:05:34,265
An opening?

51
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:38,165
Yeah. And this fog is our indicator of that.

52
00:05:38,205 --> 00:05:41,405
As long as this fog is out, we can escape.

53
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,835
What are you doing?!

54
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,545
We're going to search for the Dragon Balls.

55
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:52,645
We never thought anything
in the world could be so amazing.

56
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,215
This time, <i>you</i> guys stay here.

57
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:58,815
You'll wait until someone else
comes down on this planet. Later!

58
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:01,385
J-Just a minute!

59
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:02,625
Hey!

60
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:05,795
Bulma<i>-san</i>, what are you doing?!
Hurry and go after them!

61
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:08,195
Are you saying I should get
our stuff back by myself?!

62
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:11,175
W-Well, the way things are...

63
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:29,655
Hey, by the way, you <i>do</i>
know how to fly this, don't you?

64
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:34,855
It's simple. You tell this thing
to fly, and it flies, all on its own.

65
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,695
That's amazing.

66
00:06:36,735 --> 00:06:39,855
Okay, let's take off! Open the door!

67
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:49,735
Hey...

68
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,765
What's the matter?! Open the door!

69
00:06:55,615 --> 00:07:00,115
<i>All right! They don't know</i>
<i>how to open the door, do they?</i>

70
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:11,295
–How are you coming, Gohan?
–No good!

71
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:13,765
They're squirming all over,
and I'm getting nowhere!

72
00:07:17,675 --> 00:07:19,795
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

73
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:23,975
D-Darn it!

74
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:43,355
<i>All right, now!</i>

75
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,605
<i>Kuririn-san...</i>

76
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:01,775
<i>All right...</i>

77
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:44,815
What is this?

78
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:47,825
If we don't hurry it up,
the fog is going to lift!

79
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:51,955
Why didn't you make sure to look into this?

80
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:55,965
Shut up! We just need to
bring the girl with us, right?

81
00:08:56,005 --> 00:08:59,375
Huh? Ah, h-hold on...

82
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:28,595
We did it!

83
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,575
Yahoo!

84
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:34,565
Come on, open it!

85
00:09:34,605 --> 00:09:38,575
We can't afford to dally around! Once the
opening in the cosmic tidal currents closes,

86
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:41,005
there's no telling when it will open again!

87
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:44,175
L-Listen, let's all go together, like friends.

88
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:48,585
You're saying you want to come with us
back to our planet? It will take fifty years.

89
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,085
Huh? Fifty years?!

90
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,915
Hurry it up! Hurry, or else!

91
00:09:52,955 --> 00:09:55,125
A-All right.

92
00:09:56,965 --> 00:09:58,935
"Piccolo"

93
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:07,935
All right!

94
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:11,775
So, there's a password, is there?

95
00:10:17,155 --> 00:10:21,545
Take care, now. There is food
to eat, if you're not too fussy.

96
00:10:21,585 --> 00:10:23,555
Like snakes, and lizards.

97
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:26,785
They can be pretty good,
depending on how you cook them.

98
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:30,965
"Piccolo!"

99
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:37,165
What?!

100
00:10:38,605 --> 00:10:40,965
Whew, you're here at last.

101
00:10:41,005 --> 00:10:43,165
I hate snakes.

102
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:48,445
D-Damn it, if that's how it's going to be...

103
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,485
Oh, wow, they're weaker than I thought.

104
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,085
You're right.

105
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,495
I told you, we're not
barbarians, like you guys are.

106
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:04,925
Oh, no!

107
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:09,965
The fog is about to lift! We have to hurry,
or the tidal opening will close! Let's go!

108
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:18,305
Thank you. If it weren't for you,

109
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:22,335
we wouldn't have known how
to get out of here. See you later.

110
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,985
Bulma<i>-san</i>, where is the
opening in the cosmic tide?

111
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:38,125
I can see it now. It's where
that gas is blowing through.

112
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,125
It's almost closed!

113
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,125
It's all or nothing.

114
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:43,765
Here we go!

115
00:12:01,025 --> 00:12:01,985
We got through!

116
00:12:02,025 --> 00:12:03,555
We've slid in safe!

117
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:06,185
Now, we have to make up for lost time.

118
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,255
Destination: Planet Namek. Full speed.

119
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:18,595
How strong those guys were!
They were too much for us.

120
00:12:18,635 --> 00:12:21,975
I wonder when the next
one will come down here.

121
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:24,775
<i>At that moment,</i>

122
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:30,405
<i>Vegeta was hastening along his route</i>
<i>toward Planet Namek from a different direction.</i>

123
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:39,515
<i>I won't let Freeza have it his way any longer.</i>

124
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:43,155
<i>I will make sure I get the</i>
<i>Dragon Balls, just you watch!</i>

125
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:17,225
Say, Goku<i>-sa...</i>

126
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:18,795
W-What?

127
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:22,225
It's been a month already, huh?

128
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:24,235
Y-Yeah...

129
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:28,265
I forgot to give him some nail clippers.

130
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:32,275
I'd send him some if
there were a delivery service.

131
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:36,015
Y-Yeah, I guess so. That's too bad, huh?

132
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,925
Y-You were standing guard, huh?

133
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:52,595
<i>Thirty-four days after blasting off from Earth,</i>

134
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:57,935
<i>Bulma and the others had finally</i>
<i>arrived at their destination of Planet Namek.</i>

135
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:01,605
We made it! There it is! There it is!

136
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:03,165
Wow, it sure is pretty.

137
00:14:03,205 --> 00:14:05,775
It's the real one this time, right?

138
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:10,815
No question about it. The computer
says that this is the genuine Planet Namek.

139
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:14,215
We got here four days later than we planned.

140
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:17,015
It's just like those kids said.

141
00:14:17,055 --> 00:14:20,225
It's a good thing we took that shortcut.

142
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:22,655
Everything turned out all right, didn't it?

143
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,625
I guess so. Now, we're going to land,
so sit down and fasten your seatbelts.

144
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,795
There's going to be quite a jolt.

145
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,935
Commence landing in a suitable location.

146
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,195
We did it! We've landed on Planet Namek!

147
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:07,575
We're here!

148
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,845
Hang on, now. I'll examine the
composition of the atmosphere.

149
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:18,575
I made sure to install some sensors.
Wasn't that prudent of me?

150
00:15:18,615 --> 00:15:21,185
We'll be lucky enough if
there's some level of oxygen here,

151
00:15:21,225 --> 00:15:23,085
but I also prepared some atmospheric masks,

152
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,115
though that will limit our
time out there to roughly...

153
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:41,405
This looks sort of like the place
where I trained with Piccolo<i>-san.</i>

154
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:48,075
Yeah, where we first fought the Saiyans, right?

155
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:52,015
I suppose a place that was similar to his
home would instinctively be more settling.

156
00:15:53,155 --> 00:15:55,945
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

157
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:59,955
You guys don't <i>ever</i> learn
from your previous lessons, do you?!

158
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:02,555
How can you just waltz on out here like this?!

159
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:05,555
You sure are as scary as ever.

160
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:10,125
For crying out loud. Well, it's okay,
as long as there are Dragon Balls here.

161
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:11,865
Please...

162
00:16:13,175 --> 00:16:15,605
Look! I'm reading them!

163
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:19,175
Hooray! Now we can finally–

164
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:21,005
What are you doing?

165
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:26,615
Oh, I was wondering if we weren't
being tricked again, so just to make sure...

166
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:28,015
It's for real, I tell you!

167
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,045
Yow! All right!

168
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:33,015
Hooray!

169
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:36,355
–Hooray, hooray!
–Hooray, hooray, hooray!

170
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:42,595
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, there's a
strong <i>ki</i> coming from over there.

171
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,065
A <i>ki</i>?

172
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,725
You're right.

173
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:49,935
I'm sensing a lot of them.

174
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,505
Yeah, and they're all incredible <i>ki</i>, too.

175
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,975
W-What does it mean?

176
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,545
Oh, come on, what are you talking
about? Those are the Namekians.

177
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,985
With Kami<i>-sama</i> and Piccolo
being as strong as they were,

178
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:04,555
it's not at all strange that
the Namekians from their home

179
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,555
would have incredible <i>ki</i>, too.

180
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:07,285
But still...

181
00:17:07,325 --> 00:17:09,985
Those <i>ki</i> do feel a little bit evil, huh?

182
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:16,965
It's okay, I tell you. Kaio<i>-sama</i> said that
Namekians were gentle by nature, didn't he?

183
00:17:17,005 --> 00:17:21,535
There are four Dragon Balls
gathered together in that direction.

184
00:17:21,575 --> 00:17:24,535
Come on, let's go meet the Namekians.

185
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:29,975
Oh, yeah. Yeah, you're right.
They must be Namekians.

186
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:32,285
I shouldn't have gotten so jittery, huh?

187
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:46,365
H-Haven't we seen that someplace before?

188
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:51,535
It's a Saiyan spaceship!

189
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,765
I knew it!

190
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,075
It can't be!

191
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:03,075
Again? Are you serious? How?

192
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,915
Gohan, mask your presence! We'll be detected!

193
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:07,085
R-Right.

194
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:11,915
I-It's Vegeta. He's the only one it could be.

195
00:18:11,955 --> 00:18:13,925
Dammit!

196
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:17,055
Has he already healed?

197
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:22,935
Come to think about it, he
knows about the Dragon Balls, too.

198
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:29,565
What do we do? It's hopeless. The only
thing we can do now is return to Earth, right?

199
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:31,975
Isn't that so? Let's hurry back.

200
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:35,145
If that guy gets the Dragon Balls, it's over.

201
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:40,945
Bulma<i>-san</i>, please contact Earth and tell
them about this, then go on back by yourself.

202
00:18:40,985 --> 00:18:44,555
Me and Gohan will stay here
and try to collect the Dragon Balls.

203
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:45,955
But...

204
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:50,055
It's okay. We'll have the Dragon Radar.

205
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,455
Isn't that right, Gohan?

206
00:18:51,495 --> 00:18:52,895
Right.

207
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:54,425
All right.

208
00:18:54,465 --> 00:18:58,895
Once I get back to Earth, I'll bring
Son<i>-kun</i> on board and come back for you.

209
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:04,105
The round trip will take a little
over two months, though. Wait for us!

210
00:19:04,145 --> 00:19:07,505
It's okay! Two months will pass like <i>that</i>!

211
00:19:07,545 --> 00:19:13,115
I mean, it's only sixty days! 1,440 hours!
86,400 minutes! 5,184,000 seconds!

212
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:14,945
Right?!

213
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:18,895
R-Right. A little more than two months, right?

214
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:40,235
Freeza, you bastard! I won't let
you snatch them away from me!

215
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:45,145
I should be able to handle
everyone besides Freeza,

216
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,485
but I don't stand a chance of
winning if I fight him head-to-head.

217
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:52,285
Whatever happens, I have to get the
Balls away from him and gain eternal life.

218
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:56,125
Tch! To think I'd be stuck
using a Scouter again...

219
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,355
This way, huh?

220
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:10,335
He's brought Zarbon and
Dodoria with him too, has he?

221
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,475
W-What was that?

222
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:19,875
S-So now what? Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm...

223
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:22,515
Right. So tell that to Son<i>-kun</i> and the others.

224
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,915
Do you read me? Just
don't tell Chichi<i>-san.</i> Got that?

225
00:20:26,955 --> 00:20:29,355
Right... right... mm-hmm...

226
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:33,355
I already told you... are you listening to me?

227
00:20:33,395 --> 00:20:36,365
No, tell everyone <i>but</i> Chichi! Sheesh!

228
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:40,335
Right! Got it?! We're counting on you! Goodbye!

229
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,535
Good grief...

230
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,405
What's the matter, you two?

231
00:20:50,445 --> 00:20:53,315
Huh? What?

232
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:05,295
W-Why is there another one coming?

233
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:08,325
T-That's what <i>I'd</i> like to know.

234
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,295
Here it is, Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

235
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:40,625
Oh, very good, very good.

236
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:44,505
Now there are three more, yes?

237
00:21:56,985 --> 00:22:01,885
<i>At last, the evil hidden hand, Freeza, appears.</i>

238
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:21,465
<i>Will Gohan and Kuririn indeed</i>
<i>be able to collect the Dragon Balls?</i>

239
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:48,695
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

240
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:54,535
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

241
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,905
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

242
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

243
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:11,915
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

244
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:16,025
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

245
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:19,525
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

246
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,195
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

247
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,675
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

248
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,775
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

249
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,575
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

250
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

251
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

252
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

253
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,595
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

254
00:23:55,335 --> 00:24:00,605
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

255
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:14,385
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

256
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:16,615
<i>Damn it, I can't just sit around here like this!</i>

257
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:20,085
<i>Freeza is doing whatever he pleases</i>
<i>to our star of hope, Planet Namek!</i>

258
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,485
<i>I must say, Vegeta certainly is reckless.</i>

259
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:27,225
<i>Imagine, coming out in</i>
<i>open rebellion against me.</i>

260
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,065
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

261
00:24:29,105 --> 00:24:32,435
<i>"Vegeta's Ambition! I am the</i>
<i>Greatest Warrior in the Universe!!"</i>

262
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:36,645
<i>Father, our spaceship has been wrecked.</i>

263
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,275
"Next time"
"Vegeta's Ambition! I am the
Greatest Warrior in the Universe!!"
