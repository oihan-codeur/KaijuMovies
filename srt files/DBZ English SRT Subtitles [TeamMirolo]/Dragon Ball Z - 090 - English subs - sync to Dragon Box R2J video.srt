16
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,160
I thought you weren't
going to use your hands, right?

17
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,970
The service time has run out.

18
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,470
Well, let me offer my service,
if you want to call it that,

19
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,340
by giving you some advice.

20
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:51,810
You put too much faith in your own strength.

21
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,680
As a result, you leave
yourself wide open to attack.

22
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,480
My thanks.

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,490
<i>Amazing! Can both fighters still be</i>
<i>in the initial phase of their battles?</i>

24
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,530
<i>Just how far will their powers extend?</i>

25
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,210

<i>Son Goku, an Audacious, Wonderful Guy."</i>

26
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,780
You're strong!

27
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,450
Enough that I would
even say marvelously so.

28
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,120
Why, thank you.

29
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,950
However, I am growing tired of this fight.

30
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,830
I'm thinking it's about
time to bring it to a conclusion.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,790
Before the end, let me ask you,
just in case. How about it?

32
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,500
Wouldn't you like to work underneath me?

33
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,470
It would be a shame to have to
wipe out all that power you have.

34
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,780
You would be able to do work so
much better than Commander Ginyu.

35
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,110
You've got to be kidding.

36
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,480
You really expect me to accept that offer?

37
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,120
I thought you would say that.

38
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,490
You Saiyans as a group are
stubborn to the point of being fools.

39
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,960
Well, there is only one
route left for you to take.

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,490
Just death.

41
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,000
We'll see. It won't be so easy.

42
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:34,450
Such confidence! But I am
aware of what you're doing.

43
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,420
While you say you're being serious,

44
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,790
you're still keeping back
a good deal of your power.

45
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,820
My secret's out, is it?

46
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Keeping that in mind, the way I figure it,

47
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,970
using about 50 percent,

48
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,970
or in other words, half of my max power,

49
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,810
I can turn you into space dust!

50
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,510
What?!

51
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,140
That's a bit of an exaggeration!

52
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,180
You're trying to feed me too large a bluff.

53
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,520
It's been fun.

54
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,500
It's been quite a long time
since I've had this kind of exercise.

55
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,990
W-What's going on?

56
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,160
Those two are just
staring at each other now.

57
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,160
Both of them are searching for
the right timing to begin again.

58
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,770
Besides which, it feels
like we're about to be crushed

59
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,170
by both of their tremendous <i>ki</i> alone.

60
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,840
Father can win this, right?

61
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,140
There's no way we can tell.

62
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,850
Their power is particularly greater
than anything we can comprehend.

63
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,160
That's true.

64
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,170

70
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,340
<i>Hurry up and give me my body back!</i>

71
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,190
I can't see in front of us!

72
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,520
Look out!

73
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,090
T-That was perfect!

74
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,760
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>!

75
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,270
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>, why have you come here?

76
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,140
It's extremely dangerous!

77
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,410
Bulma<i>-san</i>?

78
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,250
Huh? What's that?

79
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,590
Goku and Freeza are over there...

80
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,220
What?

81
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,260
Bulma<i>-san</i>, you shouldn't go there!

82
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,500
T-That's Freeza<i>-sama</i>?

83
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,020
It's a shame. It really is a shame.

84
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,590
If you were to become one of my men,
wonderful things would await you every day.

85
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,460
King Vegeta, Vegeta...

86
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:11,020
...and that lower-class warrior Burdock...

87
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,500
Every single one of them, so terribly obstinate.

88
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,170
<i>Dammit...</i>

89
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,000
That's what cost them their lives.

90
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:38,140
H-How marvelous!

91
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:43,150
Freeza<i>-sama</i>'s body is responding
spontaneously to Goku's power!

92
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,820
<i>After taking Goku's attacks, every</i>
<i>nerve in his body has a precise read on him.</i>

93
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,820
<i>Is this the power of Freeza?</i>

94
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,460
Fantastic!

95
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,490
Bulma<i>-san...</i>

96
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,810
<i>That over there isn't me! It's a frog, a frog!</i>

97
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,520
<i>I'm Bulma! You have to understand!</i>

98
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,520
All right! Nice!

99
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,490
Ah, I get it! You're...

100
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,160
<i>You've finally gotten it, huh?!</i>

101
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,870
You're that Ginyu guy!

102
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,610
What are you doing hanging
around in a place like this?

103
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,440
You'd better hurry and seek
shelter somewhere, it's dangerous here!

104
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,820
<i>That's not it!</i>

105
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,130
Using about 50 percent, or in
other words, half of my max power,

106
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,530
I can turn you into space dust!

107
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,840
He ain't bluffing...

108
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,980
<i>What speed</i>!

109
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,010
<i>I didn't see that at all!</i>

110
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,640
–Son!
–Father!

111
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:54,940
Bravo! What an attack to behold!

112
00:13:54,980 --> 00:14:01,980
To think that I should be able to
see Freeza<i>-sama</i>'s form like this! I... I...

113
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,050
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, I'm so glad
I trusted and stayed with you!

114
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,950
What are you saying, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

115
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,160
Father is the one getting beaten up!

116
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,790
That's right!

117
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,170
Bulma<i>-san</i>, please go somewhere
safe and take refuge right away!

118
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,300
What are you talking about?!

119
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,330
I'll never see another fight like this!

120
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,120
I wonder if she hit her head or
something back when we left her by herself.

121
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,590
<i>Again, I couldn't see Freeza's movement...</i>

122
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,600
<i>Can there be this much</i>
<i>difference in our powers?</i>

123
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,270
Didn't I say so? If I use
only half of my max power,

124
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,800
I could turn you into space dust, as I recall.

125
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,810
Dammit!

126
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,130
On you go!

127
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,280
All righty.

128
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,480
Takeoff preparations are complete.

129
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,630
Sensei, give Son-in-law our best!

130
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:05,640
Tell Gohan I'm waitin' for him here on Earth!

131
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:14,480
Ask Bulma<i>-chan</i> to bring us back some
souvenirs of Planet Namek's cakes, okay!

132
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,790
Sit tight, Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

133
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,660
We're comin' to save you right now!

134
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,460
Is this for real?

135
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,160
Are we actually going to Planet Namek?!

136
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,300
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!

137

(Amidha sutra)

138
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,940
Is everyone ready for this?

139
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,610
It's about time for the countdown.

140
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,950
10... 9...

141
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,620
8... 7...

142
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,960

Blast-off!

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,780
Here it goes...

150
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,790
Y-Y-Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!

151
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,020
Lemme off! I don't wanna die yet!

152
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,560
Lemme off! Lemme off, 'kay?! 'Kay?!

153
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,080
Hey, forgive me, forgive me.

154
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,790
I made a mistake!

155
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,100
Welcome!

156
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,810
Your speed is too low! Anyone can see that!

157
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,020
What's the matter?

158
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,230
Never mind half my max power,
I'm not even using a third!

159
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,310
Serves you right!

160
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,430
Looks like you're finally
starting to get a little winded.

161
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:23,170
Then again, it's amazing you haven't died yet.

162
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,710
I-It's no use. He's too strong!

163
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,380
To think he's this strong...!

164
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,850
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, Goku is still
wearing that heavy gi, isn't he?

165
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,790
What he has on now is
only tough, it's not heavy.

166
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,120
I-I see...

167
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,260
O-Oh no! Is there anything else?

168
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,590
Goku...

169
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,490
There's nothing to worry about, Chaozu!

170
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,000
Goku is going to win this fight!

171
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,000
Aren't you forgetting
about the <i>Kaio-ken</i> technique?

172
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,100
With Goku as he is now,

173
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,670
he should be able to withstand as
much as ten times his regular power!

174
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,010
Oh, yeah!

175
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,240
That's it!

176
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,610
–All right!
–All right, all right!

177
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,490
No...

178
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:57,600
Regrettably, what he's using right
now is that very times ten <i>Kaio-ken...</i>

179
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,470
It can't be!

180
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,640
T-This isn't good! There's too
much difference in their abilities!

181
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,150
Father...

182
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,450
Bulma<i>-san</i>?

183
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,990
That's our Freeza<i>-sama</i>!
Against Goku... such grandeur!

184
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,820
W-Who the hell are you?!

185
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,330
Who, me?

186
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,030
Watch out, Piccolo!

187
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,940
<i>As Kaio's words cut off any</i>
<i>encouraging news about Goku,</i>

188
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,600
<i>who is already using a ten-fold Kaio-ken,</i>

189
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,140
<i>is there any glimmer of</i>
<i>hope remaining for him?</i>

190
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,490
<i>And what of Ginyu, as he closes in</i>
<i>on Piccolo with his finishing technique?</i>

191
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,710
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

192
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,550
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

193
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,920
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

194
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,420
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

195
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,930
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

196

<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

197

<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

198

<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

199
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,680
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

200
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,780
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

201
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,590
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

202
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,620
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

203
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:45,300
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

204
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,470
<i>So sorry.</i>

205
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:52,600
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

206

<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

207
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,090
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

208
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:16,290
<i>This is the only way to defeat Freeza!</i>

209
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,200
<i>I'm raising my Kaio-ken to times-20!</i>

210
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,300

211
