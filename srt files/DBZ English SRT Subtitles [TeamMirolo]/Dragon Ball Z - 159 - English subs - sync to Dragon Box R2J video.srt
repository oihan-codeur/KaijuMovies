5

<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:13,595
I would not be proud of myself if I defeated you

00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:15,895
the pathetic way you are now.

18
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:19,315
Very well. You may become your perfect form.

19

<i>What's this, has Vegeta let Cell go</i>

00:02:43,215 --> 00:02:46,675
<i>As well, Kuririn had by his own hand...</i>

21

<i>...destroyed the device that</i>
<i>would have shut down No. 18!</i>

22
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:07,825
Get away safely!

23
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:11,865
No matter what, don't
get absorbed by Cell! Please!

00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,995
<i>Great! Now I can become my perfect form!</i>

<i>This is bad! They haven't</i>

33
00:04:31,235 --> 00:04:33,905
Why?! This was your singular chance!

34
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:36,365
Just what is it you think you're doing?

35
00:04:36,405 --> 00:04:38,865
I-It's just...

36
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,835
<i>Stop staring me down like that, would you?</i>

37
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:51,045
That doesn't matter!

38
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:52,635
In any case, just get away safely!

39
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:55,975
If you're too slow about it, you'll
be swallowed up by Cell, you know!

40
00:04:56,015 --> 00:05:00,555
I beg you! The destiny
of the Earth rests with you!

41
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,395
Hey!!

42
00:05:04,435 --> 00:05:06,105
You've been found by Cell!

43
00:05:13,445 --> 00:05:14,525
Oh, no!

44
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,245
I will not allow you your perfect form!

45
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,375
So, then...

46
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:32,885
Luckily enough, the
Artificial Humans are here, huh?

47
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:24,305
Amazing! Is that how strong Trunks has become?

48
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:43,245
His <i>ki</i> has vanished.

49
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:48,665
Run! Cell has concealed his presence
and is sneaking around underground!

50
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:55,125
T-This is dangerous!
We have to hurry and scram!

51
00:06:56,175 --> 00:07:00,965
R-Right! No. 16!

52
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:03,385
No. 16!

53
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:07,855
I'll be fine. You guys run away!

54
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:12,605
I cannot protect you any more. Go now!

55
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:46,385
No, dammit!

56
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,185
This is an extraordinary chance for me.

57
00:07:52,225 --> 00:07:54,185
I won't let you interfere, Trunks!

58
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:25,215
It's been a while, hasn't it, No. 18?

59
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:37,065
Don't strain yourself, No. 16.

60
00:08:37,105 --> 00:08:40,445
You're only moments from
shutting down, aren't you?

61
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:43,825
On top of which,

62
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:48,785
Vegeta seems to be cooperating in
allowing me to become my perfect form.

63
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:52,125
Damn it, Vegeta!

64
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:58,625
Now then, shall I have her?
My most first-class cuisine?

65
00:09:01,005 --> 00:09:03,675
What are you loafing around for, Cell?

66
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:06,845
Hurry up and become
this perfect form of yours!

67
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:11,135
That fool!

68
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:24,985
That cursed Vegeta!

69
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:28,115
What? What's happened to Vegeta?

70
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,165
Hey, there!

71
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:32,995
What's happening with Vegeta?

72
00:09:33,035 --> 00:09:37,795
And what about Trunks? Hey there, I said!

73
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:42,125
<i>Still not yet? Hurry up, Son!</i>

74
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,845
Thanks, Vegeta.

75
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,395
We had quite an intrusion there, didn't we?

76
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,195
You piece of crap!

77
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:10,365
Small fry!

78
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:19,085
For a mechanical doll
who has turned into junk,

79
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,965
this is what your power ought to be, I suppose.

80
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:24,545
It isn't hurting a bit.

81
00:10:30,345 --> 00:10:31,765
You miserable monster!

82
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,585
Dad, you are mistaken!

83
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,375
We can't let him reach his perfect form!

84
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:05,795
What are you going to do if his
power becomes greater than ours?

85
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,295
You're so pathetic!

86
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:10,845
Don't you feel like seeing
how strong he will become?

87
00:11:10,885 --> 00:11:14,475
I... I don't want to see it!

88
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:21,145
I've had enough hellish futures!

89
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:24,905
You'll see, I will prevent his perfect form!

90
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:28,405
Even if I have to defeat you, Dad!

91
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:30,405
Defeat me?

92
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:36,745
Impossible! I don't think you're
capable of attacking your father.

93
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:39,785
If you can shoot me, then shoot me!

94
00:12:53,365 --> 00:12:55,905
I-I'm sorry, Father.

95
00:12:55,945 --> 00:12:57,655
Since I'm making so little progress,

96
00:12:57,695 --> 00:13:01,375
Father, your training hasn't advanced at all.

97
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:07,375
That's fine! You just worry
about becoming Super Saiyan!

98
00:13:07,415 --> 00:13:09,375
R-Right!

99
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:12,095
Now, we're off to bed for the rest of the day.

100
00:13:12,135 --> 00:13:14,965
We have more harsh training
waiting for us tomorrow.

101
00:13:15,005 --> 00:13:16,055
Right!

102
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:10,605
Damn...

103
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,445
So, it's all over?

104
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:25,125
N-No. 18...

105
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:49,225
It's all hopeless!

106
00:14:58,825 --> 00:15:01,995
Hurry! Get away from here as fast as you can!

107
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,495
Why, you...!

108
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:31,395
Don't worry about me! Get going, now!

109
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:33,435
I can't do that!

110
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:39,775
Y-You...

111
00:15:46,035 --> 00:15:48,585
Damn that Trunks...

112
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,455
He really did shoot me!

113
00:15:57,335 --> 00:16:00,425
That bratty piece of crap!

114
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,825
I won't let you get away!

115
00:16:51,935 --> 00:16:54,475
I won't let you get away!

116
00:16:57,775 --> 00:17:01,695
I won't let you run anywhere, No. 18.

117
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:12,705
That brat...!

118
00:17:18,415 --> 00:17:20,545
<i>Taiyo-ken</i>!!

119
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:29,595
No, dammit!

120
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:32,765
My eyes...!

121
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:45,025
Now, to savor you slowly, No. 18...!

122
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:09,465
Damn it all!

123
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:28,445
S-Stop it!

124
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:37,535
No. 18!

125
00:18:51,925 --> 00:18:53,175
Damn...

126
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:27,385
Cell is changing!

127
00:19:27,425 --> 00:19:31,175
Is this perfect form of
his finally coming around?

128
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:50,485
<i>You're sure taking long enough.</i>

129
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:53,035
<i>Don't you disappoint me this time!</i>

130
00:19:54,785 --> 00:19:57,615
Damned if I'm going to let
you reach your perfect form!

131
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:33,195
What's going on here?

132
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:37,325
It's as if the whole Earth
is trembling, you know?

133
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:40,495
Cell's <i>ki</i> is continuing to swell up!

134
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:15,025
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>!

135
00:21:16,615 --> 00:21:18,405
Dende, huh?

136
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,035
You've felt it too, have you?

137
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:24,995
What is this evil <i>ki</i>?

138
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,625
What in the world is happening on Earth?

139
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:29,965
I don't know.

140
00:21:30,005 --> 00:21:33,555
I don't know, but at
this rate, it's not just Earth,

141
00:21:33,595 --> 00:21:37,305
but the whole universe that could be destroyed.

142
00:21:37,345 --> 00:21:39,635
T-The whole universe?

143
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:03,745
<i>I-I was wrong not to have shut down No. 18...</i>

144
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:17,515
<i>At last... At last, No. 18 having been absorbed,</i>

145
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:20,635
<i>Cell is becoming his perfect form.</i>

146
00:22:20,675 --> 00:22:26,305
<i>Will his terrifying form lead</i>
<i>the universe to devastation?</i>

147
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:47,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

148
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:53,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

149
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:55,885
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

150
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:04,385
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

151
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,895
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

152
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:14,985
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

153
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,485
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

154
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:21,155
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

155
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:28,665
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

156
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,755
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

157
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:34,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

158
