3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:32,105
<i>Freeza's fearsome, severely brutal</i>
<i>power assaults Goku again and again.</i>

17
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:41,785
<i>However, Goku is not giving in.</i>

18
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:50,135
They're freaks! Both of them, dammit!

19
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:55,435
I think I'll put an end
to all this warming up,

20
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,965
and finally get serious about this.

21
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:01,275
Me too.

22
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:05,485
<i>Is this where the real super battle begins?</i>

23
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:13,425
<i>"Freeza's Terrible Declaration!</i>
<i>I Will Defeat You Without Using My Hands."</i>

24
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,445
W-What a <i>ki</i>!

25
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:06,765
Mid-air battle or ground
battle, which are you better at?

26
00:05:06,805 --> 00:05:10,805
Which, you ask? I guess ground battle.

27
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,665
Where are they going?

28
00:05:33,705 --> 00:05:35,695
They're just changing locations.

29
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:41,335
They're probably moving to someplace
where they can fight to their heart's content.

30
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,005
What incredible guys!

31
00:05:44,045 --> 00:05:45,475
Father...

32
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:07,065
This means we're going to fight
on the ground, where I'm better at it?

33
00:06:07,105 --> 00:06:08,725
I'm getting good service.

34
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:13,105
Or is it... you're that confident?

35
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:18,335
When you look at me this way, I'm very kind.

36
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:23,345
I know! How about I offer
you another great service?

37
00:06:23,385 --> 00:06:26,075
Great service?

38
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:29,515
I will keep myself from using both my hands!

39
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,015
How's that?

40
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:32,585
Both hands?

41
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,965
How very generous of you.

42
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:47,105
So then, can I start us off?

43
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,275
Of course.

44
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:53,775
Whatever you like.

45
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:55,465
Ah, I've finally perfected it.

46
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,435
Well, she sure seems
to be in a hurry to depart.

47
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:31,465
Yes, indeed!

48
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:35,445
Why are you dawdlin' around?!

49
00:08:35,485 --> 00:08:39,445
Tell me! When exactly can we leave?!

50
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,945
While we're all down here
like this, my Gohan<i>-chan</i> is...!

51
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:43,785
Gohan<i>-chan</i> is...!

52
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:47,485
S-See here, Chichi<i>-san</i>! Calm down!

53
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,425
Yes, indeed!

54
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:55,225
What are you doin' durin' all this commotion?!

55
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,395
Dirty old man!

56
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,065
Not at all, Chichi<i>-san</i>!

57
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:04,035
Yeah, converting this from a
single-seater to a five-seater is quite a chore.

58
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:08,805
Ah, that reminds me, I haven't decided
where to place the stereo speakers.

59
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:13,185
We don't need that stuff!
Hurry up and make this thing go!

60
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:17,685
The biggest issue there is the energy, you see.

61
00:09:18,895 --> 00:09:21,585
The difficulty is, in order to fill
up this spaceship with energy,

62
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:26,465
it's going to take a little time.

63
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:29,465
So?

64
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:31,835
How long's it gonna take?

65
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,405
Well, I just started a
moment ago, so... I don't know.

66
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:37,435
<i>What?!</i>

67
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,105
You know, guys...

68
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,845
How come we have to
go to Planet Namek too?

69
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:49,745
That's the place where Piccolo was born.

70
00:09:49,785 --> 00:09:54,785
On top of that, Vegeta and other
even more terrifying guys will be there!

71
00:09:57,795 --> 00:09:59,255
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!

72
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,235
I, Pu-erh, vow to go and strike
down Yamucha<i>-sama</i>'s enemies!

73
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:05,765
"Certain Victory"
Please just sit tight, okay?

74
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:08,465
You're not gonna live too long, are you?

75
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:11,775
<i>Come on! To think, me, goin' to Planet Namek?</i>

76
00:10:11,815 --> 00:10:15,145
<i>Don't even kid 'bout that!</i>
<i>I'm gettin' out while I still...</i>

77
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:21,445
Thinking of running away by
yourself, huh? Not going to be that easy!

78
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:39,135
Oh dear, what's the matter?
Have you finished attacking?

79
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:50,145
Your motions are too slow!

80
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:09,425
There, and now from the left.

81
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:12,095
Next, from the right!

82
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:15,305
Right! Left! Right!

83
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:17,435
And the final one, left!

84
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:49,765
He's strong! Got great
speed too, as big as his talk.

85
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:53,675
G-Goku...

86
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,445
Father!

87
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,255
It's strange. Here I am fighting
someone so incredibly strong,

88
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,785
and I'm giddy with excitement!

89
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:53,135
If you're not going to come at me,
then I'll bring it to you again!

90
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,095
You know something, I'm glad I met you!

91
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:04,435
I was getting so bored, and the creatures
on this planet are all so weird anyhow...

92
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:07,605
Ah, sorry, sorry! I've hurt your feelings!

93
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,265
You're an exception!

94
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:13,235
When I first saw all of you
clustered around, I was all freaked out,

95
00:15:13,275 --> 00:15:15,445
but you alone were different!

96
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:46,945
That's enough!

97
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:50,945
Who would ever expect me to
die here among all these frogs?!

98
00:15:59,995 --> 00:16:02,125
Ah, so gross!

99
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:23,805
You seemed to have a lot of
promise, so I'll let you be my friend!

100
00:16:53,315 --> 00:16:55,145
Do you want to eat some too?

101
00:17:03,025 --> 00:17:08,125
For a frog, you're really
eating this stuff, huh? Well then...

102
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:09,925
Would you eat some of this, too?

103
00:17:29,685 --> 00:17:32,645
It's been a long time since I laughed so hard!

104
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,785
Overall, you really do seem
to understand what I'm saying.

105
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:42,985
Say! If we had a translator
device, I bet I could talk to you!

106
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:46,125
I'm so clever!

107
00:17:55,045 --> 00:17:56,335
It's finished!

108
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,145
That was easier than I expected.

109
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:04,045
Indeed, the word "impossible" doesn't
exist for a genius like me, Bulma<i>-sama</i>!

110
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,715
Here goes!

111
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:08,715
Switch on!

112
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,085
Go on, try saying something!

113
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,785
Don't be shy!

114
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:17,785
<i>Chaan-ge!!</i>

115
00:18:18,435 --> 00:18:21,455
W-What's this? What is it?

116
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:36,445
You're the first person I'd encountered
in some time, so I tagged along,

117
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:38,315
hoping some kind of
chance would come around...

118
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:41,815
...but to think that I'd be
able to <i>Change</i> so soon...

119
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:46,795
W-What am I doing over there?!

120
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,465
Just what is going on here?!

121
00:18:54,005 --> 00:18:55,925
You have my gratitude, little miss.

122
00:18:55,965 --> 00:18:59,135
It's enough that I want
to dance the Dance of Joy!

123
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:04,805
However, this is one unsightly form!

124
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:14,145
Well then, how about I set
out to find a stronger body?

125
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:08,105
<i>Who would have thought he</i>
<i>could have possibly done this much?</i>

126
00:20:19,015 --> 00:20:23,785
<i>Dammit... I can't get free...!</i>

127
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:33,125
I thought you weren't
going to use your hands, right?

128
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,265
The service time has run out.

129
00:21:43,305 --> 00:21:45,435
Well, let me offer my service,

130
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:46,935
if you want to call it that,
by giving you some advice.

131
00:21:46,975 --> 00:21:48,605
Advice?

132
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:53,335
You put too much faith in your own strength.

133
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:56,715
As a result, you leave
yourself wide open to attack.

134
00:22:00,015 --> 00:22:02,815
My thanks.

135
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,455
<i>Incredible!</i>

136
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,965
<i>Goku's super power is such that</i>

137

<i>With his pride injured,</i>
<i>will Freeza's anger explode?</i>

138

<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

139

<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

140
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:55,575
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

141
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:04,075
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

142
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:10,585
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

143

<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

147
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,435
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

148
00:23:32,475 --> 00:23:34,245
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

149
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:38,275
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

150
00:23:38,315 --> 00:23:43,945
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

151
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:46,115
<i>So sorry.</i>

00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,745
<i>I'm so glad to be able</i>
<i>to fight against someone</i>

156
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:17,915
<i>with the awesome ability that Freeza has.</i>

157
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:20,925
<i>Goku says that he's fighting seriously,</i>

158
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,455
<i>but he's still keeping</i>
<i>back quite a bit of power.</i>

00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,495
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

<i>"That Was No I dle Boast!!</i>
<i>Son Goku, an Audacious, Wonderful Guy."</i>

00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,535
<i>F-Father, you can beat him, right?</i>

162
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:36,975
"Next time"
"That Was No Idle Boast!!
