<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

6
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:54,525

<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

Look, don't get so depressed.
I'm surprised at this myself.

24
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:15,145
To think that I would be able
to make this big a fool out of you!

25
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:18,355
Y-You piece of crap! In that case...

26
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:37,745
Now, go, my ghosts!
<i>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack</i>!!

27
00:03:03,355 --> 00:03:05,695
That's what you get for looking
down on them as child's techniques,

28
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:07,445
you wretched fool!

29
00:03:12,115 --> 00:03:16,415
You're the one who's the fool.
You should have realized it sooner!

30
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:31,715
<i>Goku and Vegeta have merged,</i>
<i>giving rise to the ultimate warrior Vegetto.</i>

31
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:35,515
<i>With his ultra power, Vegetto</i>
<i>has beaten Majin Boo soundly,</i>

32
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:37,435
<i>until finally he had him cornered.</i>

33
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:50,775
What are you going to do?
Do you plan on continuing still?

34
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,575
All right!

35
00:03:55,615 --> 00:03:59,285
Hey, do you like coffee candy?

36
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:23,315
<i>"A Hero Lost!? Vegetto is Absorbed."</i>

37
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:35,945
I-It can't be...!

38
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:50,635
J-J-Just a minute now, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

39
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:53,845
You wouldn't possibly
tell us to go after him, right?

40
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:03,315
I doubt there's any choice.

41
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:06,935
You guys are the only ones
now that can fight against Boo.

42
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:13,945
That was the reason I had Yama-<i>sama</i>
leave you your bodies in the first place.

43
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:15,485
Even if that's so,

44
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:20,325
there's a whole different dimension
of strength between us and Majin Boo.

45
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:26,505
And Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you don't seriously
think that we could possibly win, do you?

46
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:29,335
W-Well, as far as that goes...

47
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:36,005
I, for one, refuse. I am not about to
be eaten by Majin Boo again. No way!!

48
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:44,555
Hey, how's it going? Things should just
about be settled by now, shouldn't they?

49
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:49,855
I feel so refreshed!

50
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:54,865
Yamucha! Where have you
been during this emergency?

51
00:05:54,905 --> 00:06:03,495
Emergency? I'd exercised, so I went
to use the showers. So refreshing!

52
00:06:03,535 --> 00:06:08,915
Even so, this is quite a dull place, huh?
There's no one but tough guys here.

53
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:13,925
I wonder if there are any
cute, bubbly girls around.

54
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:27,725
That does it. Maybe leaving
them with their bodies was a mistake.

55
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,785
I did it! I finally did it!

56
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:48,455
How pathetic, becoming a hard candy!
You truly are helpless now!

57
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:52,965
Well, don't get too discouraged!
I'll be eating you soon enough!

58
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:59,425
Little by little, little by little,
I'll slowly dissolve you in my mouth,

59
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:04,015
and once you've gotten small enough,
I'll crunch down and chew you up!

60
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:23,325
My fault, my fault!
Still, too bad for you, Majin Boo.

61
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:24,535
What?

62
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:36,925
This is impossible!

63
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:42,345
My appearance may have been altered,
but apparently my strength hasn't changed.

64
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:52,855
How about that? My speed is the same too.

65
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:55,815
But without arms and legs,
it's hard to stay in form.

66
00:07:55,855 --> 00:07:57,315
Okay, now what are you going to do?

67
00:07:57,355 --> 00:08:01,945
Your opponent is the strongest
hard candy in the universe!

68
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:02,865
Don't be absurd!

69
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:05,535
Even if you can move, you're
still nothing more than hard candy!

70
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:09,325
And as a hard candy, what can you do?!

71
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:11,795
Are you sure you want
to ask something like that?

72
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,505
Besides, are you sure it's not too dangerous?

73
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:16,875
Being this small, it'll be
hard for you to attack me.

74
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:20,965
Attack you? Where is the
necessity in me doing that?

75
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:25,885
I'll just catch you and drop you
into my mouth! That's all there is to it!

76
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:30,265
Is that so? Well then, by all means, here I go!

77
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:48,405
Didn't I tell you so?
My strength hasn't changed!

78
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:05,095
I'm taking a breather.

79
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:08,935
What's wrong? Weren't you
going to catch me and eat me?

80
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:11,265
If you won't come at me, then I'll go at you!

81
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,905
Now I'll eat you!

82
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,925
Damn you, whizzing around like that!

83
00:09:56,475 --> 00:09:58,235
My, my, that was inexcusable.

84
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:01,485
You wanted to eat me so badly,
I decided I would let myself be eaten,

85
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:03,695
but instead I went right through you.

86
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:17,335
What will you do now?
Shall we do this some more?

87
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,675
Return!

88
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:34,435
Huh?

89
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:36,475
That's all for the hard candy, huh?

90
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:41,855
You did what you could, but in the end, it
looks like it was impossible for you to eat me.

91
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:54,325
Thank goodness! I thought that
was going to take years off my life!

92
00:10:54,365 --> 00:10:55,495
You moron!

93
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:58,295
So long as he hasn't defeated Majin Boo,

94
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:02,215
there won't be any exceptions to the
lifespan of every living thing in the universe!

95
00:11:02,255 --> 00:11:04,835
Th-That's right...

96
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,675
How inexcusable of me!

97
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:13,515
E-Enough! We all know
quite well that you are strong!

98
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:16,595
So please, please, hurry and end this!

99
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:38,415
For a time there, I was
wondering what would happen.

100
00:11:38,455 --> 00:11:42,415
That's fine to say, now
that he's returned to normal.

101
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:46,675
What were you planning to
do if he were still a hard candy?

102
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:54,225
Well, it could be that he took into
account that this might have happened.

103
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:58,435
After all, half of him is
that fighting prodigy Vegeta.

104
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:01,565
Still, you're lucky that
Vegeta, with his high pride,

105
00:12:01,605 --> 00:12:07,565
would do as you say, and
decide to fight Majin Boo, huh?

106
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:12,155
Well, yeah! It goes without saying,
that's one of the virtues I possess.

107
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:20,625
W-Who do you think I am? I am Great
King Yama, you know! Great King Yama!

108
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:27,715
Hey, Yama! What the hell is the meaning of this?

109
00:12:30,545 --> 00:12:33,515
Oh, you're here?

110
00:12:33,555 --> 00:12:36,515
I asked you what the meaning of this was!

111
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:41,515
Don't shout like that. As you can see,
I have returned your spirit to your body.

112
00:12:41,555 --> 00:12:44,645
Of course, it is forbidden for me to do
such a thing to someone such as yourself,

113
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:45,735
who has piled up so many crimes,

114
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:48,525
but in an emergency situation
such as this, I have little choice.

115
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:51,485
What are you planning?

116
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:55,495
Wouldn't you like to fight
Majin Boo one more time, Vegeta?

117
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:56,655
What?

118
00:12:56,695 --> 00:12:58,615
As you know, Majin Boo,

119
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:02,705
whom you tried to defeat in
exchange for your own life, is still alive.

120
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:11,135
If you were to die as such,
it will be no more than a dog's death.

121
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:15,555
For a warrior as high in pride as
yourself, you couldn't bear dying so.

122
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,845
That's why I'm telling you
that I'll give you another chance.

123
00:13:18,885 --> 00:13:21,555
How about that? Won't you try?

124
00:13:36,735 --> 00:13:41,165
In order to defeat you, I'm going to
make sure you can't restore yourself,

125
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:44,415
by blowing you to tiny bits!!

126
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:18,485
You said mine was a dog's death, didn't you?!

127
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,625
H-Hey! What are you...?

128
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,805
Hey, Vegeta...

129
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:50,395
Very well! I'll do it!

130
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:53,445
This time for sure, I'm going
to kill that tubby bastard!

131
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:11,295
<i>Provoking him awkwardly</i>
<i>like that was a mistake.</i>

132
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:15,295
<i>I wonder if Kaio-sama will</i>
<i>put up the repair costs for me.</i>

133
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,775
See here, what's wrong?

134
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:04,575
Don't tell me you're thinking of ending
this before I've even gotten serious!

135
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:08,405
You're the strongest in
the universe, aren't you?

136
00:17:23,755 --> 00:17:25,465
Goku-<i>san</i>!

137
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:07,675
Th-That didn't hurt!

138
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:10,685
That doesn't appear to be the case.

139
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,185
What?

140
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:19,645
Even for you, you've taken too much damage,

141
00:18:19,685 --> 00:18:21,855
and it seems your
regeneration can't keep up, huh?

142
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:36,705
Now then, I've grown tired of messing
around with you, and it's about time I end this.

143
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:40,505
W-What did you say?!
You're going to finish me–?

144
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:42,875
Shut up and listen to me.

145
00:18:42,915 --> 00:18:46,845
You can't be so stupid as to not
realize the difference in our two powers

146
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:49,555
after I've made this big a fool of you.

147
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:52,595
I know!

148
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:06,025
Ten! I will wait until I've counted
to ten before I eliminate you.

149
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:08,525
You should pray good and hard, or whatever.

150
00:19:10,735 --> 00:19:13,705
Well, I'm starting to count!

151
00:19:13,745 --> 00:19:17,535
One...! Two...!

152
00:19:19,585 --> 00:19:24,335
Three...! If you want to rush
your death, you can come at me!

153
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:28,715
I'll wipe you out in an instant! Without a trace!

154
00:19:28,755 --> 00:19:33,555
Four...! Five...!

155
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:35,225
Six...!

156
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:40,185
<i>Damn. How could my techniques</i>
<i>be all but useless against him?</i>

157
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:45,445
<i>At this point, the only thing</i>
<i>I can do is absorb him. But how...?</i>

158
00:19:59,495 --> 00:20:01,245
<i>Is that...?</i>

159
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:08,585
<i>That's it! That's what he broke off earlier!</i>

160
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,465
Seven...!

161
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:22,515
Eight...!

162
00:20:24,475 --> 00:20:26,735
<i>So he's finally noticed it?</i>

163
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:29,485
<i>This was the whole reason</i>
<i>I cut off that tail-like thing</i>

164
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:32,865
<i>growing out of his head, after all.</i>

165
00:20:34,485 --> 00:20:38,655
<i>All right! He's letting his guard down...</i>

166
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:43,455
Nine...!

167
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:47,005
<i>Now then, just how well is this going to work?</i>

168
00:20:49,545 --> 00:20:51,545
Ten...!

169
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:56,975
Barrier!!

170
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:21,415
I did it!

171
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:30,005
No way...

172
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:36,635
I-It can't be... Goku-<i>san</i>! Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

173
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:43,345
How can this be?! He's been absorbed!
Now everything is finished!

174
00:21:56,115 --> 00:22:01,705
I did it! Serves you right, you
stupid bastard! That's for acting so big!

175
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:06,625
But now, it's all over! You rotten piece of crap!

176
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:16,715
<i>At length, even Vegetto has</i>
<i>been absorbed by Majin Boo.</i>

177
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:20,555
<i>There are no other</i>
<i>warriors that can defeat him.</i>

178
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:25,895
<i>What in the world will become of</i>
<i>Earth, and the rest of the universe?</i>

179
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:38,825
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

180
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:45,415
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

181
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:55,965
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

182
00:22:56,005 --> 00:23:02,095
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

183
00:23:02,135 --> 00:23:09,105
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

184
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:14,485
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

185
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:18,325
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

186
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:27,415
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

187
00:23:27,455 --> 00:23:28,955
<i>Even now?</i>

188
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:36,585
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

189
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:41,965
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

190
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:48,475
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

191
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:58,525
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

192
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:15,465
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

193
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:18,255
<i>Huh? What's going on?</i>

194
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:21,425
<i>Once we made our way inside</i>
<i>Boo, our merging came undone.</i>

195
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:23,465
<i>It doesn't make any difference!</i>

196
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:27,095
<i>We have to hurry up and find</i>
<i>the others that Boo absorbed!</i>

197
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:29,225
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

198
00:24:29,265 --> 00:24:33,275
<i>"A Demonic Maze!!</i>
<i>What Is There Inside Boo's Belly!?"</i>

199
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:37,025
<i>I wonder how the insides</i>
<i>of Boo's body are set up.</i>

200
00:24:37,065 --> 00:24:39,605
"Next time"
"A Demonic Maze!!
What Is There Inside Boo's Belly!?"
