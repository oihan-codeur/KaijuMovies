00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:25,375
Gohan, take Piccolo with you
and get yourselves back to Earth.

He's still barely alive.

24
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:36,395
Go home now, while I still
have some sliver of reason left!

25
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:38,225
Right!

W-What's with his transformation?

30
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:44,895
Saiyans are only supposed
to turn into great apes.

31
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:47,425
W-What does this mean?

32
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:04,915
Quickly, Gohan. If Piccolo
dies, Kami<i>-sama</i> dies too.

33
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:08,245
You must know what that would mean.

34
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:09,245
Father!

35
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:11,255
Don't concern yourself about me!

36
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,255
I will be sure to return to Earth later!

37

B-But how will you?

38
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:21,565
If we take your spaceship back...

39
00:05:21,605 --> 00:05:25,765
Don't argue! Do you want to annoy me?!

40
00:05:29,945 --> 00:05:31,775
Father...

41
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:58,465
Thank you! Thank you, Father!

42
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,375
I'll be waiting.

43
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:09,075
I'll be waiting for you to
appear in good shape, Father!

44
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:18,085
There's no way I'm letting
you get away like that.

45
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:49,415
Enough is enough, you scumbag!

46
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:58,095
You've killed so many blameless
people, one after the other...

47
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:14,445
You even killed Kuririn...!

48
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:53,445
W-Why do you have this kind of power?

49
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:02,465
Don't tell me... don't tell me you're...!

50
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:15,805
Father, I understood!

51
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:19,175
What Vegeta was saying is true, isn't it?

52
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:25,445
Father, you've become one. A Super Saiyan!

53
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:46,125
That's strange...

54
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:53,745
There aren't any malfunctions anywhere.

55
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:57,415
Aren't you done fixin' it yet?!

56
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:03,215
While we're here doin' this,

57
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:06,925
Gohan<i>-chan</i>'s growin'
more and more delinquent!

58
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:29,785
What's the matter, ol' timer?

59
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:34,915
You've got such a serious look on yer mug.

60
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:38,085
I want to go see Gohan now!

61
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:43,225
It's nothing.

62
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:46,925
I just had a strange, uneasy feeling is all.

63
00:09:46,965 --> 00:09:48,265
'Bout what?

64
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:52,895
Goku. I'm worried that as a
result of his getting so strong,

65
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:55,735
he's become a double-edged sword.

66
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,275
What're you talkin' 'bout?

67
00:09:57,315 --> 00:10:02,745
A double-edged sword can deliver
a powerful blow to an opponent,

68
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:06,585
but it can also deliver the
same kind of blow the other way.

69
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:09,455
Yeah, what about it?

70
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:17,395
What about it? Up until now, he's fought so
many powerful opponents, one after another.

71
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:20,225
As a result, he's gotten so strong.

72
00:10:20,265 --> 00:10:24,895
But supposing this Freeza guy turns
out to have the ultimate in strength...

73
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:25,895
Supposin' he does?

74
00:10:25,935 --> 00:10:31,775
As he fights against someone
his equal, Goku just might...

75
00:10:33,285 --> 00:10:38,775
Ah, on the other hand,
maybe I'm worrying unnecessarily.

76
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:56,255
I...

77
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:10,105
I am furious with you, Freeza!

78
00:13:07,605 --> 00:13:10,565
You talk like you're so self-important.

79
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:13,595
You say I've killed the blameless?

80
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:21,475
Are you trying to say that what you
Saiyans have done up until now was so right?

81
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:24,105
That's why we were destroyed.

82
00:13:25,185 --> 00:13:27,245
I'm the one who destroyed you.

83
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:30,455
All of you monkeys got on my nerves.

84
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:36,465
And now I'm going to destroy you.

85
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:40,495
Me, Freeza<i>-sama</i>?

86
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:44,565
Don't let things go to your head.

87
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:46,935
There's no way you can win.

88
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:57,105
Even supposing you were a Super Saiyan.

89
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:39,085
Father...

90
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:43,505
I ain't forgiving you, even if you apologize.

91
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:50,215
Dammit!

92
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:07,085
Y-You dodged it!

93
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,785
T-There's no way you could have!

94
00:20:27,945 --> 00:20:30,875
W-Why you...!

95
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:45,555
If only I could hit you, you'd be...!

96
00:20:52,595 --> 00:20:54,895
Hit me and see.

97
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:57,525
W-What did you...?

98
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:02,065
Mock me, will you?!

99
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,755
You can destroy whole planets,

100
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:23,355
but it seems you can't even
destroy a single man, huh?

101
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:27,925
W-Wh-What the hell are you?!

102
00:21:27,965 --> 00:21:31,595
As you are surely well aware...

103
00:21:31,635 --> 00:21:36,305
I am the Saiyan who
came from Earth to defeat you.

104
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,745
Despite my calm, quiet heart,

105
00:21:41,785 --> 00:21:46,775
I am the legendary warrior,
awakened by intense anger.

106
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:06,135
I am the Super Saiyan, Son Goku!!

107

<i>The transcendent power of a Super Saiyan!</i>

108
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:25,315
<i>Goku, now is the time to avenge everyone!</i>

109
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:47,805
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

110

111

112

<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

113

<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

118
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:32,885

121
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:44,395
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

122
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:46,565
<i>So sorry.</i>

00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:51,705
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

124

<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

125
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:13,355
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

126
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:17,365
