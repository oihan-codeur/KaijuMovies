<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:57,925
<i>Ka...</i>

17
00:01:57,965 --> 00:02:00,725
<i>me...</i>

18
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:04,465
<i>ha...</i>

19
00:02:04,505 --> 00:02:06,805
<i>me...</i>

20
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:09,135
<i>H-How can it be?!</i>

21
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,275
<i>Ha!!</i>

22
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:13,975
<i>It's the real thing!</i>

23
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:24,955
Before I am to be absorbed by you,
you have to tell me something!

24
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:27,585
What in the hell are you?!

25
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:34,005
I am Cell, an Artificial Human
born of Doctor Gero's computer!

26
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:39,735
If I merge with Artificial
Humans No. 17 and No. 18,

27
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:43,475
I will become my perfect form,
with power beyond imagination.

28
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:47,475
That is the reason I have come to this era.

29
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:50,575
<i>The surprising identity of</i>
<i>the monster Cell is revealed.</i>

30
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:56,155
<i>He must be prevented from</i>
<i>his perfect form at any cost!</i>

31
00:02:56,195 --> 00:02:58,155
My gratitude.

32
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:01,785
Thanks to you, all of the
mysteries have now been solved.

33
00:03:08,635 --> 00:03:10,905
You've been quite informative!

34
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,845
Why you...

35
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:25,575
<i>"Piccolo's Grievous Mistake!</i>
<i>Cell Turned Loose on the City!"</i>

36
00:03:38,995 --> 00:03:40,795
<i>What the hell is happening?!</i>

37
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,765
<i>What is it?!</i>

38
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:47,925
Cell, even figuring in the arm's
worth of energy you drew from me,

39
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:52,565
my power is still much greater than yours!

40
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:54,805
Get ready!

41
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:58,135
You sure thought that through.

42
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,145
To think you would pretend
you'd lost one of your arms

43
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:03,775
just to get me to talk...

44
00:05:06,985 --> 00:05:11,785
You're quite the clever one, aren't you?

45
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:14,955
That was the wisdom of the one
who used to be Kami, not my own.

46
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:17,195
What?

47
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:21,925
S-So that's it!

48
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:25,935
You're the result of Piccolo
and Kami merging together!

49
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,735
That's right.

50
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:31,775
Heh, you just now figured it out?

51
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:37,345
<i>Which means the Dragon</i>
<i>Balls have also disappeared.</i>

52
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:40,785
<i>Once dead, no one can be returned to life.</i>

53
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,625
<i>That's rather convenient!</i>

54
00:05:47,995 --> 00:05:50,355
Then it's no wonder you're so strong,

55
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:54,295
even though you still look
as if you were Piccolo Daimao.

56
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:58,795
Hmph. You still do not know my true power.

57
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:03,645
I'll show you now exhaustively
what that true power is!

58
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:30,395
There's no doubt about it,
he's merged with Kami<i>-sama</i>!

59
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,205
Who's that guy over there?

60
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,375
That's probably him!

61
00:06:40,415 --> 00:06:44,345
The monster that came out of that shell!

62
00:06:44,385 --> 00:06:47,915
<i>Trunks! What's he doing here?!</i>

63
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:52,755
<i>I get it. So then he also came</i>
<i>to this era in the time machine?</i>

64
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:02,435
<i>What a fool!</i>

65
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,565
<i>That he should be killed by me in the future,</i>

66
00:07:05,605 --> 00:07:08,595
<i>only to be killed in this era as well...!</i>

67
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:23,785
H-He's a freak!

68
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:30,925
I-Is he the one that killed
the people of Gingertown?

69
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,925
That's right. Watch out for his tail.

70
00:07:33,965 --> 00:07:37,935
The people here were all killed by it.

71
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:42,935
Why is it we feel Goku, Tenshinhan
and the other's <i>ki</i> from that guy?

72
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:44,935
I'll tell you all about it later.

73
00:07:44,975 --> 00:07:47,945
Putting him away comes first!

74
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:51,875
Put me away, you say?

75
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:56,885
You think it will be that easy?

76
00:07:56,925 --> 00:07:58,885
It s-spoke!

77
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:00,755
Under the circumstances,

78
00:08:00,795 --> 00:08:04,395
I don't think you have much chance of winning.

79
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:09,765
I certainly have no choice but
to withdraw from this situation.

80
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:11,605
I'm not letting you get away!

81
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:19,335
You can't escape by using the
sort of <i>Kamehame-Ha</i> you did before!

82
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,775
<i>Kamehame-Ha</i>?!

83
00:08:20,815 --> 00:08:24,945
How can this guy use Goku's <i>Kamehame-Ha?!</i>

84
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:27,945
Not just the <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>, Kuririn!

85
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:32,955
If I wanted to, I could probably
even form a <i>Genki Dama</i>!

86
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:34,585
I'm stunned!

87
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:36,755
He even knows my name! How?!

88
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:40,365
When I tell Goku, I'm sure he'll be surprised too!

89
00:08:40,405 --> 00:08:44,365
Oh? Son Goku is still alive, is he?

90
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,365
Of course he is!

91
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:50,205
<i>So, he's still alive...</i>

92
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:57,475
<i>It appears things are turning out slightly</i>

93
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,745
<i>different from the history I know.</i>

94
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:08,185
I will acquire No. 17 and No. 18 no matter what!

95
00:09:11,995 --> 00:09:15,965
No matter how you may try to prevent
me from becoming my perfect form,

96
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:17,365
it will come to nothing!

97
00:09:17,405 --> 00:09:20,565
Not as long as the only one that
can hope to fight against No. 17

98
00:09:20,605 --> 00:09:23,205
and the others is Piccolo!

99
00:09:25,845 --> 00:09:27,215
What?!

100
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:31,345
T-That's...!

101
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:33,185
<i>Taiyo-ken</i>!

102
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:03,615
Ah, dammit!

103
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,225
Damn!

104
00:10:24,735 --> 00:10:25,695
He's gotten away!

105
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:27,765
That bastard!

106
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:34,615
Kuririn! Wasn't the <i>Taiyo-ken</i>
Tenshinhan's technique?!

107
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:39,275
The <i>Taiyo-ken</i> isn't all that
difficult a technique! Goku–

108
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:41,785
and I can do it too!

109
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:44,785
Why, you...!

110
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:03,065
He's suppressing his <i>ki</i> dissipation!

111
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:06,175
He can even do that!

112
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:22,155
That was easy!

113
00:11:22,195 --> 00:11:24,755
I'll never be caught again!

114
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:27,595
So long as I act while controlling my <i>ki</i> like this,

115
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:30,795
there's no way they can find me!

116
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:48,685
You guys! This is dreadful!

117
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:53,855
M-Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>, Goku<i>-sa</i> is...

118
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:56,285
What? What's happened?!

119
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:58,455
Calm down, Mother!

120
00:11:58,495 --> 00:12:01,265
Everyone, just come up here!

121
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:10,305
What is it, what is it?

122
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:12,305
Just what is the matter up here?!

123
00:12:12,345 --> 00:12:14,715
Shh! Be quiet!

124
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:28,225
See that?! Goku<i>-sa</i> just smiled!

125
00:12:28,265 --> 00:12:30,055
Oh, he certainly did!

126
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,255
It's true! He smiled!

127
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:35,665
Hey, that means he's all
but recovered, doesn't it?

128
00:12:35,705 --> 00:12:38,265
It's really great!

129
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:44,075
Have you guys noticed it yet?

130
00:12:44,115 --> 00:12:47,775
His smile is different
from any ordinary smile.

131
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:53,785
It's the same as the excited one Goku
gets before he fights someone strong!

132
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:57,275
Oh! Now that you mention it!

133
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:02,255
Looks like we can count on Goku after all!

134
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:04,855
He must be anticipating
fighting the Artificial Humans,

135
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,425
and he's starting to get excited!

136
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,265
That's just like him!

137
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:10,965
Once he starts to get a little strength back,

138
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:13,235
he starts thinking of fighting
again, even in his sleep!

139
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,265
We can relax now!

140
00:13:15,305 --> 00:13:17,275
H-Hey, Yamucha?

141
00:13:17,315 --> 00:13:20,445
Right? Isn't that so, Roshi<i>-sama</i>?

142
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:22,645
Absolutely! What a guy!

143
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:24,075
Y-Yamucha!

144
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:26,315
Huh? What's wrong?

145
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:32,085
U-Uh, Chichi<i>-san</i>, I didn't mean anything by that.

146
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:38,095
I am utterly against havin' Goku<i>-sa</i>
fightin' so soon after his illness!

147
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:41,295
Mother, Yamucha<i>-san</i> didn't necessarily intend...

148
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:43,435
You hush!

149
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:47,265
There's nothin' I hate
more than the barbaric idea

150
00:13:47,305 --> 00:13:48,765
of you makin' him fight right away!

151
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:51,175
S-Sure.

152
00:13:51,215 --> 00:13:55,645
Yeah? I'm talkin' to each one of you here!

153
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:58,075
You got that?!

154
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:01,285
Y-Yes!

155
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:02,845
In that case,

156
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,325
Keep it quiet!!

157
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:25,305
"Gingertown, 50 km"

158
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:30,445
As I evade their view, I'll absorb
more and more humans' life energy,

159
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:33,045
and increase my power more and more!

160
00:14:33,085 --> 00:14:37,455
And then, once my power
exceeds No. 17 and the others,

161
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:40,325
I'll force them to merge with me!

162
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:45,365
"Welcome! Nickytown, 30 km"
My next catch is in Nickytown, is it?

163
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:10,855
Senseless idiot! You got a death wish?!

164
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:14,425
<i>What concerns me most is whether</i>
<i>or not there exists a Controller that</i>

165
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:16,655
<i>can shut down No. 17 and the others.</i>

166
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:20,425
Hey! Don't just stand there
like a moron, get out of the way!

167
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:24,365
<i>Once incapacitated, even if we</i>
<i>are talking about No. 17 and No. 18,</i>

168
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:28,105
<i>destroying them will be easy.</i>

169
00:15:30,315 --> 00:15:32,075
<i>But it's all right.</i>

170
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:35,445
<i>Such a Controller no longer exists.</i>

171
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:39,115
–What's the matter?
–What's going on out there?

172
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:45,085
Who do you think you are,
wearing that strange costume?

173
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,885
Leave him to us!

174
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:51,195
I was just getting the
urge for a little light exercise!

175
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:55,765
Hey, you deranged punk,
move it before you get hurt!

176
00:15:55,805 --> 00:15:57,635
<i>I can't count on much,</i>

177
00:15:57,675 --> 00:16:01,865
<i>but even these guys will</i>
<i>contribute some life energy.</i>

178
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:04,405
And if Piccolo and company discover me,

179
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:07,275
I'll just move on to another place!

180
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:25,295
Damn you!

181
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,925
Battle Formation!

182
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:42,875
W-What?!

183
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,655
<i>Vegeta?!</i>

184
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:55,185
<i>Then he hasn't been killed</i>
<i>by No. 17 and the others either?</i>

185
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:59,295
<i>Still, even he has a much</i>
<i>greater power than expected.</i>

186
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:06,305
<i>I'll probably have to hurry this up.</i>

187
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:18,645
Of those two guys with the mysterious,
incredibly large battle powers,

188
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:20,445
one of them has disappeared!

189
00:17:20,485 --> 00:17:23,855
H-However, one of them is still there!

190
00:17:23,895 --> 00:17:26,855
It isn't that Artificial Human No. 17 or whoever,

191
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:29,285
those guys don't dissipate the slightest <i>ki.</i>

192
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:32,625
So who the hell is it then?

193
00:17:32,665 --> 00:17:37,865
Dammit, I got careless!

194
00:17:37,905 --> 00:17:41,105
I should have beaten him easily!

195
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:43,235
Incredible!

196
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:45,135
You lousy scum!

197
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:47,275
I will absolutely not let
you become your perfect form!

198
00:17:55,725 --> 00:17:59,125
P-Piccolo! It can't be!

199
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:04,055
Vegeta!

200
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,695
D-Dad!

201
00:18:09,105 --> 00:18:13,665
Talk! What happened here?!

202
00:18:13,705 --> 00:18:17,675
Tenshinhan appears to be headed here as well.

203
00:18:17,715 --> 00:18:20,675
Once he arrives, I'll tell everyone all at once.

204
00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:24,675
Well then, beforehand,
I want you to answer me this.

205
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:27,345
Are you really Piccolo?!

206
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:30,285
How did you come to
have all that battle power?

207
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,725
Why, you!

208
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:37,325
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i> has...

209
00:18:38,335 --> 00:18:42,425
Piccolo<i>-san</i> has once
again merged with Kami<i>-sama.</i>

210
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,095
W-What's this? You merged?!

211
00:18:47,675 --> 00:18:50,065
<i>J-Just from that?</i>

212
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:52,075
<i>I'm sure the battle power I felt before</i>

213
00:18:52,115 --> 00:18:55,875
<i>was even higher than mine as a Super Saiyan!</i>

214
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:57,245
<i>Impossible!</i>

215
00:18:57,285 --> 00:19:00,685
<i>He's just a mere Namekian!</i>

216
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:05,285
He's here! It's Tenshinhan!

217
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,255
<i>What do we do?</i>

218
00:19:09,295 --> 00:19:13,995
<i>With No. 17 and No. 18, as well as No. 16...</i>

219
00:19:14,035 --> 00:19:16,265
<i>Even with all the super power I've obtained,</i>

220
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:18,265
<i>I probably can't handle them.</i>

221
00:19:18,305 --> 00:19:21,295
<i>Indeed, all we can do is defeat Cell himself.</i>

222
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:31,075
Um, Piccolo... or rather,
Kami<i>-sama...</i> or rather, um...

223
00:19:31,115 --> 00:19:35,845
What should we call you now?
Tenshinhan is here!

224
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:39,295
All right. I'll tell you everything.

225
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,295
Vegeta and Tenshinhan didn't see him,

226
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,365
but that monster that was just
here was an Artificial Human,

227
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:54,105
independently created
by Doctor Gero's computer.

228
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:56,135
What?!

229
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:46,755
Say, just so you know,
I don't like these clothes, okay?

230
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:49,855
If we come across a good city
somewhere, you've got to take us there!

231
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:52,265
I know, already.

232
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:56,265
Sure enough,

233
00:20:56,305 --> 00:21:00,465
I'll just have to go to the city
and take its citizens one by one.

234
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:04,875
I-It can't be!

235
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,715
Me and Kakarrot's cells?!

236
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:12,875
That's how it is.

237
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:15,685
In order to prevent Cell
from becoming his perfect form,

238
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,285
we have to either
seek him out and kill him,

239
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:24,325
or seek out either No. 17 or
No. 18 and kill them, either way.

240
00:21:29,805 --> 00:21:33,635
As far as I'm concerned, I think all
we can do is beat Cell while he still

241
00:21:33,675 --> 00:21:36,265
doesn't have all that much power.

242
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:44,315
<i>They dare to make a fool of me?!</i>

243
00:21:45,685 --> 00:21:52,285
<i>Everyone is easily outpacing the</i>
<i>Super Saiyan, greatest in the universe!</i>

244
00:21:52,325 --> 00:21:57,285
<i>It's pissing me off! What about you, Kakarrot?</i>

245
00:22:05,335 --> 00:22:08,305
Here, here the humans are!

246
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:13,735
You just sit tight, No. 17 and No. 18!

247
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:17,745
In just a few days, my
power will far surpass yours,

248
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:19,845
and I will absorb you!

249
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:23,315
<i>It's a bad situation, ringing of ill fortune!</i>

250
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:28,125
<i>Who can save the world from this despair?</i>

251
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:47,305
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

252
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:53,145
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

253
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:55,515
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

254
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:04,025
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

255
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:10,525
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

256
00:23:10,565 --> 00:23:14,635
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

257
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:18,135
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

258
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:20,775
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

259
00:23:22,515 --> 00:23:28,285
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

260
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:32,385
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

261
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,185
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

262
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:38,195
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

263
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:43,895
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

264
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:46,065
<i>So sorry.</i>

265
00:23:46,105 --> 00:23:51,205
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

266
00:23:53,945 --> 00:23:59,215
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

267
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:11,925
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

268
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:15,565
<i>Say, Trunks, I guess it won't</i>
<i>help to go back to Gero's lab,</i>

269
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:19,065
<i>and bust up the computer</i>
<i>that gives birth to Cell, huh?</i>

270
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:21,365
<i>No, let's destroy it anyway.</i>

271
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:24,975
<i>We must not allow Cell to be</i>
<i>born into this dimension's future.</i>

272
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,135
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

273
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:31,275
<i>"The Secret of Cell's Birth!</i>
<i>What Lies Below the Laboratory!?"</i>

274
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:34,325
<i>How exactly was Cell born?</i>

275
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:35,915
"Next time"
"The Secret of Cell's Birth!
What Lies Below the Laboratory!?"
