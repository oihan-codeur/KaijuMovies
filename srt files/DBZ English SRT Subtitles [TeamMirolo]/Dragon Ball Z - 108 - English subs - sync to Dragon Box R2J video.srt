But now, having released

the time of my revenge is again at hand.

00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,330
I will see to it that those worms
who inhabit the Earth's surface...

...experience an even greater

Yo!

27

Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

28
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,870
Quite a haul there, Gohan.

29
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,270
Yeah. Until Father comes back,

30
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,310
it's up to me to bring home dinner every day.

31
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,110
Good for you.

32
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:03,750
Even so, this is a lot of fun.
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, why don't you try it too?

33
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,130
Nah, I, uh...

34
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,620
Okay?

35
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,590
This river is full of fish!

36
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:15,430
Let's do this together, Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

37
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,030
Now, hold, on, Gohan!

38
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,740
That's not why I'm here.

39
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,440
Oh, you'll get your clothes all wet, huh?

40
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,140
No, that isn't it...

41
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,650
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, what a
great car! You bought that?

42
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,990
Well, yeah, it's not much.

43
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,320
Why not?

44
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,800
We haven't done anything in a while.
I'll hang around with you a bit.

45
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,330
Right, then!

46
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,200
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

47
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,670
Aren't you done with your errand yet?

48
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,610
Sorry, sorry! I'm coming now!

49
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,840
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, who is that?

50
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,380
Well, she's sort of, you know.

51
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,050
Maron is tired of waiting.

52
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,020
Sorry 'bout that!

53
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,080
Who is that little boy?

54
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,390
This is Son Goku's son, Gohan.

55
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,520
Her name is Maron<i>-chan.</i>

56
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,730
Son Goku<i>-san</i>?

57
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,730
Didn't I just tell you about him?
Son Goku, the master martial artist.

58
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,400
I wonder if you have.

59
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,000
Anyway, this little boy is sure cute.

60
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,510
Little one, how old are you?

61
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,010
F-Five years old.

62
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,080
You know what, Gohan<i>-chan</i>?

63
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,010
Your big brother and big sister
here are on their way to a date

64
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,750
at the Kame something-or-other House.

65
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,990
And so, we can't play
with you for a little while.

66
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,090
Sorry, okay?

67
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,320
M-Maron<i>-chan</i>! What are you...?

68
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,330
Oh, Kurin<i>-chan</i>, don't tell me
you're jealous of this little boy?

69
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:56,330
That's not it, but still...

70
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,100
Well then, one for Kurin<i>-chan</i>, too.

71
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,750
Anyways, Gohan...

72
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,080
Everyone's getting together
at the Kame House to visit,

73
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,080
since it's been so long.

74
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,080
Why don't you come too?

75
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,590
Sure, I'll go!

76
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,090
But I have to check with Mother...

77
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,090
Oh, yeah. Your mom sure is
fussy about these kinds of things.

78
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,730
Well, if she does let you, come on by.

79
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,100
Everyone will be waiting for you!

80
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,430
'Kay.

81
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,670
See you.

82
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,110
<i>That other person must be Kuririn-san's...</i>

83
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,620
Girlfriend! What do you know,
Kuririn<i>-san</i> finally found a girlfriend!

84
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,100
Father will be so surprised
when he comes back!

85
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,130
As strong as you are now, are
you still advancing your training?

86
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,940
Kami! What business do you have with me?

87
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,970
You haven't changed at all, Piccolo.

88
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,410
The reason I have appeared here...

89
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,810
...is because I'm thinking of having
you come sit on the Throne of Kami.

90
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,880
What's this?

91
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,010
My limbs are growing heavy.

92
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,680
You should be able to
serve as the Earth's Kami.

93
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,750
Both in strength and mind,

94
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,890
you are the only one there is
who can take my place.

95
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,270
I have no interest in the Throne of Kami.

96
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:56,410
Why don't you take a look around you?

97
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,250
The Demon Clan has
been becoming active lately.

98
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,750
It may be just a bad omen,

99
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,420
or something may already be happening.

100
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,450
In any case, you should get
ready for them, don't you think?

101
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,770
Piccolo...

102
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,270
Someone there.

103
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,460
That will be enough!

104
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,120
You're Garlic Jr.

105
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:14,260
It's been some time, Mister Popo.

106
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,030
Why are you here?

107
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,650
You are child of Garlic, who competed
against Kami<i>-sama</i> and Kami's throne.

108
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:37,800
But you're supposed be sealed
in your own created Dead Zone.

109
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,140
That's right.

110
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:46,640
If it hadn't been for Son Goku,
not to mention his son,

111
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,640
everything, including the eternal
life I got from the Dragon Balls,

112
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,280
would have gone according to my plan!

113
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,950
But I will come back to life
as many times as it takes...

114
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,420
...to realize my revenge against Kami.

115
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,450
I will be the absolute ruler!

116
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
C-Can't move.

117
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,780
This is one of the specialties
of the demonic Four Monarchs!

118
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,720
Be a good fellow and give up.

119
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,390
I give up.

120
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,390
Then answer my question. Where is Kami?

121
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,390
Don't know. Mister Popo really don't know.

122
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,730
Lying to us will do you no good.

123
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,000
Mister Popo not lie.

124
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,700
Worthless fool!

125
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,710
Not even your great power
will work within that light.

126
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,690
I doubt you'll be able to escape from there.

127
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,760
You get to live.

128
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,390
You won't object if I wait
here until Kami returns.

129
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,770
I'll at least let you live that long.

130
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,400
Cheers!

131
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,900
What do you know?

132
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,570
There's more to Kuririn than we thought.

133
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,740
Look at this guy!

134
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,740
He ignores his training, and
manages to find such a cute sweetheart.

135
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,740
"S-Sweetheart" is a bit strong,
I wouldn't say that just yet.

136
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,080
Oh? You mean we aren't sweethearts?

137
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,090
In that case, I could go for this guy as well!

138
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,090
Is that so?

139
00:15:39,130 --> 00:15:40,960
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow!

140
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,360
Yamucha!

141
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,690
Yamucha<i>-sama...</i>

142
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,760
J-Just kidding! Don't take it so seriously!

143
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,030
I mean, right?

144
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:51,970
Nuh uh, I was serious.

145
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,300
Oh, no!

146
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,900
Hold on, this has gone far enough.

147
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,070
Just how do you feel about Kuririn?

148
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,450
Huh? How do I feel about Kuririn<i>-chan</i>?

149
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,090
Maron doesn't know!

150
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,430
Now that I think about it, Kuririn
might be better at this than I thought.

151
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,440
I envy him.

152
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,440
We have to settle this matter now.

153
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,100
Hey, Kuririn!

154
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,110
I am your master.

155
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,080
What is the matter?
This is sort of out of the blue...

156
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,740
In other words, I'm something
of a father figure to you.

157
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,080
However, I do not remember
giving you my permission...

158
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,080
...for you to be seeing a young lady like this.

159
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,650
But sir! Didn't you just congratulate me?

160
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,650
That's right! Now you're
sounding high-handed!

161
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,320
Where's the harm in it, Master<i>-sama</i>?

162
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,460
You didn't let me finish!

163
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,660
It so happens that where this
young lady is concerned, there's–

164
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,000
Say, Turtle<i>-chan</i>, could you stop
calling me a young lady like that?

165
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,440
I have a name, it's Maron<i>-chan</i>!

166
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,540
Oh, I see.

167
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,770
Well then, Maron<i>-chan,</i>

168
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,110
as far as you're concerned,
there's one condition.

169
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,140
Condition?

170
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,780
It couldn't be...

171
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:16,720
What is it, Turtle<i>-chan</i>?

172
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:21,750
Maron<i>-chan</i>, you have to let me
Pafu-pafu your hooters, just a little bit!

173
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,060
Ow, ow ow, ow!

174
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,060
What are you thinking?!

175
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,730
Really!

176
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,430
T-That was a joke, guys! A joke!

177
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,680
I said no, an' I mean no.

178
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,350
No matter what?

179
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,250
No way. The longer you're
hangin' around Goku<i>-sa</i>'s friends,

180
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,280
the faster you get stupid.

181
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,360
How can you say that?

182
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,030
Didn't you make a promise to your Ma?

183
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,800
You said you'd make up the
studyin' you'd missed before.

184
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,730
But...

185
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,070
You've already used up your playin' time.

186
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,540
You'll study until evenin'.

187
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,450
That's a good boy. Study hard!

188
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,950
What's this?

189
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,270
Who's there?

190
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,710
G-Garlic Jr.! What are you doing here?!

191
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,080
I welcome you to my temple, Kami.

192
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,080
I had heard that you fools in the
Demon Clan were up to something,

193
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,790
but I did not think it was because
you had escaped from the Dead Zone!

194
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,120
I see your arrogant manner
of speech hasn't changed any.

195
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,500
Mister Popo! Mister Popo! Where are you?

196
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,800
Perhaps this is what you are looking for?

197
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,440
Even having successfully guarded
this temple for many hundreds of years,

198
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,810
this is how Mister Popo winds
up when matched up against me.

199
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,750
What does someone like you,
who mistakes his own level of status,

200
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,110
come to this temple for?

201
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,680
Garlic Jr.! I can't believe you
still aspire to the Throne of Kami?!

202
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,320
What do you mean, you can't believe it?

203
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,120
I will replace the likes of you,
and rule over this domain!

204
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
You insolent fool!

205
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,790
You expect me to just
surrender the Throne of Kami?!

206
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,760
Interesting.

207
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,600
You sound as if you're about to
show me what you're capable of.

208
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,470
So let's see what it is to
have the power of a Kami!!

209
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,760
What?

210
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,070
Kami! Submit, and kneel down before me!

211
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,400
I'll let you be one of my servants, if you like!

212
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,110
Don't be absurd!

213
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,020
I'm going to keep you alive for now.

214
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:46,030
After all, I need to use the Dragon Balls again.

215
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,000
T-The Dragon Balls?

216
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,230
For the time being, I'm
going to make you experience

217
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,530
all the pain and suffering I felt,

218
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,600
until I revive my father Garlic!

219
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,110
I'm sorry, Mother. I'm a bad boy.

220
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,080
Hey, cut it out, Haiya Dragon!

221
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,960
You want to come with
me to the Kame House?

222
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,460
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, we'll be right there!

223
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,040
It's here! This is it!

224
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,080
Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i>, what is it?

225
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,410
This is what my father Garlic had
taken from him by the previous Kami,

226
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,880
"Aquamist."

227
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,260
The water of oppression!

228
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:50,460
Inside this container is the Aquamist fog,
the essence of the evil in mankind's heart.

229
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,300
Anyone who inhales this mist will find
themself reborn as a Demon Clansman.

230
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,100
The world will be turned
into a hellish, demonic place!

231
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,910
And there, reigning over
it from the highest point...

232
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:06,770
...will be Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i>, yes?

233
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,510
That is correct!

234
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,410
<i>Having overtaken the Throne of Kami,</i>

235
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,380
<i>Garlic Jr. proceeds with his ambitious plan.</i>

236
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,090
<i>However, no one is yet aware of</i>
<i>the reality of what has happened!</i>

237
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

238
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

239
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,860
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

240
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,360
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

241
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,870
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

242
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

243
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

244
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,120
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

245
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

246
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

247
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

248
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

249
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

250
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,410
<i>So sorry.</i>

251
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

252
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

253
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,670
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

254
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,670
<i>Bad news! Thanks to Garlic Jr.'s weird mist,</i>

255
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,770
<i>Chichi, Old Man Turtle Hermit</i>
<i>and the others are acting strange!</i>

256
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:23,110
<i>It took quite a bit of effort</i>
<i>to find you, son of Son Goku!</i>

257
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,910
<i>How about it? Why don't you</i>
<i>come to the Heavenly Realm with us?</i>

258
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,520
<i>You're quite welcome!</i>

259
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,480
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

260
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,850
<i>"Black Mist of Terror...!!</i>
<i>Everyone Turns Demonic."</i>

261
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,030
<i>As if I would join you!</i>

262
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:38,300
"Next time"
"Black Mist of Terror...!!
Everyone Turns Demonic"
