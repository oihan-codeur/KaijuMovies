<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:24,600
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,850
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:36,610
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:43,160
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:52,040
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,540
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:04,550
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,020
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,150
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:17,520
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:26,490
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,040
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,920
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,360
<i>Looking toward the Cell Games,</i>

17
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,870
<i>the martial arts tournament</i>
<i>that Cell is holding,</i>

18
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,000
<i>each warrior is determined to train. However...</i>

19
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,370
Let's pick up your mother and go home.

20
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,750
There, we can settle down as much as we like.

21
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,050
We'll rest for three days,
then train for three days.

22
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,010
After that, we'll rest another three days.

23
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,590
And then comes the martial arts tournament.

24
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,470
S-Say, Father...?

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,350
Are you sure that's okay?

26
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,640
Will we be able to beat Cell like that?

27
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,400
Well, not to worry, not to worry.

28
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,480
Come on, let's go call your mother.

29
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:47,200
<i>Goku and Gohan try to live</i>
<i>their lives in a natural state.</i>

30
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,080
<i>Can they really beat Cell</i>
<i>in his perfect form like this?</i>

31
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,340
<i>"A Warrior's Rest...</i>
<i>The Girl, the Lies, and Gohan's Resolution."</i>

32
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,050
That was a close one, huh?

33
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,020
What are you doing, you pervert?!

34
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,310
P-Pervert?

35
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,350
Nyah!

36
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,660
I wonder what that could be.

37
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,200
Oh well... Shopping, shopping!

38
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,350
Have all the people here run away too?

39
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,510
I've been around to five places already,

40
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,720
and haven't been able to
get a bit of shopping done.

41
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,890
I can't just go taking things from
stores without telling anyone, after all.

42
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,940
I sure hope there's someone here.

43
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,190
Ah, good. There are people here.

44
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,530
Look! I'm telling you, hurry up
and give us the food and liquor!

45
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:56,540
I have nothing to give you guys.
Now go on back where you came from!

46
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,870
What? Do you mean to
defy us, Bourbon's men?!

47
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:08,050
Old man, I'm telling you, if you do as we say,
we'll let you into Bourbon-<i>san</i>'s Shelter Dome.

48
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,380
That thing won't do any good!

49
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,880
How many times do I have to
say it before you understand?

50
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,340
Um...

51
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,930
Who are you?!

52
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,600
I wanted to buy some seasoning.

53
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,730
This store doesn't have anything to sell.

54
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,230
Now go on and get out of here.

55
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,190
And yet there's so much here?

56
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:28,320
This has all been bought
up by the Bourbon estate!

57
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,740
Don't be ridiculous!

58
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,450
–What?!
–Young one, what seasonings would you like?

59
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,700
Let's see, um...

60
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,250
Old man! Why don't you
stop being so stubborn already?!

61
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,210
Everyone from around here is
cooperating to build the Shelter.

62
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,760
Cooperating, you say?!

63
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,970
After threatening the villagers
and driving them to work so hard?!

64
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,970
Apparently, we aren't going to come
to any understanding with just words...

65
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,180
Now stop that!

66
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,150
It's Cell! Cell is here!

67
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,150
What?! It can't be!

68
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,240
Cell, they say?

69
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,660
This is bad! We have to
hurry and escape to the Shelter!

70
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,450
Geezer!

71
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,910
If you want to have everything your way,
then you can just stay here and be eaten!

72
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,410
<i>Cell is in a place like this...?</i>

73
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,250
Everyone! Cell is here! It's Cell!

74
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,420
If you don't run away quick,
you'll be in big trouble!

75
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,340
You're the girl who I just...!

76
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,180
Now see here, Lime! Was that you again?

77
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,730
I told you, you cannot tell such lies!

78
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,480
Lies?

79
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,980
That's the Shelter to
protect everyone from Cell?

80
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,030
That's right.

81
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:57,610
Several hundred people from
the city have fled inside there.

82
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,700
But, why do they think it's safe around here?

83
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:06,000
They say that once Cell attacks a place once,

84
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,420
he doesn't show up there again.

85
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,710
Or so that's the worthless
rumor they seem to believe.

86
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,670
Then that means...

87
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:20,090
Yes. A little while ago,
Cell appeared in this village.

88
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:30,020
<i>I can't absorb any decent</i>
<i>life's energy in a place like this!</i>

89
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,820
This girl's parents were taken at that time.

90
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,120
Is that right?

91
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,580
Anyone who has seen that monster once

92
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,210
knows one thing right down to their souls:

93
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,210
Wherever you run, it's still all the same.

94
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,420
That thing is good for nothing
more than easing your mind.

95
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:01,220
It's like they're all fools!

96
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,220
Eight more days.

97
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,060
There isn't anyone in the
world that can beat that monster.

98
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,270
Until the world ends, we're
just trying to live here quietly.

99
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,780
Gramps, are you getting tired?

100
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,400
How about if I trade with you?

101
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,240
It's too much for you to do just yet.

102
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,490
I'll help you out.

103
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:34,580
Well then, if I can ask it of you.

104
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,510
Big Brother!

105
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,430
Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

106
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,600
Big Brother, you're such a fool!

107
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,440
You have to use an ax
to cut the firewood. Here.

108
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,190
T-That's right, huh?

109
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,800
Goku, are you really sure it's okay
to just be taking it easy like this?

110
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,970
What do you mean?

111
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,470
There's only eight days left!

112
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,680
There has to be something
you can do before then, right?

113
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,980
Watching you yawn so widely,

114
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,810
it's putting my sense of
tension through the ringer!

115
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,150
It is? Sorry.

116
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,320
You really aren't someone that gets nervous.

117
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,370
Hey, hey, you guys! Don't dawdle around!

118
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,620
We have to get all of the non-perishables
carried in here in under an hour!

119
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,210
You got that?!

120
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,170
You stupid bastards!

121
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,840
Cell hasn't shown up anywhere!
What were you thinking?!

122
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,640
Geez, you've been fooled again and again!

123
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,180
We're sorry, Bourbon-<i>san.</i>

124
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,180
When we get frightened by Cell,
there's nothing we can do...

125
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,020
I don't even want to look at your faces!

126
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,100
Get lost, right now!

127
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,030
There's no reason for that Cell
bastard to come here, is there?

128
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,200
And even if he does come,

129
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,740
as long as I'm inside this
Shelter Dome, I can relax.

130
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,910
Those of us who survive
will need power and money.

131
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,960
And I have both of them!

132
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,590
You're in a good mood.

133
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,090
If it isn't the <i>sensei</i>!

134
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,890
Is something the matter?

135
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,680
I am gratified that you have
hired me as a professional killer,

136
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,520
but I cannot stand being as bored as this.

137
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,400
As such, I wonder if there's
anyone you wish to have killed?

138
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,200
I will take care of one
person for 50 million zeni.

139
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,950
When the time comes, I will
have plenty of work for you to do,

140
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,410
Tao Pai Pai-<i>sensei</i>, the
greatest assassin in the world!

141
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,200
Is that so? That's a shame.

142
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,960
At that time, I will not
have my special discount rate,

143
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,830
so you will use up all the
money you have there in a flash.

144
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,590
T-That's okay! I still have more, you see.

145
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,800
Is that right?

146
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,120
<i>Piccolo, just you try to go even</i>
<i>one second past twenty-four hours!</i>

147
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,040
<i>I'll march right in there and chase you out!</i>

148
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,630
What's the matter, Piccolo?

149
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,800
Are you saying that you can
beat me with that level of power?

150
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,890
W-Why you...!

151
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,850
Damn...

152
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,890
I'm not done yet!

153
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,070
Hey there, young one!

154
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,570
Do you want anything
besides these seasonings?

155
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,540
I wonder where those two went.

156
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,550
Big Brother, you're a kind person, aren't you?

157
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,390
You think so?

158
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,220
I can tell just by looking at you.

159
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,140
You're definitely someone who doesn't fight.

160
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,190
But I like people who are strong. Like Gramps.

161
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,690
Like Gramps?

162
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,400
He may not look like it, but
Gramps used to be a martial arts master.

163
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,030
A long time ago, he even
entered the Tenkaichi Tournament!

164
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,030
Oh, is that right?

165
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,910
In fact, I think it would
be best if Gramps went and,

166
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,080
bam-bam, took care of Bourbon.

167
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,710
What could that be?

168
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,090
The Shelter Dome has been
completed. It has to be that.

169
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,710
Why don't we go see?

170
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,010
Mm-hmm.

171
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,060
Thanks to everyone's efforts,

172
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,560
the Shelter Dome has at last been completed!

173
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,780
It pleases me down to the bottom of my heart

174
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:39,120
that I am able to save the lives of so
many people here in this Shelter Dome!

175
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,530
How does he dare say that? All right, then...

176
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,670
It's Cell! Cell is here!

177
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,670
Lime-<i>chan</i>!

178
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,000
C-Cell?!

179
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,460
I can't be killed like this!

180
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,630
Cell is here! Run away, quickly! It's Cell!

181
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,470
Hey, close the gate, quick!

182
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,930
But there are still people out front!

183
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,850
You dumb bastard!
Who cares about them?!

184
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,860
Open up!

185
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,990
See, Big Brother?

186
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,490
He's shown his true colors now, right?

187
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,910
So, it's you!

188
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,910
You're the one who tricked
us earlier too, aren't you?

189
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,340
Hey, Bourbon! This isn't what you promised us!

190
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,840
That's right! We already paid you our money!

191
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,340
I guess you're just out of luck, huh?

192
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,590
We're what?!

193
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,310
Bourbon-<i>san</i>, please, take it easy!

194
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,230
It was just some brat who
was playing a prank on us!

195
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,190
What?!

196
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,870
Some brat playing a prank, you say?!

197
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,870
Bourbon-<i>san</i>, she's the one.

198
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,580
You're quite a dreadful little girl, aren't you?!

199
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,580
Bourbon-<i>san</i>, I have something to say.

200
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,550
Surely, it isn't good for
this girl to be telling lies,

201
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,880
but I don't think
you're in the right either.

202
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,590
Who are you, now?

203
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,880
I don't have any business with you!

204
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,720
You can't escape from Cell
inside a Dome like this. Besides...

205
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,520
Shut up! Shut up! Come on,
men, make this kid shut up!

206
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,520
Right!

207
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,570
Hey, stop that! He's just a child, you know!

208
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,900
Don't do anything cruel!

209
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,570
You shut up!

210
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,110
If you want to come inside the Shelter Dome,

211
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,320
then stop complaining about what I say!

212
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,740
Hold it!

213
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,420
Oh! Gramps!

214
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,790
I will not allow you to do
anything to those children!

215
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,420
What?

216
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,470
There's no reason to be afraid
of that old man! Give it to him!

217
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:04,300
Gramps, I'll help too!

218
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,930
No, I can take care of this alone.

219
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:07,600
You bastard!

220
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,610
Damn you!

221
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,520
How dare you do that to my partner!

222
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,620
Why, you...!

223
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,630
D-Dammit! Sensei! Tao Pai Pai-<i>sensei</i>!

224
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,920
Is there something I can do for you?

225
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,340
Sensei, the time for you to work has come.

226
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,510
That guy! Dispose of him, please.

227
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,730
Very well then, I shall put
him away with no trouble.

228
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,330
Oh, weren't you lucky to have dodged that?

229
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:12,870
Gramps!

230
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,000
Young one, if you were to fight
him, something awful will happen.

231
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,880
Leave him to me.

232
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,210
Have you realized who I am?

233
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:34,730
Sensei! Get him once and for all!

234
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,400
It may be more than you deserve,

235
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,940
but I'm going to let you
have my <i>Super Dodon-Pa</i>!

236
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,790
Die!! <i>Super Dodon-Pa</i>!!

237
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,580
Gramps!!

238
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,510
W-What?!

239
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,890
I-Impossible!

240
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,760
I will take you on now!

241
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,520
Big Brother!

242
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,060
You're an impudent little turd, aren't you?

243
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,980
Very well, I'll kill you first.

244
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,440
<i>Then again, it seems as though</i>
<i>I've met this kid somewhere before...</i>

245
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,450
Kid, what is your name?!

246
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,910
Son Gohan!

247
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,280
S-Son, you say?! Then, you must be Son Goku's...

248
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,450
Son Goku is my father!

249
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,120
What?!

250
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,920
Yow! Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

251
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,630
Now you've fallen for it!

252
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,810
What's the matter, Sensei?
Let him have it good, please!

253
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,820
That's it. I'm quitting.

254
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,990
I'm quitting as your bodyguard.

255
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,410
Farewell!

256
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,500
Tao Pai Pai-<i>sensei</i>!

257
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,800
Sensei! I'll pay you any
amount of money you want!

258
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,260
Please, do something about them!

259
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,260
You mean me?

260
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,510
Yes, I do! Don't be silly, Sensei!

261
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,160
W-What are you doing?

262
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,450
Don't you know?

263
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,160
Someone with my level of power
was able to destroy it that easily, see?

264
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,210
There's no way you could have
protected yourselves against Cell, is there?

265
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,130
Everyone, it's all right.

266
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,210
There will surely be
someone who can beat Cell

267
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,260
appearing at the martial
arts tournament in eight days.

268
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,380
Please, do not worry,
and go about your usual lives.

269
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,850
Gohan!

270
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,730
Father!

271
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,060
You never came back after you went shopping,

272
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,860
and now your mother is furious!

273
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:29,280
I forgot!

274
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,820
Here, Big Brother!

275
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,240
T-Thanks.

276
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,830
You must be this boy's father.

277
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,830
Yeah, that's right.

278
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,620
Both of you have uncommon power, huh?

279
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,210
You can tell that, Old-timer?

280
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,210
Gramps,

281
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,380
thank you very much.

282
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,220
Come visit us again.

283
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,220
Right!

284
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,220
Let's go, Gohan.

285
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,140
Right!

286
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,520
Be sure you defeat Cell for us!

287
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:04,640
You're entering, aren't you?
Into this Tenkaichi Tournament?

288
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,150
Big Brother! Bye bye!

289
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,910
<i>Eight days remain until the Cell Games are held.</i>

290
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:27,130
<i>Will Goku and Gohan be able to</i>
<i>surpass Cell's perfect form before then?</i>

291
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,690
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

292
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,530
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

293
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

294
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,410
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

295
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,880
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

296
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,010
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

297
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,510
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

298
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,140
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

299
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,650
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

300
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,740
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

301
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,570
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

302
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

303
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,250
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

304
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,420
<i>So sorry.</i>

305
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,590
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

306
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,590
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

307
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,860
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

308
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,320
<i>Hey, Kuririn, take a look.</i>
<i>This brings back fond memories.</i>

309
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,490
<i>These are pictures of when Gohan was a baby.</i>

310
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,030
<i>Oh, yeah? He sure was cute, all right.</i>

311
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:26,290
<i>What kind of a child was Gohan back then?</i>

312
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,160
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

313
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,830
<i>"Hidden Power!!</i>
<i>When Gohan Was a Baby."</i>
