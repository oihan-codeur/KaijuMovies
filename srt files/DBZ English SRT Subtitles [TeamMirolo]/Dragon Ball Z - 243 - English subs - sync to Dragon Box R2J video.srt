<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,290
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,630
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,930
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,650
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,280
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,150
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,990
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,580
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,580
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,580
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,600
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,600
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,980
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,150
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,980
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,820
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,070
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,210
<i>Goten and Trunks, having been</i>
<i>given sanctuary in Kami's palace,</i>

24
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,000
<i>finally regain consciousness.</i>

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,670
<i>The two have decided to learn Fusion,</i>
<i>a technique of unification, from Goku,</i>

26
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,380
<i>who has little time remaining in this world.</i>

27
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,400
Okay, Kibit, restore Gohan-<i>san</i>'s power.

28
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,210
<i>Elsewhere, with Kaioshin and Kibit's help,</i>
<i>Gohan narrowly escapes death,</i>

29
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,840
<i>and is revived in the Kaioshin Realm.</i>

30
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,720
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>... W-Where is this...?

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,100
Use the Z-Sword to defeat Majin Boo!

32
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,100
Knowing you, Gohan-<i>san</i>, you should
certainly be able to use that blade!

33
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,910
This blade is the Z-Sword.

34
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,380
Please, pull it out.

35
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,720
<i>Gohan challenges the</i>
<i>Z-Sword of the Kaioshin Realm,</i>

36
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,380
<i>said to be able to defeat even Majin Boo!</i>

37
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,680
<i>Will it prove to be the ultimate</i>
<i>weapon to defeat Majin Boo?</i>

38
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,860
<i>"It Came Ou~t!!</i>
<i>The Legendary Z-Sword."</i>

39
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:12,300
You know, to think that
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, who even defeated Cell,

40
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,720
couldn't stand up to that meat roll...

41
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,400
Goku is now followed by Gohan...

42
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,360
And now, you gotta be feelin'
more sorry for Chichi than ever.

43
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,540
Hey, hey, hey! Everyone has
already decided they're dead,

44
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,290
even though we haven't
even found any bodies!

45
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,290
How come?!

46
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,210
It's strange that you should
know that Gohan-<i>kun</i> has died!

47
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:06,690
Look, we know how you feel,

48
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,070
but seeing as how we feel
absolutely no <i>ki</i> from him...

49
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,410
It must be that Gohan...

50
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,040
is no longer of this world....

51
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,750
I... don't believe it...

52
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,470
I... won't believe it!

53
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,270
I absolutely won't believe such a thing!

54
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,110
<i>Gohan-kun...</i>

55
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,340
All right!

56
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:27,900
Um, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, what
happens if I pull out this, er, Z-Sword?

57
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,440
It is said that you will
obtain tremendous power.

58
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,110
Yes, maybe even enough
power to exceed Majin Boo.

59
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,660
Really?

60
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,290
You suppose that means an
incredible capacity to cut? How dreadful!

61
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:49,170
Don't you worry.
You won't be able to draw it out.

62
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:53,340
Kibit, be quiet and watch on.

63
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,800
Okay, Gohan-<i>san</i>. Give it a try.

64
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,800
Right!

65
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,140
All right...

66
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,050
...why you lousy...!

67
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:53,820
Damn! Ow, ow, ow!

68
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,400
Are you all right, Gohan-<i>san</i>?

69
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,660
It's no good, it won't even budge.

70
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,540
Okay, okay, okay...!

71
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,220
Super Saiyan, huh? Well, I think
you'll have the same results.

72
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,860
It's no use!

73
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,450
How can a human extract something

74
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,410
so many Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> have
challenged and found unable to pull out?

75
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,980
Come on out!!

76
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,780
Look! He did it!

77
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
W-What?!

78
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,670
U-Unbelievable...!

79
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,510
How do you like it, Gohan-<i>san</i>?
The Legendary Z-Sword!

80
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,490
It's remarkably heavy.

81
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,710
R-Right now... I don't feel as if
I've gotten any incredible power...

82
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,340
Is that so?

83
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:24,720
I wonder if I can really
use this to defeat Majin Boo.

84
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,510
What are you saying?!

85
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,180
The Z-Sword is the mightiest
blade ever to come to this holy region!

86
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,520
It can surely defeat Majin Boo!

87
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,730
Of course, that might be impossible
if its bearer wields it so unsteadily.

88
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,190
Until you are freely
able to handle that blade,

89
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,400
you cannot very well
challenge anyone to battle.

90
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,540
You might say that, but try
holding this for a moment.

91
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,080
It really is incredibly heavy.

92
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,790
Ready? Here.

93
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,270
See? Just like I said.

94
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,590
W-Well, I suppose that's about right.

95
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,130
What's about right?

96
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,140
Good question.

97
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,770
In any case, you must become
able to freely use the Z-Sword!

98
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,350
R-Right...

99
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,820
Now listen. Even if your Fusion
succeeds and you join together,

100
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,240
you can only stay that
way for thirty minutes.

101
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,780
After thirty minutes, you return to normal.

102
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,250
Once you return to normal, you'll be
incapable of Fusion for a little while.

103
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,330
Only thirty minutes? That's pretty tough.

104
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,300
I think that, knowing these two,
if they can just do the Fusion,

105
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,170
they'll definitely defeat Majin Boo.

106
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,430
Fusion is just that fierce.

107
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,720
Okay, first, both of you turn Super Saiyan!

108
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,520
What's wrong?

109
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,760
Uncle, what were you doing when
Papa and Gohan-<i>san</i> were getting killed?

110
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,190
I was knocked out.

111
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,020
Knocked out? You were
unconscious at the time?

112
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:31,200
Are you sure you're not just a coward, Uncle?!

113
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,030
We're not going to become
stronger by learning techniques

114
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,740
from someone who doesn't
fight, but runs away and hides!

115
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,830
W-Why you rotten...! Goku is–!

116
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,750
It's okay, Piccolo.

117
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:51,260
I really am a coward. Unfortunately,
I ain't able to beat Majin Boo.

118
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:59,100
But even if I am a coward, I can
still teach you this Fusion technique.

119
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:07,570
If you really want to avenge
Vegeta and Gohan, this is the only way.

120
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,230
–What should we do?
–Even so...

121
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,030
Here I am again!

122
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:22,250
People of the Earth!
It's Madoshi Babidi and Majin Boo!

123
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,750
This time we've found a
city much larger than before!

124
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,960
This place is going to be wiped out!

125
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,550
That is, unless Ma Junior, Trunks, and Goten,

126
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,930
the three of you come here immediately!

127
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,110
Hey, this image, isn't this our city?!

128
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,940
No mistake about it! It's this city!

129
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,110
L-Look! O-Over there!
Majin Boo and him are there!

130
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,510
H-He's talking about us!

131
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:16,300
Trunks-kun, close your eyes and watch!
You can see Boo and him!

132
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,010
Don't look! You're better off not seeing!

133
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:26,770
Well, well, there's still no word
from those people themselves,

134
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,150
or from anyone else.

135
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,150
What a predicament! The casualties
are only going to increase!

136
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,700
I know, last time it was hard
candies, so... hmm, this time,

137
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,620
turn them all into chocolate
or whatever and eat them!

138
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:47,660
All right, Majin Boo, turn every
last person in this city into chocolate!

139
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,900
You turn into chocolate!

140
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,060
I-It can't be!

141
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,150
The townspeople, they all became choco!

142
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,400
"In Training"

143
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,080
Hey, isn't that Policious City?

144
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,540
No doubt about it! H-How can it be?!

145
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,040
What are you so upset about?

146
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,630
One who presumes himself to be a martial
artist is not perturbed by things such as this.

147
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,470
Besides which, you should be training!

148
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,810
Do not think about anything
else, and focus your mind!

149
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,140
Right!

150
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,280
Humans unmistakably can fly,

151
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,570
our bodies have just forgotten how
to use the power that allows us to.

152
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,950
Otherwise, Videl and those
others would not be able to fly!

153
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,580
All right, do it!

154
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,800
Now, let go!

155
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:13,140
Awake, my body, and grant me newfound power!

156
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,510
T-Terrible news, Mister Satan!

157
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:50,050
Fool! Haven't I always said that
during training, no one is permitted in?!

158
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,270
P-Pardon me. But there's terrible news!

159
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,330
W-What's this?

160
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,500
Our hero, Mister Satan! Please
defend the peace of our Earth!

161
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,750
You're up, Mister Satan! Put Majin Boo away!

162
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,880
Th-That's easy for you to tell me...

163
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,430
–Our Mister Satan!
–Satan, please!

164
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,260
Champion of justice, our hero!

165
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:10,600
Satan! Satan! Satan!

166
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,810
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to worry about!

167
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:20,270
Hiding nothing, I am currently training
to develop a new finishing technique!

168
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,270
As soon as the training
is finished, I, Mister Satan,

169
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:28,990
will punish that ridiculous Majin Boo
with the new finishing technique!

170
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,500
<i>W-What do I do?!</i>

171
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,290
'urp...!

172
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,450
W-Why those...!

173
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,330
Apparently, Majin Boo is full
from all that choco just now.

174
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,830
And so, we go on to the next city.

175
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,880
Let's see, which way should we go this time?

176
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,260
Babidi! Majin Boo!

177
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,390
You hear me?! This is Trunks!

178
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,850
This is Goten!

179
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:38,850
Well, well... At last, contact
from the people themselves.

180
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,350
Listen! Right now it's impossible,

181
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,400
but very soon, we are
absolutely going to slaughter you!

182
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,230
Absolutely!

183
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,400
Hey, stop speaking to Babidi!
He'll find out about this place!

184
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,410
Hey, where are you?
Where did you go? Come out here!

185
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,030
Are you hiding, you cowards?!

186
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,540
Let's do this Fusion training properly!

187
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,720
<i>Goten and Trunks resolve to master Fusion.</i>

188
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:19,260
<i>At last, the training to</i>
<i>wipe out Majin Boo begins!</i>

189
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,950
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

190
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,540
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

191
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,090
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

192
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,220
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

193
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:09,230
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

194
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:14,610
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

195
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,450
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

196
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:27,540
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

197
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,090
<i>Even now?</i>

198
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:36,720
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

199
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,100
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

200
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:48,600
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

201
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:58,650
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

202
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,880
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

203
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,180
<i>This ain't good.</i>

204
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,430
<i>The Capsule Corporation's</i>
<i>location has been revealed to Babidi.</i>

205
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,560
<i>Son-kun, if the Dragon</i>
<i>Radar gets destroyed now,</i>

206
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,730
<i>the people who were killed</i>
<i>won't ever come back to life.</i>

207
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,770
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

208
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,230
<i>"Metro West is Targeted!</i>
<i>Stop, Majin Boo!!"</i>

209
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:36,820
<i>We have to stop Boo somehow,</i>
<i>while the Radar is being fetched.</i>

210
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,740
"Next time"
"Metro West is Targeted!
Stop, Majin Boo!!"
