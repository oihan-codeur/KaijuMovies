<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:56,700
<i>Goku has finally won against Freeza.</i>

17
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,070
<i>However, the time of Planet</i>
<i>Namek's explosion has come!</i>

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,410
I will live too. You'll see.

19
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,880
I'm the greatest in the universe!

20
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,420
I am Freeza, Emperor of the Universe!

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,760
You must be killed by me!!

22
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,730
You stupid bastard!!

23
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,660
<i>"Planet Namek's Great Explosion!!</i>
<i>Goku Disappears into Space."</i>

24
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,540
Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

25
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,200
What in the world has happened?

26
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,870
What about Goku?

27
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,740
What about Freeza?

28
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,740
Freeza has died.

29
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,020
Goku shared some of his own <i>ki</i>
with Freeza as he pleaded for his life.

30
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,860
He gave him a chance to live!

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,740
Freeza made use of it to attack Goku.

32
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,370
That rotten Freeza!

33
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:17,870
At that point, Goku had no
choice but to finish him off.

34
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,510
Then Goku has completely won!

35
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:27,220
Mm hmm. After becoming a Super
Saiyan, Freeza was no match for Goku.

36
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,750
He did it!

37
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,560
<i>So a Super Saiyan is as incredible as all that?</i>

38
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,690
<i>Now Goku's strength is</i>
<i>the greatest in the universe!</i>

39
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:44,030
<i>Somehow, it seems like he's become</i>
<i>a person from some distant world.</i>

40
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,740
However... however...

41
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,710
His being the greatest in the
universe may last for only a moment.

42
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,710
Which means...?

43
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:58,410
The explosion of Planet Namek is closing in!

44
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,050
He doesn't likely have enough time
to reach the spaceship he came in.

45
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:10,390
He's headed toward
Freeza's nearby spaceship,

46
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,100
but it appears to be broken down.

47
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:21,900
H-Hey! This is Goku we're talking about!

48
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,040
He'll get through this somehow!

49
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,710
I mean, up until now, he's
gotten out of so many pinches!

50
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,120
On top of that, Goku is
now a Super Saiyan! Right?

51
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,720
Y-Yeah...

52
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,750
Goku, hurry! In any case, hurry!

53
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,770
All right...

54
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,390
<i>Please, let me be in time!</i>

55
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,730
<i>This ain't it!</i>

56
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:30,740
<i>Where is the control room?!</i>

57
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,880
All right, this is good!

58
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,050
It's just about the same as
the spaceship I came here in!

59
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,750
Where's the startup switch?!

60
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,060
It's this one!

61
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,400
Start!

62
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,730
Please, start for me!

63
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,080
Start! Damn this thing! Start!

64
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,770
Start! Start! Start!!

65
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,720
H-How can this be?! How can it...?!

66
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,720
What is the matter, Kaio<i>-sama</i>?!

67
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,690
Freeza's spaceship, the last
thing we were depending on...!

68
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,990
It cannot fly at all now!

69
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,360
In that case, what about Goku?!

70
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,200
He cannot return!

71
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,230
He can only share in the
same fate as Planet Namek!

72
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,730
<i>It's going to explode...</i>
<i>Planet Namek is going to explode...</i>

73
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,740
Damn it to hell!!

74
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,410
I-I can't watch!

75
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,050
Goku!

76
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,060
Goku... Don't you die!

77
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,330
Don't you die!!

78
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:58,010
Damn it all to hell!

79
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,290
Damn it all to hell!

80
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,530
Kaio<i>-sama...</i>

81
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,730
Is Goku really...?

82
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,090
As I feared, it was no use.

83
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,530
Damn it, man...

84
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,560
<i>Goku!</i>

85
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,910
<i>Then he's died after all?</i>

86
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,370
What a pity.

87
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:45,380
We'll have to inform Goku's son
on Earth that his father has died.

88
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,410
It's going to be hard.

89
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,890
If we could have Bulma<i>-san</i> tell him...

90
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,220
I suppose so.

91
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,230
Please, let me be the one to tell her.

92
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,930
Okay, Yamucha.

93
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,570
And so, if you would.

94
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,080
Right.

95
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,380
Bulma!

96
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,750
Bulma... Bulma, can you hear me?

97
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,420
Can you hear me, Bulma?

98
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,890
It's me, Yamucha!

99
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,330
Yamucha? Huh?

100
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,400
That's right, it's Yamucha.

101
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,880
Through Kaio<i>-sama</i>, I'm
speaking directly into your mind.

102
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,880
Into my mind?

103
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,550
Really?

104
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:53,380
What is it, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

105
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,880
By any chance, is it from Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

106
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,550
That's what he said.

107
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,890
You sure knew what it was, huh?

108
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,260
Yamucha's the one talking right now.

109
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,930
So how are you doing, Yamucha?

110
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,930
Mm hmm. I am dead, but if
you can say I'm fine, then I'm fine.

111
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,230
Never mind that, I want you
to settle down and listen to me.

112
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,110
It's about Goku.

113
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,580
Goku defeated Freeza. A-And then...

114
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,910
Say, say, listen everyone, listen!

115
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,180
Goku put Freeza down, he says!

116
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,390
Really, Bulma<i>-san</i>?! He did it!

117
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,900
<i>So he did, huh? Son finally did it!</i>

118
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,870
Father won!

119
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:49,200
He won! He won!

120
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,540
<i>Kakarrot beat Freeza?</i>

121
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:57,550
Just listen quietly for me! That's not all!

122
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,920
After he defeated Freeza, Goku...

123
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,390
...tried desperately to take off,

124
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,090
but he didn't make it before
Planet Namek exploded and died.

125
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,190
Say, hold on, everyone!

126
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,030
Son<i>-kun</i> died when Planet
Namek exploded, he says.

127
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,870
Quite a shock, huh?

128
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,370
You stupid twit!

129
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,340
How can you say it like that?!

130
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,870
Think for a moment about Gohan's feelings!

131
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,080
Goku cannot return again!

132
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,880
You don't know anything!

133
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,220
We have the Dragon Balls here,
the ones from Planet Namek!

134
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,350
Planet Namek's Dragon Balls came
to Earth together with its people, see?

135
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,720
You'll be so surprised!

136
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,230
They say the Dragon Balls from Planet Namek

137
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,400
can bring people back to
life any number of times!

138
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:01,580
In other words, Son<i>-kun</i>, Kuririn<i>-kun,</i>
and Chaozu<i>-kun</i> can be brought back to life!

139
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,580
R-Really?!

140
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,420
What's the matter, Yamucha?

141
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:13,890
Everyone can return to life! Chaozu, you too!

142
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,560
Really?

143
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,160
It is the folks on Earth
that don't know anything.

144
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,570
Certainly Chaozu can be brought
back to life with the Namek Dragon Balls.

145
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,570
But as for Goku and Kuririn...

146
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,210
What about Goku and Kuririn, Kaio<i>-sama</i>?!

147
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,880
The Dragon Balls return people
to life at their point of origin!

148
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,220
Which means...?

149
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,550
Goku and Kuririn will
return to life on Planet Namek.

150
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,090
However, Planet Namek is no longer there!

151
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,630
There's just the vacuum of space.

152
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,610
The moment they return to life,
death awaits them again.

153
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:15,850
Kaio, with your power, isn't there anything...

154
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,150
isn't there anything that can be done?

155
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,520
There is nothing that can be done.

156
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,550
That isn't my area.

157
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,200
What's the matter, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

158
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:37,870
S-Son<i>-kun...</i> can't come back, they said.

159
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,370
Even if they did return to life,

160
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,750
they'd die immediately,
since Planet Namek isn't there.

161
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,750
T-That can't be!

162
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,400
This is great! It's turning
out just as I was hoping!

163
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,710
Freeza is gone. Kakarrot is gone.

164
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,080
I'm the one who is greatest in the universe!

165
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,850
I will rule over the entire universe!

166
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,890
Father is sure to... sure to return to Earth!

167
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:30,420
Are you still saying that, kid?
Your pop has died!

168
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:38,070
Bow your head to me now.

169
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,870
You are a child of the warrior Saiyan race.

170
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,210
You're supposed to have
unfeeling blood flowing through you.

171
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,080
You can be my underling if you like.

172
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,520
Father is sure to come back!

173
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,390
Just keep on spouting that forever!

174
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,760
C-Cut that out!

175
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,240
Are we going to go at it, kid?

176
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,780
Father will surely... surely be coming back!

177
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,520
I thought of you as a kid,
so I took it easy on you,

178
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,060
but you had to raise it to this!

179
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,070
You're sure you're ready for this?

180
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:39,080
Whoa, it's too early to die just yet!

181
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,870
Gohan<i>-kun</i> will be killed!

182
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,400
Gohan<i>-san</i>!

183
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,440
You wretched kid!

184
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:34,910
Stop, Vegeta!

185
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:46,590
F-Father... Father is
absolutely coming back...!

186
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,430
Absolutely!

187
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:54,260
Your optimism makes me sick!

188
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,440
Gohan<i>-san</i>! Shake it off!

189
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,440
Father...

190
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,780
Son<i>-kun...</i>

191
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,750
Son<i>-kun</i>!!

192
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,230
<i>Goku has disappeared, together</i>
<i>with the destruction of Planet Namek.</i>

193
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:29,760
<i>What will the world be like without Goku?</i>

194
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

195
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

196
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

197
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

198
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

199
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

200
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

201
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

202
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

203
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

204
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

205
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

206
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

207
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

208
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

209
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

210
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

211
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,000
<i>Polunga, thanks and all,</i>
<i>but I don't need your help.</i>

212
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,510
<i>I'll be coming home on my own soon.</i>

213
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,940
<i>Son-kun, cut it out already!</i>

214
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,780
<i>Kuririn, Yamucha and the others</i>
