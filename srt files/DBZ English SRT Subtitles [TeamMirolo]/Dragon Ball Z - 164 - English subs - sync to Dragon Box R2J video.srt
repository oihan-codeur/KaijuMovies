<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:24,515
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:29,765
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:36,525
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:43,115
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:51,955
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:55,455
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,495 --> 00:01:04,465
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,505 --> 00:01:07,975
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:14,055
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:17,475
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:26,405
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:29,995
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:36,835
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,795
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,095 --> 00:01:53,685
<i>At last, Cell has achieved his perfect form.</i>

17
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:58,685
<i>His hidden powers overwhelmed even Super Vegeta.</i>

18
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:03,355
Trunks! It's now or never!

19
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:07,115
Now's the time to become
that drastic Super Saiyan!

20
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:18,995
I will... kill you, Cell!

21
00:02:19,035 --> 00:02:24,755
The time when I will prove the
strength of this perfect form has come.

22
00:02:54,155 --> 00:03:00,995
<i>"A Future of Despair!!</i>
<i>Trunks, the Man Who Lived Through Hell."</i>

23
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:50,175
<i>That ki is so large it's terrifying...</i>

24
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:20,495
It's Trunks' <i>ki.</i>

25
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:25,295
Awesome... And we've
already gotten pretty far away.

26
00:04:25,335 --> 00:04:28,505
Those Saiyans really are frightful!

27
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,765
Now we're havin' an earthquake!

28
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,575
This is awful.

29
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,035
Pardon me a moment...

30
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,695
What are you doin', you nasty old man?!

31
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:16,265
An incredible <i>ki</i>... I-Is this...?

32
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,425
It's Trunks' <i>ki.</i>

33
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:24,935
It's more awesome than
Vegeta's. Far more awesome!

34
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:27,315
He'll be able to defeat Cell like this!

35
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:35,615
An admirable power.

36
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:40,285
Certainly one incomparable
to that of your father, Vegeta's.

37
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:45,745
I will no longer allow you
Artificial Humans to have your own way!

38
00:05:46,745 --> 00:05:49,465
I will not let you create that miserable future,

39
00:05:49,505 --> 00:05:52,085
and allow that hell to be repeated!

40
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:04,895
It's the Artificial Humans!

41
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:06,645
The Artificial Humans have come to attack us!

42
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:08,515
It's No. 17 and No. 18!

43
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,255
Destroying cities sure is fun, huh?

44
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:38,675
Take this city...

45
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:41,675
how many hundreds of years
did it take to become like this?

46
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:44,685
But it only takes a moment to destroy it.

47
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:47,855
Even so, it's getting a bit dull.

48
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:51,185
Isn't there anyone with a
little backbone to face us?

49
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:56,445
The Artificial Humans were strong. Too strong.

50
00:06:56,485 --> 00:07:01,695
The warriors who stood against
them were all killed with ferocious power

51
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,575
Including my father, Vegeta...

52
00:07:13,335 --> 00:07:15,005
Dammit!

53
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,595
Piccolo-<i>san</i> too...

54
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,775
Kuririn-<i>san</i> too...

55
00:07:50,075 --> 00:07:56,215
As well as Tenshinhan-<i>san,</i>
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, Yajirobe-<i>san...</i>

56
00:07:56,255 --> 00:08:00,255
Everyone... Everyone was done in.

57
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:03,925
Only myself and Gohan-<i>san</i> remained.

58
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:16,275
Oh? Son Gohan, is it?

59
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:20,065
You guys aren't going to get your way forever!

60
00:08:21,905 --> 00:08:25,245
Vegeta and Piccolo, who we also defeated,

61
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:28,785
tried the same kind of posturing, you know.

62
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:34,875
Trunks, stay back!

63
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:35,915
Right!

64
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:56,015
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

65
00:09:02,695 --> 00:09:05,945
How dare you cut my precious hair!

66
00:09:22,885 --> 00:09:25,305
Dammit...!

67
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:26,715
Die!!

68
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:31,475
<i>Masenko</i>!!

69
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:52,915
Dammit! Where are they?!

70
00:09:57,245 --> 00:09:59,875
In that case, we'll have
to comb the area for them!

71
00:09:59,915 --> 00:10:02,005
We'll just destroy one place after another!

72
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,215
Gohan-<i>san...</i>

73
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,885
It's no good.

74
00:10:10,925 --> 00:10:12,765
We're just no match for them!

75
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,055
Sure is aggravating, huh?

76
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:19,065
<i>If only Father,</i>

77
00:10:19,105 --> 00:10:23,195
<i>who died of that heart disease,</i>
<i>was still alive at times like these...!</i>

78
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,235
<i>Knowing Father,</i>

79
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:28,695
<i>he would have fought courageously,</i>
<i>without hesitation, at any time!</i>

80
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:32,035
<i>I want to be strong, like Father!</i>

81
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:33,205
Gohan-<i>san...</i>

82
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:44,585
After that, the battle with the
Artificial Humans continued...

83
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:49,255
And then, in time, Gohan-<i>san</i> was killed.

84
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:52,095
I became the only warrior remaining.

85
00:10:52,135 --> 00:10:54,845
Because of just two Artificial Humans,

86
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:57,475
the future had become hell.

87
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:06,365
I won't let that miserable
future happen again! Cell!

88
00:11:06,405 --> 00:11:10,075
For the future of the Earth, I will kill you!

89
00:11:32,255 --> 00:11:34,885
Good, good! Better and better!

90
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,435
Such marvelous power!

91
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:42,105
You might have even
surpassed me. I am pleased!

92
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:49,985
I would bet that even Doctor
Gero-<i>sama</i> is happy because of you.

93
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:55,615
After all, we have finally come across
an opponent to test my ultimate power.

94
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:38,495
Cell! I am Doctor Gero.

95
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:41,875
You are the ultimate artificial human,

96
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:44,335
cultured by my computer from the cells...

97
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:47,715
...of martial arts experts that I have gathered.

98
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:51,885
I look forward to watching
as you become complete–

99
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:59,515
the ultimate Artificial Human,
with terrible, mind-boggling powers!

100
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:36,715
Cell, you will absorb the energy
of the living, and continue to grow.

101
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:39,055
And then, by absorbing No. 17 and No. 18,

102
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:42,435
two of the Artificial Humans that I have created,

103
00:13:42,475 --> 00:13:44,685
and becoming your perfect form,

104
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:50,315
you can obtain ultimate power,
and be invincible in this world!

105
00:15:11,895 --> 00:15:14,735
W-What is that monster?!

106
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:33,085
Get him! Capture him!

107
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:07,615
Run!

108
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,125
Help me–

109
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:44,285
<i>Doctor Gero's research was perfect.</i>

110
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:50,455
<i>I, having been created from the cells</i>
<i>of the best of the martial arts experts,</i>

111
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:51,875
<i>was unopposed.</i>

112
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:57,715
<i>However, I did not come across No. 17 or No. 18,</i>

113
00:16:57,755 --> 00:17:00,295
<i>whom I was searching for, anywhere.</i>

114
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,915
When I came forth upon the Earth,

115
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:40,295
No. 17 and No. 18, whom I was seeking out,

116
00:17:40,335 --> 00:17:42,585
were no longer around.

117
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:45,885
Apparently, you had defeated them.

118
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:54,855
However, thanks to your time machine,

119
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,025
I was able to return into the past like this,

120
00:17:57,065 --> 00:18:00,275
meet the No. 17 and No. 18 of this time,

121
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:02,985
and become my perfect form.

122
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:08,905
At last, my wish has been granted!

123
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:30,345
I would like to test the power
of this perfect form right away!

124
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:35,895
That's just what I was hoping for, Cell!

125
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:40,895
I will now show you the
true power of the Saiyans.

126
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:39,745
What?!

127
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:03,315
W-What are those guys?!

128
00:20:03,355 --> 00:20:05,815
I can't see their movements at all!

129
00:20:08,645 --> 00:20:11,485
I will kill you!

130
00:20:11,525 --> 00:20:15,445
I will not let you Artificial Humans
have your way with the Earth!

131
00:21:31,605 --> 00:21:36,075
Indeed, you certainly do have marvelous power.

132
00:21:36,115 --> 00:21:39,695
You have well surpassed me.

133
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:47,705
However, you cannot beat me like this.

134
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:49,255
Absolutely not!

135
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:02,975
Speak hollow boasts to me, will you?

136
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:06,975
I see...

137
00:22:11,315 --> 00:22:16,275
<i>The clash between Trunks,</i>
<i>with his absolute self-assuredness,</i>

138
00:22:16,315 --> 00:22:18,905
<i>and Cell, with the tenacity of his perfect form,</i>

139
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:20,285
<i>has gotten underway.</i>

140
00:22:20,325 --> 00:22:23,915
<i>However, why in the world is it...</i>

141
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:26,915
<i>...that Cell is poised to the</i>
<i>point of being frightening?</i>

142
00:22:44,185 --> 00:22:48,185
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

143
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:54,025
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

144
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:56,405
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

145
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:04,865
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

146
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:11,415
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

147
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:15,505
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

148
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:19,005
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

149
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:21,635
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

150
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:29,145
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

151
00:23:31,395 --> 00:23:33,275
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

152
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:35,065
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

153
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:39,115
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

154
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:44,785
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

155
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:46,955
<i>So sorry.</i>

156
00:23:46,995 --> 00:23:52,085
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

157
00:23:54,835 --> 00:24:00,085
