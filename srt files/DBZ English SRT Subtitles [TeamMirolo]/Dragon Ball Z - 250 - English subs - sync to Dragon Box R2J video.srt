00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,070
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,750

<i>Using every means of destruction,</i>

24
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,070
<i>Majin Boo has indiscriminately attacked</i>

25
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,900
<i>and destroyed cities and</i>
<i>villages all over the world.</i>

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,330
<i>Elsewhere, Goku had placed</i>
<i>his hopes with Goten and Trunks,</i>

27
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,500
<i>and returned back to the Other World.</i>

28
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,970
<i>There, Goku was told by Great King</i>
<i>Yama that Gohan is still alive.</i>

29
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,400
<i>Sensing Gohan's ki, Goku</i>

<i>There, he was reunited with Gohan,</i>
<i>Kaioshin, and the resurrected Kibit.</i>

31
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:03,590
<i>"You're Kidding, Right!?</i>
<i>The Z-Sword is Broken."</i>

32
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,390
–Fu-sion!
–Fu-sion!

33
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,930
Once again!

34
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,770
–Fusion Ha!
–Fusion Ha!

35
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,350
No, no!

36
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,350
How many times do I have
to say this before you get it?!

37
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,850
Match your timing together!

38
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,570
Listen! Fusion is a merging technique.

39
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:29,780
No matter how well you learn the pose,
unless you make your breathing as one,

40
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,780
you will not master Fusion.

41
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,790
Yeah, but Goten's being too slow!

42
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,960
Am not! Trunks-<i>kun</i> is too fast!

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,870
–What was that?!
–Oh, yeah?!

44
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,760
Enough already! We don't
have any time for this!

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,010
If you want to fight, you can do it all
you like, after you defeat Majin Boo!

46
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,860
All right. Let's continue training!

47
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,900
Right...

48
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,700
Fusion Ha!

49
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,320
Once again!

50
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,700
Fusion Ha!

51
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,870
Fusion Ha!

52
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,960
My, my, and they were
doing so well with it, too.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
Yoink!

54
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,800
Okay...

55
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,390
So do you really suppose
they'll be able to merge together?

56
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,780
It's okay, they'll do it!

57
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,030
There's no reason Son-<i>kun</i> would lie to us.

58
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,240
Awesome, awesome!

59
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:41,750
You've done good to be able to wield it
that well in just a day! Incredible, Gohan!

60
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,250
Indeed, quite wonderful, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

61
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,140
So, I'm sure it's awfully sharp, that Z-Sword.

62
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,720
Say, let's test it out a bit!

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,260
Very good!

64
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,930
Let's see... okay...

65
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,480
First will be this rock.

66
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:25,670
All right, here goes, Gohan!
Try cutting this clean in half!

67
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,830
I'm sure it will cut right through it like tofu!

68
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,500
If I know the Z-Sword here!

69
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,650
You did it, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

70
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,320
Yes...

71
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:04,040
Wow! That's awfully sharp!

72
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,670
Goku-<i>san...</i>

73
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,710
Let's try something even harder this time.

74
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,340
Goku-<i>san</i>, here.

75
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,100
Oof... what's this?

76
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,770
This is <i>katchinko</i>, said to be
the hardest metal in the universe.

77
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,110
Whew, that's hard!

78
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,280
As long as you're doing this, try it with that!

79
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,700
That's great!

80
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,080
All right, Gohan, here goes!

81
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Leave it to me!

82
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,620
Ready, set...

83
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,040
Go!

84
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,240
Y-You're kidding! It broke!

85
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,080
I-I-It can't be! Th-Th-The Z-Sword!

86
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,330
Th-The strongest blade ever...!

87
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,670
Look at that! Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, this is your fault

88
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,720
for telling us to try testing it
against something that hard.

89
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,640
B-But, it's said that whoever takes it in hand

90
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,140
will hold the greatest power in the world!

91
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,600
Th-Th-The Z-Sword was the
legendary blade of this holy region!

92
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,480
It appears it was something
of an exaggerated legend, huh?

93
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,410
B-But still, because of it, my
strength has risen considerably.

94
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,160
That Z-Sword was incredibly heavy, after all.

95
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:16,420
See? Perhaps it meant that if you
came to be able to use that sword,

96
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:21,260
you would have the greatest
power in the world, maybe.

97
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,260
Th-That's it! If you've gotten that
much power in your regular state,

98
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,310
once you turn Super Saiyan, you should
experience a considerable power-up!

99
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:44,280
That's it! That's the legendary
greatest power in the world!

100
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,040
But whether that power is greater
than Majin Boo's... I don't know...

101
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,000
B-But Goku-<i>san</i>, there isn't any other way.

102
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,540
That's not so-o!

103
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,390
Huh? What's with the old guy?

104
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,190
U-Um, and you are...?

105
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,020
Me?

106
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,030
You'll be so surprised
to hear this! I'm, y'know...

107
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,030
Who am I, who am I, but your, y'know...

108
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:33,410
15-generation-previous, y'know, Kaioshin here!

109
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,040
F-Fifteen-generations previous?!

110
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,090
K-Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?!

111
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,460
U-Um... Great King Yama-<i>sama</i>?

112
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,510
"Great King Yama-<i>sama"</i>
What is it?

113
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,850
Er, can we please ask you
to allow us to go home, oni?

114
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,260
What?!

115
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,350
We have been working so
long now without any rest,

116
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,230
and hardly any time for meals.

117
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:43,820
If this keeps up, I fear we will find
it hard not to get in line ourselves.

118
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,490
I'd like to get some rest right along with you,

119
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:50,240
but we can't very well leave
these dead people here, right?

120
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,830
Oni...

121
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:55,500
Passing judgement on these lost dead

122
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:01,040
and then leading them to the
world they are to proceed to is our duty!

123
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,840
G-Great King Yama! This is terrible!

124
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,210
What's wrong?!

125
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,680
A-Another million-and-a-half
dead have just arrived from Earth!

126
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,680
What did you say?!

127
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,310
Just what in hell is happening on Earth?

128
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,690
Fifteen-generation-previous–

129
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,860
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?!

130
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,780
That's right.

131
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:35,950
Long, long ago, y'know, there was this
terribly strong, y'know, bad guy, y'know.

132
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:43,710
Well, not so bad as this Majin Boo now.

133
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,220
So this guy, y'know, sealed
me up inside that sword, here.

134
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,930
I'm sure, y'know, he was all nervous by how
fearsome I am, y'know, so he did it. Mm hmm.

135
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,610
Finally, I've been allowed out!

136
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,780
He doesn't look like that
awesome an old guy. Right?

137
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,110
Not really...

138
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,820
Say, should we put him to the test?

139
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,080
Huh? I'm not too sure...

140
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,720
–H-Honorable forefather!
–A-Are you all right?!

141
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,720
–Please, shake it off!
–Honorable forefather!

142
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,690
You ignorant fool!

143
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,190
What are you doing?!
You dung dangle! You tinkle trickle!

144
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,820
Dimwit! Scum! That you could
do that to a majestic Kaioshin!

145
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,780
And you have an outie, too!

146
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,620
He's just a blowhard old man after all.

147
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,790
He's not that strong at all, is he?

148
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:07,790
It wasn't my power, y'know,
that made my opponent nervous!

149
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:11,800
It was the fearsome ability
I have that he was nervous about!

150
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,260
–Fearsome...
–Ability?

151
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,260
What's that?

152
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:23,850
Nyah nyah nyaaaah!
I'm not telling you any mo-ore!

153
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,320
I guess there ain't any choice.

154
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,820
If that's the case, I'll give you a dirty
book next time I see you, so tell us!

155
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,240
F-Father!

156
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,830
Goku-<i>san</i>! How could you say that?!

157
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,080
Hmph! I don't have to see
any book! With my godly eyes,

158
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,670
I can see gals bathing and change
their clothes and stuff just fine, you know!

159
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,540
H-Honorable forefather!

160
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:55,720
Well, in a little while, I'll let you
touch a real woman's boobs and behind!

161
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,800
R-Really?!

162
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,220
Yeah! Sure thing!

163
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:06,810
<i>That's got him! I knew it, he's the</i>
<i>same type as Old Man Turtle Hermit!</i>

164
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,190
Father, when you say that,
what do you intend to do?

165
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,360
What will I do?

166
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,200
Since I can't go down to
the Lower Realm any more...

167
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,570
You've got a girlfriend,
right, that girl Videl?

168
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,200
I hate to ask, but for just a bit,
have her let him touch her.

169
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,210
W-W-What are you saying?! That isn't funny!

170
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,710
Oh yeah? This is a problem...

171
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,550
Still, with Super Saiyan 3
and Fusion and everything,

172
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:46,600
circumstances are getting far beyond
anything on a dimension we can handle, huh?

173
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:58,910
It looks as though we won't
get a turn... this time around.

174
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:04,580
That's not so! I'm sure
there's something we all can do.

175
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,790
And that's the game! Ta-da!

176
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,810
Say, would it be okay if she's
kind of a middle-aged woman?

177
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,230
Well, if she's sexy,
I suppose that would be fine.

178
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,440
All right! Let's make it Bulma!

179
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,230
You explain the situation to
Bulma and ask her to do it for me!

180
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,610
I-I have to ask Bulma-san to do such a thing?!

181
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:40,780
So, this ability, can it beat Majin Boo?

182
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,620
Well, I can't say absolutely,
y'know, but I think it will.

183
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,540
See? Just by allowing him to
touch someone's behind and boobs,

184
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,960
the Earth–no, the whole
universe can be saved!

185
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,920
Isn't that sexual harassment?

186
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,130
And besides, I'm the one
who has to ask her, right?

187
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,010
Even if the universe does get saved,
I'm going to get killed by Bulma-<i>san</i>!

188
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,180
Fine! Okay!

189
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,180
It's settled then.

190
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,850
So, what is this "ability" then?

191
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,030
I, y'know, can take anyone
who's good at what they do,

192
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,990
y'know, and with my mental power, y'know,

193
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:36,540
draw out their hidden power wa-ay,
wa-ay past their limits, here.

194
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,960
Ever heard of such an incredible ability?

195
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,060
Hey, that's an ability you
hear about rather often, ain't it?

196
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,640
What are you talking about?!

197
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,140
Past their limits, you know, past their limits!

198
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,560
There's absolutely no one else like that!

199
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,570
N-Now that you mention it, I guess not.

200
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,950
Hey, you're the one that
pulled that sword out, aren't you?

201
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,540
Go stand over there.

202
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,080
Right.

203
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,130
If anyone was able to pull that sword out
and be able to swing it around, y'know,

204
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:26,090
once I set him up, y'know, he's sure
to be the strongest in the universe.

205
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,100
However, y'know, I had thought that
whoever pulled out that sword, y'know,

206
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:40,150
and let me out, y'know,
would have been a Kaioshin.

207
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,150
Who would have thought that
I would be saved by a human?

208
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,990
What is the world coming to?

209
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,450
M-My sincere apologies...

210
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,500
All right! Stand there, and
you can't move too much!

211
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,500
Right!

212
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:05,630
Okay then, here goes. Go defeat Majin Boo!

213
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,020
Um, is that–?

214
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,180
Quiet!

215
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,110
We're in the middle of an important ceremony!

216
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,150
Ceremony? This?

217
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,560
S-Say, uh, how long does this take?

218
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,270
The ceremony is five hours.

219
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,730
To power him up takes another twenty hours.

220
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:56,870
I'm going to go take a
little nap. Hang in there, Gohan!

221
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:59,250
Th-This can't be...!

222
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:21,100
I-It wouldn't do for us to
not stay awake, would it?

223
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,520
Indeed.

224
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,070
Th-This is lousy.

225
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:35,910
Fusion Ha!

226
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,080
All right! Good, you're just about perfect!

227
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,920
Okay, it's about time when we can
see whether or not you can do this.

228
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,920
All right, you two make
your <i>ki</i> exactly the same!

229
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,380
Right!

230
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,560
<i>A-Am I really going to be</i>
<i>able to merge with this guy?</i>

231
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,980
<i>Unbelievable. It sounds fishy to me.</i>

232
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,150
Okay, begin!

233
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,900
Right!

234
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:10,990
<i>Has Fusion been mastered at last?</i>

235
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,320
<i>And can Gohan really power</i>
<i>up through the mental abilities</i>

236
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,950
<i>of the 15-generation-old Kaioshin?</i>

237
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:24,460
<i>The annihilation of the Earth is</i>
<i>drawing close before our very eyes!</i>

238
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:39,010
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

239
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,600
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

240
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:56,200
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

241
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,290
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

242
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:09,290
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

243
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:14,670
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

244
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,550
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

245
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:27,600
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

246
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,150
<i>Even now?</i>

247
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:36,780
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

248
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:42,160
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

249
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,670
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

250
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:58,720
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

251
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,610
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

252
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,990
<i>All right, you've got</i>
<i>the Fusion down perfectly!</i>

253
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,740
<i>Now for the birth of the</i>
<i>warrior who will defeat Majin Boo!</i>

254
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,580
<i>Now, see here! I don't</i>
<i>care how strong you are!</i>

255
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,040
<i>Don't go off after Boo without</i>
<i>even turning Super Saiyan!</i>

256
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,250
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

257
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:32,960
<i>"Birth of a Superhuman Warrior!!</i>
<i>His Name is Gotenks."</i>

258
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,260
<i>Gotenks? Even his personality is different.</i>

259
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,800
"Next time"
"Birth of a Superhuman Warrior!!
His Name is Gotenks"
