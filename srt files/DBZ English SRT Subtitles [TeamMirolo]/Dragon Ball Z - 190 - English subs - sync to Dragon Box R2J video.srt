00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,770
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,120
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:51,960
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

15
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,790
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,640
Goodbye, Gohan.

17
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,470
Father!!

18
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,240
<i>However, Cell was alive!</i>

19
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,060
I'm not playing around any longer.

20
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,190
I'm going to put an end to this right away.

21
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,120
Let you and the whole Earth cease to exist!

22
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:45,420
<i>"From Goku to Gohan...</i>
<i>The Spirit of the Father is Handed Down."</i>

23
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,390
The Earth will be blown away.
Everything will be blown away.

24
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,140
It will all become the darkness
of space, with no traces remaining!

25
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,400
<i>It's no use! I can't win!</i>

26
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,230
<i>Cell has returned with tremendous power!</i>

27
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,280
<i>Father, I'm sorry. I couldn't</i>
<i>defend the Earth against Cell.</i>

28
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,540
If only I hadn't overdone things,

29
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,740
I would have been able to defend the Earth...!

30
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,100
It's a trick! An incredible trick!

31
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,140
C-Cell is giving off a strange glow!

32
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,440
The area around him is like a typhoon!

33
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,100
It has become a windstorm!

34
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,400
I, your announcer, will carry out my mission,

35
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,030
and continue this broadcast,
even if it is not getting through!

36
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,450
How can this be? To think that
I've become excess baggage...!

37
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,830
Me, a warrior-race Saiyan...!

38
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,380
S-Sorry about that, Gohan!

39
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,630
<i>V-Vegeta-san just apologized...</i>

40
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,520
He's realized that there's
absolutely nothing we can do now...!

41
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,690
Gohan...

42
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,400
Dammit!

43
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,490
I hate the fact that we are powerless!

44
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,560
–Kami-<i>sama</i>, what is it?
–I-Incredible power!

45
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,940
I've never felt power like this.

46
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,610
Cell? What will happen?

47
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,740
Gohan-<i>san...</i>

48
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,510
Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>, what is going on?

49
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,260
On that faraway planet of Earth,
where Dende is, there's an ominous <i>ki...</i>

50
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,480
Earth may be done for.

51
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,860
I am perfect.

52
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,740
I never imagined I could come this far.

53
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,330
Is this the ultimate perfect form
that Doctor Gero was aiming for?

54
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,630
Doctor Gero, how long are you
planning to continue your research?

55
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, is it you guys?

56
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,050
If this is for defeating Son Goku, then...

57
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,880
I think we're all that will be needed.

58
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,010
Don't touch that!

59
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,020
This is research toward
the ultimate Artificial Human.

60
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,860
Ultimate?

61
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,480
Will he be even stronger than us?

62
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,150
Of course!

63
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
He will be on a whole different level.

64
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,700
You will be like children,
and him an adult, comparatively.

65
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,290
Now hurry back to your
storage capsules and go to sleep.

66
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,410
Otherwise, I will push the
button on your controller again!

67
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,650
You fool!

68
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,690
But then in time, you will be swallowed,

69
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:03,160
and then, you will become a part
of the ultimate Artificial Human...!

70
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,370
You're talking nonsense.

71
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,260
He's surprisingly cute, isn't he?

72
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,260
So this is the ultimate Artificial Human.

73
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,720
Something must have been
the matter with Doctor Gero.

74
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
This isn't really fair to you,

75
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,890
but I doubt that this laboratory
will be needed any longer.

76
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,810
"Snip."

77
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,360
I'd like to get some new clothes.

78
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:47,320
It's not very fashionable
wearing the same thing all the time.

79
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,060
However, even after Doctor Gero died,

80
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,480
I continued to be cultured by his computer.

81
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,950
Cell, you are the ultimate Artificial Human,

82
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,070
made from cells gathered from
the most accomplished of warriors.

83
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,950
You will absorb No. 17 and No. 18,
and achieve your perfect form.

84
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,860
Several years later, I came forth on the earth.

85
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,650
At the time, it had already been turned
into a dead planet by No. 17 and No. 18.

86
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,200
Even so, I took in what
little living energy remained,

87
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,200
and continued to grow, in
order to reach my perfect form.

88
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,830
However, for some reason,
no matter where I looked,

89
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,040
I could not find No. 17 or No. 18 anywhere.

90
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,050
No matter what, I desired
to achieve my perfect form.

91
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,010
In pursuit of No. 17 and No. 18,

92
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,220
I returned once again to my larval state,

93
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,890
and using Trunks' time machine,

94
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,890
I came back ten years into this time period.

95
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,770
Come on out, you monstrous freak!

96
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,110
I will neither run nor hide!

97
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,200
As you wish, I've come forward!

98
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,470
Damn it all!

99
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,630
That is how I reached my perfect form.

100
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,970
However, at the time,

101
00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:00,480
I still had not realized the ultimate
strength that Doctor Gero was after.

102
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,380
Doctor Gero's ambition
wasn't about something small,

103
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,470
like defeating Son Goku.

104
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,220
It was to develop ultimate strength,

105
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,100
with which to rule the world–the entire universe.

106
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,480
And during this fight,
I've come to understand that.

107
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,770
That is to say, like Piccolo,
having the ability to regenerate,

108
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,440
so long as there is still a tiny nucleus,

109
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,780
along with the ability of the Saiyans
to power-up even greater than before,

110
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,450
after being saved from the brink of death,

111
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,450
as well as having a merciless,

112
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,080
cold-blooded, unfeeling heart, like Freeza,

113
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,090
put together, they all served
as Doctor Gero calculated.

114
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,090
The only thing he was mistaken
about was the destruction of the Earth.

115
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,010
But several more years into the future,

116
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,930
the Earth would be destroyed anyhow,

117
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,850
and I could use Instantaneous
Movement to go to another planet.

118
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,560
Perfect strength...

119
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,230
It is beyond what I could have imagined.

120
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,500
Damn. Is there really nothing we can do?

121
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,930
Is this how the Earth comes to an end?

122
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,400
I've already stored up enough
energy to blow away not just Earth,

123
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,110
but the entire solar system!

124
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,200
C-Cell's strange glow is getting brighter,

125
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,080
and the ground is trembling violently!

126
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,500
Wha–What exactly is happening?
We do not understand this!

127
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,050
It's a trick! A trick! A trick!

128
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,290
What's goin' on?!

129
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,080
The TV's not showin' anythin',
and the ground is shakin'!

130
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,500
Gohan-<i>chan</i>! Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

131
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,380
–Gohan-<i>chan</i>!
–C-Chichi!

132
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,090
Now's the sort of time when
it's important to calm down!

133
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:17,550
That's easy for you to say, but I can't do that!

134
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,930
Gohan-<i>chan</i>! Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

135
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,510
Chichi! Chichi!

136
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,140
Chichi! Are you here?!

137
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,600
That voice...

138
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,940
Uranai O-Baba!

139
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,110
Ah, you are here!

140
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,950
Chichi, I wanted you to
see what your son was up to.

141
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:42,410
And since the TVs aren't showing anything,

142
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,660
I thought you might be worried.

143
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,870
Hurry! Hurry up and show me!

144
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,820
Hurry!

145
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,230
Now, now, take it easy.

146
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,820
Gohan...?

147
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,370
Gohan! What's wrong with your arm?!

148
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,750
Chichi!

149
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,380
Gohan...

150
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,310
What's wrong, Gohan?

151
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,690
I know, show me your final resistance!

152
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,030
Do it! I know that my resistance is futile.

153
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,370
Father isn't the only one I'm going to
let die–we're all going together!

154
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,450
How dull.

155
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,330
What a disappointing end
this has turned out to be.

156
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,910
Well then, how about I help myself to
bringing about the end of everything?!

157
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,170
<i>It's over... It's all over...</i>
<i>The Earth will be wiped out...!</i>

158
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,720
Don't talk such foolishness!

159
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,100
Gohan, it's not like a Saiyan to give up! Gohan!

160
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,020
Father! W-Where are you?

161
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,360
The Next World.

162
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,110
I'm having Kaio-<i>sama</i> help me talk to you.

163
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,840
You've got the blood of the warrior
Saiyan race flowing through you.

164
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,090
Slam him with a <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>
as hard as you can!

165
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:05,340
If you do, you can beat
him for sure! I guarantee it!

166
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:12,220
B-But right now, I can only use one arm,
and I've got less than half of my <i>ki</i> left...

167
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,060
Who is he talking to?

168
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,360
You're so terrified that
you're talking to yourself, huh?

169
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
That's all right, you can win!

170
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,240
Believe in your own power, Gohan!

171
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,120
Right now, you're the
strongest one in the universe!

172
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,170
U-Understood, Father!

173
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,260
I'll do everything that I can!

174
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,430
Me and Kaio-<i>sama</i> are having a
good time of it here in the Next World,

175
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,260
so you have yourself a
good time there on Earth, too!

176
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,220
You've put me out.

177
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,810
I'm so sorry, Father.

178
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:05,990
Because I got too carried
away, I got you killed...

179
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:10,910
Gohan, it's nothing to be sad about.
Your father may be dead,

180
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:15,240
but whenever you think of me,
we'll always be together.

181
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,660
But...

182
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,250
If that's what you think, then avenge me.

183
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,670
Now, let Cell have it!

184
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:24,340
Right!

185
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,890
Gohan...!

186
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,270
H-He's set his mind to fight back!

187
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,690
<i>Ka...</i>

188
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:42,690
<i>me...</i>

189
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,690
<i>ha...</i>

190
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,230
<i>me...</i>

191
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,900
So you've finally come around, huh?

192
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,210
What is it, Kami-<i>sama</i>?

193
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,500
Gohan-<i>san</i>, hang in there!

194
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,050
Gohan-<i>chan...</i>

195
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,450
I-It's no use! He can't win!

196
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,540
Gohan's <i>ki</i> is too weak, too weak!

197
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,090
Burn in hell!!

198
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,460
<i>Gohan engages in a final, last-ditch struggle!</i>

199
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,580
<i>Was that image of Goku that</i>
<i>appeared behind him an illusion?</i>

200
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,460
<i>Or something else?</i>

201
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,400
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

202
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,240
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

203
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,610
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

204
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,080
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

205
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,630
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

206
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:15,720
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

207
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,220
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

208
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,850
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

209
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:29,350
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

210
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,480
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

211
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,280
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

212
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,320
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

213
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,000
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

214
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,170
<i>So sorry.</i>

215
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:52,290
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

216
00:23:55,050 --> 00:24:00,300
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

217
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,190
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

218
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,700
<i>Gohan, you're still worried</i>
<i>about damaging the Earth,</i>

219
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,070
<i>and ain't putting out all of your power!</i>
<i>Let your power explode!</i>

220
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,290
<i>Gohan, you are me and Goku-sa's son.</i>

221
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,910
<i>You can't let yourself be beaten by Cell!</i>

222
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,960
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

223
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,210
<i>"The Battle is Over...</i>
<i>Thank You, Son Goku."</i>

224
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,000
<i>I did it, Father!</i>

225
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,920
"Next time"
"The Battle is Over...
Thank You, Son Goku"
