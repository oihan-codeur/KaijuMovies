<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

2
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:24,785
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,745
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:08,225
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,735
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:26,685
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:30,255
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:37,125
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:56,185 --> 00:02:04,455
<i>Freeza's secret weapon, the Ginyu</i>
<i>Special Corps, had at last gone into action.</i>

17
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:19,835
Where are you, you punk kids?!

18
00:02:19,875 --> 00:02:22,845
Come on out, or you'll be sorry!

19
00:02:26,615 --> 00:02:29,445
<i>Vegeta was burning with rage after Gohan</i>

20
00:02:29,485 --> 00:02:31,845
<i>and the others took the</i>
<i>Si Xing Qiu Ball from him.</i>

21
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:37,255
<i>However, by then, Bulma and the</i>
<i>others had moved their hiding place.</i>

22
00:02:37,295 --> 00:02:41,585
<i>Further, in order to have</i>
<i>Gohan's dormant power drawn out,</i>

23
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:47,365
<i>he was headed to the Grand</i>
<i>Elder's place, along with Kuririn.</i>

24
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:55,635
<i>"Watch Out, Bulma!!</i>
<i>Si Xing Qiu Falls into Freeza's Clutches."</i>

25
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:43,395
W-What?! What was that?!

26
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:53,825
I've found you!

27
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,825
V-V-V...

28
00:03:55,865 --> 00:04:00,275
How dare you make a mockery of me!

29
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:12,985
Where is the Dragon Ball?!

30
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:18,285
There.

31
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:21,265
Where is it?!

32
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,565
I-I told you... it's right there.

33
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:32,335
If you won't tell me,
then I'll just have to do this!

34
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:37,675
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>I've been telling you, haven't I?</i>

35
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,545
It's there! It's there! Why don't you get it?!

36
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:45,315
It's there, I tell you!

37
00:04:49,855 --> 00:04:51,845
It was a dream, huh?

38
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:20,155
<i>Damn it...</i>

39
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:23,455
<i>If the device that kid was holding</i>

40
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:27,855
<i>really is something that</i>
<i>can seek out Dragon Balls,</i>

41
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:31,855
<i>then I can't be careless about leaving here.</i>

42
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:34,865
<i>They wanted these six, too.</i>

43
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:37,705
<i>All I can do is wait for</i>
<i>them to make their move.</i>

44
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:08,495
<i>Freeza is starting to get pretty impatient, huh?</i>

45
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:13,765
<i>That means I've destroyed the</i>
<i>spaceship's power, and he can't move.</i>

46
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:46,195
<i>Even assuming that he radioed</i>
<i>to have more Scouters brought here,</i>

47
00:06:46,235 --> 00:06:48,865
<i>it would take three or four</i>
<i>days for them to get here, at best.</i>

48
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:51,835
<i>I'll have to settle this before that time.</i>

49
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,845
<i>If I can just acquire eternal</i>
<i>life with the Dragon Balls,</i>

50
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:58,515
<i>then depending on my strategy,</i>
<i>I'm sure I will be able to defeat Freeza.</i>

51
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:02,115
<i>Now, when he doesn't</i>
<i>have a Scouter, is my chance.</i>

52
00:07:19,575 --> 00:07:22,475
That miserable Vegeta!

53
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:50,665
W-What is with all these earthquakes lately?

54
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:06,645
That's it! I've had all I can
take of this crazy planet!

55
00:08:34,215 --> 00:08:39,515
Damn, it's going to take quite a bit
of time for us to get there at this speed.

56
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,815
But if we use any more <i>ki</i> than this,

57
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,515
that Vegeta bastard will
find us, no doubt about it.

58
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:49,795
It looked like he had gotten even stronger.

59
00:08:49,835 --> 00:08:51,155
Right now, even with the two of us

60
00:08:51,195 --> 00:08:53,295
going at him together,
there's no way we could beat him.

61
00:08:53,335 --> 00:09:00,065
But then, do I really have
enough power to rival Vegeta?

62
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,165
I wouldn't think so.

63
00:09:02,205 --> 00:09:07,905
Well, I had <i>this</i> much latent power,
so with you having Saiyan blood,

64
00:09:07,945 --> 00:09:10,515
I think we're okay to expect quite a lot.

65
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:12,455
Probably, anyway.

66
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:42,835
It's not like I have to go in and get it, right?

67
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,175
Even in the water like that,
it's still right nearby,

68
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,845
the same as if it were on shore.

69
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:50,815
Once Kuririn gets back,
I can just have him go get it.

70
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,375
Sure.

71
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,375
D-Don't tell me it's Vegeta!

72
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:27,845
<i>What do I do? If Si Xing Qiu</i>
<i>falls into Vegeta's hands,</i>

73
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:33,525
<i>he'll have all seven Dragon Balls,</i>
<i>and be granted eternal life.</i>

74
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:36,695
<i>If that happens, then no matter</i>
<i>how much training Son-kun has done,</i>

75
00:11:36,735 --> 00:11:38,325
<i>he'll have no chance of winning.</i>

76
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,825
<i>And that's not all.</i>

77
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,495
<i>Yamucha and the others won't</i>
<i>be able to come back to life, either.</i>

78
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:47,205
<i>And I'll never be able to return to Earth.</i>

79
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:49,075
<i>All right...</i>

80
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:53,915
Let's see, as I recall, it was this one.

81
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:05,815
Taking the fight to Vegeta, or
whoever it is, is better than waiting around,

82
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,855
rotting away on this planet.

83
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:24,875
Let's see...

84
00:12:24,915 --> 00:12:28,975
This is for missiles, and
this is for the laser cannon.

85
00:12:53,235 --> 00:12:55,075
Okay...

86
00:13:51,695 --> 00:13:53,365
There it is!

87
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:59,165
I get it. You're the culprit, huh?

88
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,005
Well then, I'm not going to hold back.

89
00:14:10,355 --> 00:14:12,185
I did it!

90
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,685
Yahoo!

91
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:47,885
<i>Ka... me... ha... me...</i>

92
00:14:47,925 --> 00:14:49,385
<i>Ha!!</i>

93
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,315
S-Senzu... senzu...

94
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:37,235
Whew! I have to be more careful.
I got a glimpse of the Next World there.

95
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:40,235
If I'm dead, I won't be
able to train worth crap.

96
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:42,465
I'll be there in just over two days.

97
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:46,005
Well, I guess I should
keep at it a little longer.

98
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:56,345
That's a good boy. Just stay still.

99
00:16:11,005 --> 00:16:13,495
That's a big pearl!

100
00:16:14,545 --> 00:16:17,005
Something like that would be...

101
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:51,205
Be a good boy there for
just a little while, okay?

102
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,155
All right...

103
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:10,495
Huh?

104
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,185
Hang on a minute!

105
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,705
There it is!

106
00:17:58,475 --> 00:18:02,575
H-Hold on, here... What is this?

107
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:08,085
It's almost as though they
were imitation Dragon Balls, huh?

108
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,515
What in the world could this be?

109
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:14,615
In any event, the first order of
business is to get the <i>Si Xing Qiu</i> Ball back.

110
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:53,795
My Capsule! My escape Capsule!
It's gone... it's gone!

111
00:18:53,835 --> 00:18:54,965
You're kidding me!

112
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:58,165
It was there just a moment ago!

113
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,635
Where is it?! Where did it go?!

114
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,645
There it is!

115
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:31,665
It will take more than that to defeat Bulma<i>-san</i>!

116
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:49,685
Geez, like I've been telling you,
that's my <i>Si Xing Qiu</i> there, not yours!

117
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:52,255
They were eggs!

118
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,655
Watch out!

119
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:11,005
What are you doing?! Run!

120
00:21:14,345 --> 00:21:16,135
I'm not doing this for you!

121
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:18,835
I'm doing it for the Dragon Ball!

122
00:21:42,365 --> 00:21:45,705
I've had it with living like this.

123
00:21:48,205 --> 00:21:52,045
Where are the other Dragon Balls?

124
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:55,705
Where is Vegeta?

125
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:03,515
No matter. Once you go before Freeza<i>-sama,</i>
you'll talk, whether you want to or not.

126
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:06,185
Freeza?

127
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,695
Come on!

128
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:16,195
<i>Bulma goes from one crisis to another.</i>

129
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:27,045
<i>And has one of the Dragon Balls</i>
<i>once again passed into Freeza's hands?</i>

130
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:48,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

131
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

132
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

133
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

134
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

135
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,955
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

136
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,455
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

137
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

138
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:29,605
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

139
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

140
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

141
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

142
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

143
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

144
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,525
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

145
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,535
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

146
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:13,615
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

147
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:18,285
<i>Whew! A Kamehame-Ha at</i>
<i>100 Gs also has 100 times more force!</i>

148
00:24:18,325 --> 00:24:19,315
<i>That was a close one!</i>

149
00:24:19,355 --> 00:24:22,155
<i>What are you doing, Son-kun?!</i>
<i>Hurry up and get here!</i>

150
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:23,825
<i>Don't you care that a spunky young girl...</i>

151
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:26,825
