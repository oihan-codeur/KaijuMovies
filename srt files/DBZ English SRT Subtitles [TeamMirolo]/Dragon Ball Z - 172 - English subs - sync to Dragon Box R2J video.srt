3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,760
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,300
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:52,190
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:04,700
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

15
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:57,420
<i>Goku and Gohan were living</i>

17
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,560
<i>Unable to control their ki, they</i>

18
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,780
"Happy Birthday"

19
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:29,660
<i>As the days leisurely went by,</i>
<i>their family ties grew deeper.</i>

20
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,090
<i>However, the fated day of the</i>
<i>Cell Games was drawing ever closer.</i>

21
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,770
<i>"Seek Out Kami-sama!!</i>
<i>Goku's Great Instantaneous Movement."</i>

22
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,340
Sheesh! What are you
dragging this out for, scum?!

23
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,510
Or have you gone and
kicked the bucket in there?!

24
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,680
S-Still time before 24 hours up.

25
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,180
Dammit!

26
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,520
Just you try going even one second over!

27
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,850
I'll drag you out of there, even if
I have to knock down the door to do it!

28
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,730
Ah! He's coming out!

29
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:53,330
Hmph! So you've finally come out, huh?

30
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,970
Now then, it's my turn.

31
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,310
Piccolo-<i>san</i>'s power has risen exceptionally!

32
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,440
What's with you? You haven't changed at all.

33
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,240
What were you, napping or something?

34
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:55,890
<i>Just you watch, Kakarrot!</i>

35
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,390
<i>I will surpass you! Count on it!</i>

36
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,110
Everyone throughout the world,

37
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,120
our Royal Defense Force is determined...

38
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,740
...to use all of its power to put a halt

39
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:19,540
to the monster that calls itself Cell.

40
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,120
Please, do not panic, but rather wait calmly–

41
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,710
There's no way an army can
win against him, don't you know?

42
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,510
All we can do is rely on
Son-<i>kun</i> and the others.

43
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,220
You know, this really is incredible.

44
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,770
I was surprised just by you
having an even greater superpower

45
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,560
than No. 17 and No. 18,

46
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,270
but you even have a device that can detect <i>ki.</i>

47
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,860
What's more, I have absolutely
no idea what it's made of.

48
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,130
Oh, there's one, there's one! See there?

49
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:17,510
There are some huge fish in this lake!

50
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,810
S-Say, Father?

51
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,520
Are you sure it's okay for
us to be taking it so easy?

52
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,690
Indeed! What are you so relaxed for?

53
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,690
Don't worry, I tell you!

54
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,690
Something will turn up, most likely.

55
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,150
M-Most likely?

56
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,990
It's all right, we can win!

57
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,530
I told you, didn't I,

58
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:42,120
that there ain't any meaning for us to
train any harder than we already have?

59
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,120
We've gone right up to our limits.

60
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,130
R-Right...

61
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,340
Well, Goku, if you're the one who says so,

62
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,130
I guess we'll just have to believe it.

63
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,840
You guys! Our lunches are ready!

64
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,010
Oh? Thank you!

65
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,720
Now then, don't worry about it,

66
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,850
just take it easy, and let's enjoy ourselves!

67
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,440
It sure looks good!

68
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,900
Still and all, I wouldn't have expected this.

69
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,700
Goku, when did you get your driver's license?

70
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,160
You know what?

71
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,750
It was three years ago, together with Piccolo.

72
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,870
W-With Piccolo...?

73
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,420
Yup! But you know what?

74
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:36,630
The two of them were really wild,
and they upset their instructors.

75
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,100
At first, they didn't pass.

76
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,430
I-I think I get the idea.

77
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,720
But you know what?

78
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,560
I pleaded as hard as
I could to the instructors, right?

79
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,560
And he finally got it!

80
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,100
So, what about the written exam?

81
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,730
I stayed up all night
drillin' Goku-<i>sa</i> on it.

82
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,570
I should have known!

83
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,610
And as a result,

84
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:41,860
it's so nice that we can have
Goku-<i>sa</i> take us out for a drive like this!

85
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm so happy about it!

86
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,200
It's almost like I'm havin' a dream!

87
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,000
Goku-<i>sa</i>, you really
are one sharp husband!

88
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,520
I know!

89
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,520
Let's stop off at Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>'s
place on our way home!

90
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,860
Yeah.

91
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,510
Hey! What's taking so long?! I'll flatten you!

92
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,130
Shut your trap,

93
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,220
or you're gonna get eaten by Cell!

94
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,480
That's one incredible traffic jam.

95
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,860
Everyone's runnin' away from the cities.

96
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,410
You can't blame them.

97
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,370
You'd have to think that the
rural areas would be safer, after all.

98
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,740
That could be it, I guess.

99
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,350
None of the stores are open, huh?

100
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,890
Everyone is closed.

101
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:35,230
That's what happens when you
might die in another seven days.

102
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,900
Nobody's gonna work.

103
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,070
Aw, this makes shoppin'
for anything impossible!

104
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,910
And here I wanted to buy a present
to take to Old Man Turtle Hermit.

105
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,750
We interrupt this program
for a special news bulletin.

106
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,710
Oh, there's someone who's working!

107
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,800
In order to defeat the
monster who calls himself Cell,

108
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,050
the Royal Defense Force
is heading to 28-KS Mark 5.

109
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:09,550
It appears that the
attack is just about to begin.

110
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,640
What?!

111
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,960
Ladies and gentleman, please observe.

112
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,510
This is the vast army of
the Royal Defense Force,

113
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,710
with all of its power concentrated together!

114
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,800
No matter how great a monster he may be,

115
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,430
I doubt there is anything
he can do against this force!

116
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,520
D-Did he say army?

117
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,360
Idiots! What are they thinking?

118
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,070
Don't they know they're
just going to get killed in vain?!

119
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,040
My, my... has the army of fools arrived?

120
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,370
Prepare to attack!

121
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,890
H-He's running away!

122
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:21,350
Idiot. I just don't want the ring

123
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,560
I went to such trouble to make to get destroyed.

124
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,860
Don't let him get away!
Fire! Begin an all-out attack!

125
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:15,570
An incredible barrage has begun!
Listen to the sound of that!

126
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,580
I-It's a tremendous assault!
It's still... still going on!

127
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,960
After taking this kind of attack directly,

128
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,130
there can scarcely be
any hide or hair of him left!

129
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,790
G-Get out of there...! Hurry!

130
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,850
All right! Cease fire!

131
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,490
Stop! That's enough!

132
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,030
Stop shooting!

133
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,550
How's that? Serves you right!

134
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,580
I-It can't be...!

135
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,340
I-Impossible...

136
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,590
He's still alive! He's a monster!

137
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:10,400
The foolish must be given their punishment.

138
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,750
U-Unbelievable! He's still alive!

139
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:31,130
C-Cell appears to be completely unaffected!

140
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,170
S-Stop! Cell, don't kill them!

141
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,800
Stop!!

142
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,660
D-Damn it all...!

143
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,620
That did at least kill some time.

144
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,470
Sorry about this, but you
all go on ahead without me.

145
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,140
I have to go see Piccolo about something.

146
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:37,150
S-Say, what could he have to see Piccolo about?

147
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,320
Beats me...

148
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,700
Goku!

149
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,830
Huh? Piccolo,

150
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:52,500
by any chance, did you go into
the Room of Spirit and Time too?

151
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,500
That's right.

152
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,500
I knew it! I can tell, the way
your very level has increased.

153
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,840
How about being candid with me?

154
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,130
I may have become stronger,

155
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,140
but it still won't be of
any use against Cell, right?

156
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,680
Nope. It's no use, all right.

157
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,140
You really do put it candidly.

158
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,150
So, what have you come here for?

159
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,360
Tell me, can you split into two again,

160
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,690
like how you were before
you merged with Kami-<i>sama</i>?

161
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,150
What?

162
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,700
See, when Kami-<i>sama</i>
and Piccolo merged together,

163
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:27,370
the Dragon Balls disappeared, right?

164
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,870
There are a lot of people who Cell has killed

165
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,170
that somehow need to be brought back to life,

166
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,790
and I think that we're going
to need them after this, as well.

167
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,550
I get you. But unfortunately, it's not possible.

168
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,930
Once we've united together,
we can never become a pair again.

169
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,310
Otherwise, Kami wouldn't have
hesitated so much over uniting.

170
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,560
Is that right?

171
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,940
So that won't work, huh? Sure enough...

172
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,780
Say, I heard from Gohan
that the surviving people

173
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,570
from Namek went off to
some other planet, right?

174
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,740
Maybe I can go seek them out.

175
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,580
What?

176
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,750
If possible,

177
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,750
supposing one of them doesn't mind
staying here on Earth for a long time,

178
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,380
then both Kami-<i>sama</i> and the
Dragon Balls can be restored! Right?

179
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,100
I'm going to head out for a bit,
in search of Namekians!

180
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,100
If you find new Kami-<i>sama</i>, Popo happy too!

181
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,980
But Goku, how are you
going to get them to come?

182
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,730
We don't even know
what planet they went to.

183
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,110
It's going to take too much time.

184
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,940
What are you talking about?

185
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,110
I've got my Instantaneous
Movement ability, ain't I?

186
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:49,910
All I have to do is search out a <i>ki</i>
that's very similar to yours, Piccolo,

187
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,780
and that will be the planet
where the Namekians are...

188
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,080
Can you sense <i>ki</i>
that are that far away?

189
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,580
Probably.

190
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,130
As long as it's not too far
away, I think I'll be all right.

191
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,800
Let's give it a try, right now.
Be quiet for me for a bit...

192
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,710
Sorry, no good! Now what do we do?

193
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,840
I-I know!

194
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,350
I might be able to search for
them from where Kaio-<i>sama</i> is!

195
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,350
Let's see, Kaio-<i>sama</i>, Kaio-<i>sama...</i>

196
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,930
I've found you!

197
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,860
Do you think this is going to work?

198
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,030
I don't know whether we
can count on him or not.

199
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,290
Let's see, where are you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>...?

200
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,430
There you are, there you are!

201
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,100
Yo, Bubbles! It's been too long. How are you?

202
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,110
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, could you wake up for a second?

203
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,450
It's me, Son Goku.

204
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,820
...how pesky... Goku?

205
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,750
Oh, Goku!

206
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,370
So, that's Super Saiyan, is it?

207
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:06,130
What are you doing here, out of the blue?

208
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,590
Are you here to pass some time?

209
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,130
Geez, what is it with you?
You sure are laid back.

210
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,340
Don't you know that there's
something terrible happening on Earth?

211
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,730
<i>There is no longer anything</i>
<i>mankind can do against the devilish Cell.</i>

212
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:28,520
<i>However, how is it that Goku can be so calm?</i>

213
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,250
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

214
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:55,090
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

215
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,470
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

216
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,940
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

217
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:12,440
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

218
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,570
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

219
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,080
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

220
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,700
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

221
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:30,210
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

222
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,300
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

223
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,130
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

224
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:40,140
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

225
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,810
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

226
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,980
<i>So sorry.</i>

227
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,110
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

228
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,120
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

229
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,590
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

230
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,720
<i>Dende, if you become Earth's new Kami-sama,</i>

231
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,090
<i>I'm sure Gohan will be thrilled.</i>

232
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,220
<i>Yeah. He may not look like it,</i>
<i>but he is an outstanding fellow.</i>

233
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,390
<i>Now, let's see the new Kami-sama in action.</i>

234
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,440
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

235
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,560
<i>"Dende's First Task!!</i>
<i>The Dragon Balls Restored."</i>

236
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,610
<i>Hooray! Now I'll be able to see Dende again,</i>

237
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,030
<i>and the Dragon Balls will return to normal!</i>

238
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:38,780
"Next time"
"Dende's First Task!!
The Dragon Balls Restored"
