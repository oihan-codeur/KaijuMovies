00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:46,205
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>! Don't die...

17
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:49,145
I am neither Kami nor Piccolo any longer.

18
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:53,275
I'm a Namekian who has long
since forgotten his real name.

19
00:03:19,415 --> 00:03:23,445
<i>The mysterious monster finally reveals himself.</i>

20
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:28,655
<i>And yet, he bears even</i>

00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:41,405
<i>"Kamehame-Ha!?</i>
<i>The Monster Who Possesses Goku's Ki."</i>

22
00:04:07,425 --> 00:04:10,425
So, you've shown yourself, you beast.

23
00:04:30,585 --> 00:04:33,575
Save me!

24
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,585
W-What's this?

25
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,255
What sort of <i>ki</i> am I sensing from him?

26
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,055
I-Impossible!

27
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:47,765
H-How can it be?!

28
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,815
Mister Popo scared.

29
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:12,955
Kami<i>-sama</i> and Piccolo united, got strong.

30
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:17,295
But still feel he not able defeat monster.

31
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:24,435
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

32
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:29,635
Help me!

33
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:34,805
I am the wealthiest man around here!

34
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:38,845
I'll give you whatever money you want, save me!

35
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:47,125
Hey! How about it, you?!

36
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:51,625
I don't expect you can understand
what I'm saying, but release him.

37
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:54,465
Even a life such as his is still a life.

38
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:04,835
S-Save me...

39
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:40,275
My... mon... ey...

40
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:14,045
The next one to end up like this will be you,

41
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:16,445
Piccolo Daimao!

42
00:07:37,635 --> 00:07:41,235
W-What?! What's this?!

43
00:08:01,365 --> 00:08:03,325
What's the matter, Gohan?

44
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,495
I can feel Piccolo<i>-san</i>'s <i>ki</i>, but twice over!

45
00:08:06,535 --> 00:08:09,195
Eh? Piccolo's?

46
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:14,845
What's this?

47
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:30,015
W-Who are you?!

48
00:08:30,055 --> 00:08:33,285
Why do you know the name Piccolo?

49
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:36,925
I am your brother.

50
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:38,325
What?!

51
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:53,205
Hey, what's going on?! This <i>ki...</i>

52
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:56,005
It's Freeza's, and his father's <i>ki</i> as well!

53
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:58,415
I can feel others.

54
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:10,895
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, Freeza and his father, and now Dad!

55
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:15,265
So many <i>ki</i>, all gathered in one spot.

56
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,485
What's going on here?

57
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,185
This is impossible!

58
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:39,315
We're feeling them, all right.

59
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:41,825
But this cannot be happening.

60
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:45,655
Freeza and his father are supposed to be dead.

61
00:09:45,695 --> 00:09:47,525
This direction...

62
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,435
It's coming from the direction of Gingertown,

63
00:09:50,475 --> 00:09:52,435
where those incidents were reported!

64
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,045
That's impossible!

65
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:03,445
Now there's even Goku's <i>ki...</i>

66
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:12,455
Father is definitely sleeping up here.

67
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:19,425
Sector 1051 West.

68
00:10:19,465 --> 00:10:22,225
Right near where that egg
and carapace were located.

69
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:25,065
There's no doubt about it now.

70
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:41,415
Now then, what exactly are you?

71
00:10:41,455 --> 00:10:44,855
Tell me! Let's have it all.

72
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:49,585
That won't be necessary.

73
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:54,165
See, you are about to become my meal.

74
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:57,465
So, you don't intend to tell me, then.

75
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:07,405
In that event, I'll just have
to squeeze the life out of you

76
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:10,245
not knowing any more than I already do.

77
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:14,815
Does Piccolo Daimao plan on killing me, then?

78
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:19,295
For whatever reason, you
apparently know who Piccolo is.

79
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:22,455
However...

80
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:09,865
However, unfortunately for you...

81
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:15,045
You're mistaking me for him.

82
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:16,875
What?!

83
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:49,105
I'm mistaking you for him, you say?

84
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:55,245
Are you saying you are not Piccolo Daimao?

85
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:57,555
That's what I am saying.

86
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:16,065
Thank goodness, I made it.

87
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:18,275
You may be everything you are,

88
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:21,475
but this unknown monster may
be too dangerous for even you.

89
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:24,115
There's another incredibly powerful <i>ki.</i>

90
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:27,125
Someone else has appeared.

91
00:13:28,525 --> 00:13:31,085
Yeah, just now.

92
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,115
Just what exactly is going on?

93
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:42,165
That has to be Piccolo!

94
00:13:43,535 --> 00:13:48,465
But isn't this <i>ki</i> too far
different from Piccolo<i>-san</i>'s <i>ki</i>?

95
00:13:48,505 --> 00:13:52,075
Awesome, man! He really has united!

96
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:56,245
United? With Kami<i>-sama</i>, like you were saying?

97
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:58,815
They're back together now,
after having been apart?

98
00:13:58,855 --> 00:14:00,115
Right.

99
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:04,085
And since Piccolo was so incredibly
strong to begin with and all...

100
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:07,955
This is the <i>ki</i> of a Super Namekian!

101
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,925
T-This is amazing.

102
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:17,025
He was able to power up that much?

103
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:30,875
Your having extinguished all the people
of this city actually works in my favor.

104
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:32,905
What's that?

105
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,885
What do you mean by that?

106
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:45,725
It means I can go all-out.

107
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:49,535
What?!

108
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:33,105
That shockwave just now...

109
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:40,545
Over there. It's started.

110
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:14,715
There was a definite atmospheric
vibration a moment ago.

111
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:15,915
Could you tell?

112
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,915
Yeah.

113
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:22,085
I wonder if a volcano just
exploded somewhere. Or perhaps...

114
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:24,495
At any rate, it's far from here.

115
00:16:24,535 --> 00:16:27,925
The suburbs of Metro West.

116
00:16:27,965 --> 00:16:29,095
No. 16!

117
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:33,165
There are two giant powers
there, likely battling each other.

118
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:38,475
You've got power radar installed?

119
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,475
How come you haven't said
anything about it until now?

120
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,905
You didn't ask.

121
00:16:42,945 --> 00:16:44,275
I suppose not.

122
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:49,915
So then, can we have you
tell us who is fighting whom?

123
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,485
I don't know.

124
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:54,485
I have no data on either one.

125
00:16:54,525 --> 00:16:59,495
However, one of the powers is
large enough it even rivals your levels.

126
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,125
What?!

127
00:17:03,535 --> 00:17:06,095
Chalk up yet another "miss" to Doctor Gero.

128
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:09,505
That radar of yours is malfunctioning.

129
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:14,505
There's no one in this world
who has the power to rival mine.

130
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:16,345
Utterly ludicrous.

131
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:20,515
Let's go, No. 16.

132
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:05,695
T-That was...

133
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:46,925
So that's what you've got, is it?

134
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:49,825
I had you sized up as
quite an abominable monster,

135
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:52,595
and it looks like I was right.

136
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:55,105
You do pretty well yourself.

137
00:19:55,145 --> 00:20:00,945
No matter that I have not
achieved my perfect form yet...

138
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:02,975
P-Perfect form?

139
00:20:04,655 --> 00:20:06,875
You don't mean...

140
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:11,055
So that's why you've been
preying on these people?!

141
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:16,525
I take them as the energy of life for myself.

142
00:20:18,735 --> 00:20:20,155
Answer this!

143
00:20:20,195 --> 00:20:24,105
Who was it that sent you to
this era in that time machine?!

144
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:28,095
Some ally of yours?

145
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:33,505
I was the one who sent me.

146
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:38,075
That time machine was too
small for this body, you see.

147
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:42,915
I had to revert myself back
to my egg form in order to fit.

148
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:46,085
In any case, it surprises
me that you would even know

149
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,485
about me and the time machine.

150
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:51,525
But...

151
00:20:54,535 --> 00:20:58,095
I doubt you already knew about this...

152
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:17,085
No way, this can't be right!

153
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,925
It's Goku<i>-san</i>'s <i>ki</i> again!

154
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:25,095
<i>Ka...</i>

155
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:27,095
<i>me...</i>

156
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,095
<i>ha...</i>

157
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:31,575
<i>me...</i>

158
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:34,105
Impossible!

159
00:21:57,535 --> 00:21:59,965
F-Father...

160
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,075
<i>W-What is this?</i>

161
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:21,525
<i>Can this monster even</i>
