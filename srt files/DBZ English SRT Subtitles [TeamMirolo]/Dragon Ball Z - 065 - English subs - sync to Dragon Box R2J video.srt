Hey, Butta, Jheese!

Let me take out these two little squirts, too!

<i>But then, Kuririn fell, too.</i>

Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

00:02:30,355 --> 00:02:34,315
F-Frankly, we're finished...

24
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:38,655
We're powerless against them,
and if we run, they'll catch us...

25
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:41,425
And the Dragon Balls have been taken from us...

26
00:02:41,465 --> 00:02:44,325
There's nothing good about this...

27
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:50,275
I-I'll do as much as I can!

<i>"Don't Die, Gohan! Goku Finally</i>

Yeah, that's right, short
stuff, do as much as you can.

30
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:18,265
I, ReaCoom<i>-san</i>, will let
you match up against me, okay?

31
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:23,065
Darn it!

32
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:40,785
Ultimately, we're not going to get a turn, huh?

33
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,785
That's okay.

34
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:48,385
Taking out those two runts wouldn't
give us anything to boast about anyhow.

35
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:51,965
G-Gohan...

36
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,285
That's pretty good.

37
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:15,945
How about this, though?

38
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,325
All righty...

Yeah, for just a second,
his battle power was over 20,000.

42
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:00,395
Gohan...

43
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:25,955
Wow, you're good, you're good.
You made my handsies smart.

44
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:27,855
Now then...

45
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,065
Take this!

46
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:50,085
G-Gohan!

47
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:57,715
Oh, my. Is something the
matter, Goku<i>-chan</i>'s wife?

48
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:01,885
Gohan<i>-chan</i> is in a terrible fix.

49
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:06,825
Gohan<i>-chan...</i>

50
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,725
My Gohan<i>-chan...</i>

51
00:06:08,765 --> 00:06:14,905
Cheer up, Missus. Gohan<i>-chan</i>
will be fine. My Bulma said so.

52
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,075
Is it ready?!

53
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:22,275
Oh, is that you, Chichi<i>-san</i>? Have a look
at how wonderfully this is turning out.

54
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:25,375
You wouldn't think that I put it
together in just two days, would you?

55
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,955
I'll tell you, this second one
was a lot easier than the last one.

56
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:33,295
I even nailed down the
right location for the speakers.

57
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:38,065
All I need to do now is a test flight.

58
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:43,865
Just you wait, Gohan!
Ma is comin' to save you right now!

59
00:06:43,905 --> 00:06:47,965
Hey, Chichi<i>-san</i>, won't you let me
explain how to use it before you go?!

60
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:53,345
Just which one of these is the startin' switch?!

61
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:00,245
Hey, just a minute, I say!

62
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:05,495
G-Gohan!

63
00:07:23,215 --> 00:07:26,145
There, didn't I tell you so?

64
00:07:26,815 --> 00:07:28,945
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

65
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,655
Still alive?

66
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,975
Good, good!

67
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:20,395
Magnificent, Ginyu<i>-san.</i>

68
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:25,635
I would not have expected you to
bring me all seven Dragon Balls so quickly.

69
00:08:25,675 --> 00:08:30,835
It was worth it to call in the
Ginyu Special Corps, all right.

70
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:35,805
It gives me, Ginyu, no greater joy
than to have you say so, Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

71
00:08:35,845 --> 00:08:40,885
This means that I am
about to acquire eternal life.

72
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:43,045
What wonderful joy.

73
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:47,255
If you would like, shall
I dance the dance of joy?

74
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:57,235
P-Perhaps you could do that next time.

75
00:08:57,275 --> 00:08:59,065
Really?

76
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:05,235
Who would have thought the immortal
youth I dreamed about would come true?

77
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:08,845
Even I, of all people,
am starting to get excited.

78
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:10,945
The birth of the perfect and everlasting

79
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:14,845
ruler of the universe is
about to happen, isn't that right?

80
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:21,225
Now, Dragon Balls, give me,
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, eternal life and youth!

81
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:39,305
<i>W-What was that?</i>

82
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,645
<i>I've got an odd feeling of uneasiness.</i>

83
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,425
<i>No doubt about it,</i>

84
00:09:56,465 --> 00:10:00,865
<i>the hands of evil will be extended toward</i>
<i>Grand Elder-sama in the very near future!</i>

85
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:10,045
<i>Forgive me, Earthlings. I have</i>
<i>a duty to protect Grand Elder-sama!</i>

86
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:39,325
Darn it...

87
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,715
Father!

88
00:11:26,585 --> 00:11:29,385
You got up, did you?

89
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:31,915
You got up, you got up!

90
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:45,465
I won't be beaten. Not by you.

91
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:48,875
I won't... be beaten...

92
00:12:22,705 --> 00:12:27,045
What have we here? Did you
mean for that to be an attack?

93
00:12:55,645 --> 00:13:01,705
N-Nothing is happening, huh?
Have you become immortally young yet?

94
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:05,245
N-No, I do not believe so.

95
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,985
W-Why?

96
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:17,295
G-Go on, take it.

97
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:19,825
Even if you do get the Dragon Balls together,

98
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:24,265
you guys won't be able to
get your wish granted anyhow.

99
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:30,215
As I recall, when I took the second
Dragon Ball, that is what the Namekian said.

100
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:35,015
I thought he was just being a poor loser.

101
00:13:36,985 --> 00:13:42,515
"You guys."That is exactly
what he said. "You guys."

102
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:47,355
There has to be some sort of passcode for these!

103
00:13:47,395 --> 00:13:52,695
A secret passcode to grant wishes,
that only the Namekians know!

104
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:56,995
A password! A place! Or perhaps
a way of arranging the Balls!

105
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,835
We will have to ask a Namekian for it.

106
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:04,365
A Namekian? Are there any of
them still surviving anywhere?

107
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:16,985
T-This reading is from Vegeta and company.

108
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,785
It's possible that Vegeta
or the others know what it is.

109
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:25,325
I-In that case, I must stop
my men from killing Vegeta!

110
00:14:27,065 --> 00:14:31,965
Have a look at Point 8829401.

111
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:36,345
There are two readings which
I believe could be Namekians.

112
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:41,945
There is also a reading
that is approaching that point.

113
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:51,085
We have not once attacked this
area, so they must be survivors, yes?

114
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:56,255
Well then, I will go there at once and force
them to tell me how to get a wish granted.

115
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,635
That will not be necessary.
I will go ask them directly.

116
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:08,535
After all, I am more accustomed
to dealing with these people.

117
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:12,905
Ginyu<i>-san</i>, please stay here and
keep watch over the Dragon Balls.

118
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,885
Yes, sir, understood.
Please leave everything to me.

119
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:25,325
Now, to go flying...

120
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:37,305
I won't be beaten...

121
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:44,245
G-Gohan...

122
00:15:45,315 --> 00:15:52,775
I have to... defeat you guys...
for Piccolo<i>-san...</i> Yamucha<i>-san...</i>

123
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:57,785
Tenshinhan<i>-san...</i> Chaozu<i>-san...</i>

124
00:15:57,825 --> 00:16:01,125
Or I can't bring anyone back to life!

125
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:12,765
All right, here I come!

126
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,705
<i>ReaCoom Bomber!!</i>

127
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:41,865
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Go!

128
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,715
Whoops, I'm over here!

129
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:19,605
Have you finally reached your limit?

130
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:49,805
D-Don't get up anymore, Gohan...

131
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:02,035
Darn it...

132
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:25,395
I-I am... Father's...

133
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:32,605
...S-Son Goku's... son...

134
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:38,375
You won't... you won't...

135
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:43,215
Oho, you still have enough energy left
to be spouting that sort of nonsense, huh?

136
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,745
I don't know what planet you're from,
kid, but this is surprising.

137
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,825
Your opponent is too much for you, huh?

138
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:57,495
I won't be beaten!!

139
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:02,635
Whoa!

140
00:20:03,265 --> 00:20:07,705
He's just about ready to croak.
He doesn't have any battle power left.

141
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:11,545
Of course not. His neck has been broken.

142
00:20:13,015 --> 00:20:14,605
Gohan!

143
00:20:17,785 --> 00:20:24,185
P-Pathetic little brat... And here
I thought he'd gotten a little better...

144
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:30,785
Gohan<i>-chan...</i>

145
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:34,025
Yo, are you awake?

146
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,865
Are you all right, Missus?

147
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:45,875
Gohan<i>-chan</i> is... Gohan<i>-chan</i> is–!

148
00:20:45,915 --> 00:20:50,645
Oh, my...

149
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:55,415
Sheesh...

150
00:20:56,485 --> 00:21:00,215
These guys were all just worthless scum.

151
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:06,165
I don't understand why Freeza<i>-sama</i> expressly
called in the Ginyu Special Corps for this.

152
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:12,465
Well, nonetheless, I guess
I should finish off all three of them.

153
00:21:17,915 --> 00:21:19,275
What's that?

154
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:27,685
It's a ship. It's landing.

155
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:48,475
<i>At last, Goku had touched down.</i>

156
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:26,845
<i>Goku, rescue the desperate Gohan and</i>
<i>friends from the devilish hands of ReaCoom!</i>

157
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:49,695
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

158
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:55,535
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

159
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,905
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

160
00:23:01,385 --> 00:23:06,405
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

161
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:12,915
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

162
00:23:12,955 --> 00:23:17,025
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

163
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:20,525
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

164
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,165
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

165
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:30,675
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

166
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:34,775
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

167
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,575
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

168
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:40,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

169
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:46,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

170
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

171
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:53,595
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

172
00:23:56,335 --> 00:24:01,605
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

173
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:14,815
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

174
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:17,915
<i>I've finally arrived. Sorry to</i>
<i>keep you waiting, everyone.</i>

175
00:24:17,955 --> 00:24:19,915
<i>Hey, now, what is this?!</i>

176
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:22,785
<i>I was about to look good</i>
<i>while killing those three!</i>

177
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,955
<i>If that's how you want it, I'll kill you first!</i>

178
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:28,125
<i>Give it up! You can't beat me!</i>

179
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:29,865
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

180
00:24:29,905 --> 00:24:34,935
<i>"Uncommon Strength!!</i>
<i>Son Goku, the Legendary Super Saiyan."</i>

181
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:37,405
<i>Father's strength is astonishing!</i>

182
00:24:37,445 --> 00:24:39,245
"Next time"
"Uncommon Strength!!
Son Goku, the Legendary Super Saiyan"
