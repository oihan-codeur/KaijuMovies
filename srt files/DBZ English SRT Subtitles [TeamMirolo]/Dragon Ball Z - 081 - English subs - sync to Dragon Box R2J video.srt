<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,780
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,770
<i>In the face of Freeza's overwhelming power,</i>

17
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:05,650
<i>Gohan, Kuririn, Vegeta and Dende's</i>
<i>fates were like candles in the wind.</i>

18
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,820
<i>However, just then...</i>

19
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,130
<i>...Piccolo finally arrived</i>!

20
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,130
<i>Having merged with Nail to</i>
<i>become several times more powerful,</i>

21
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,010
<i>Piccolo was quite sure of himself.</i>

22
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:41,810
<i>"Piccolo's Self-Confidence!</i>
<i>I Will Be the One to Defeat Freeza."</i>

23
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,820
I'll do this by myself. You guys stay out of it.

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,130
It's senseless! Not even Piccolo has
a chance of winning against that guy!

25
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,000
<i>Piccolo-san...</i>

26
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,430
Piccolo's <i>ki</i> has increased
considerably since he left his training here.

27
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,830
What's going on?

28
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,430
In that case, Kaio<i>-sama,</i>

29
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,170
are you saying Piccolo has the
potential to win against Freeza?

30
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,170
No...

31
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,770
They have touched that which
should have remained untouched.

32
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,510
Freeza's power is unmatched.

33
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,110
If Piccolo is beaten,
Kami<i>-sama</i> will also die.

34
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,490
If that happens, our chance at
resurrection will probably be forever lost.

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,420
Piccolo, you have to stick it
out until Goku has recovered!

36
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:01,130
That is the issue, isn't it?

37
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,790
Leave this to me, he says.

38
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,490
He doesn't understand how terrifying Freeza is!

39
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,330
He'll realize it soon enough.

40
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,800
Piccolo<i>-san</i> isn't the kind of person
who doesn't know his opponent's strength.

41
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,770
But Gohan, Piccolo hasn't–

42
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,110
I'm sure of it! Piccolo<i>-san</i>
has a chance of winning!

43
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,440
A chance of winning?

44
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
There's no way he can win!

45
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,110
Even though he may have shown up,
our situation hasn't changed a bit.

46
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,490
But Piccolo<i>-san</i> is...

47
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,800
<i>This ki is Piccolo's.</i>
<i>Piccolo has been resurrected!</i>

48
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,670
<i>But this time his ki is different,</i>
<i>more incredible than ever!</i>

49
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,440
H-He looks just like Nail<i>-san,</i>

50
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,980
but is this Piccolo fellow
also a Warrior-type Namekian?

51
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,820
You appear to be quite sure
of yourself. But soon enough,

52
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,490
that surety will shatter, give way and
turn to your begging for your life from me.

53
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,840
Enough from you.

54
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,310
Take this!

55
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,430
He did it!

56
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,770
Way to go, Piccolo!

57
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,770
<i>Struggle though he might,</i>
<i>there's no way he can win.</i>

58
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,810
<i>I hate to admit it, but all I can do</i>
<i>is escape and wait for another chance.</i>

59
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,150
<i>I'm not stupid enough to just</i>
<i>wait around to be killed by Freeza.</i>

60
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,110
Well, come on out!

61
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:18,490
You've got greater power than that, haven't you?

62
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,670
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

63
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,970
You're not that bad.

64
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,840
I mean, you were able to dodge that
from close range by a hair's breadth.

65
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,950
Vegeta!

66
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,610
Where are you going?

67
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:22,640
Don't tell me you need to go pee, now.

68
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,660
Dammit!

69
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,800
Vegeta...

70
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,930
It won't do to have the prince
of the warrior race Saiyans...

71
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,630
...sneaking away with his
tail tucked between his legs.

72
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:44,340
However...

73
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:50,350
No matter what you may try,
your destiny is to be killed by me.

74
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,110
You just sit still and wait for it.

75
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,820
Once I kill the Namekian, your turn comes next.

76
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,610
Sorry for the delay.

77
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,980
Now, show me the power
of that confidence you hold.

78
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,850
You are a fool not to feel my terror!

79
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,640
Gohan! Piccolo has greater
power than we can imagine!

80
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,940
We may be able to hope for something here.

81
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,010
Right! Piccolo<i>-san</i> will do it!

82
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,450
He's your <i>sensei</i>, after all, right?

83
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,820
Right!

84
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,230
N-Nail<i>-san</i>!

85
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,560
Could it be?

86
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,660
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

87
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,830
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

88
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,670
Do not be upset.

89
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,500
It will take more than that to kill him.

90
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,170
But I will show you how I'll take him apart!

91
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,790
You fought well, for a Namekian.
I'll give you credit for that.

92
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:57,290
But it's over. The fun stops now.

93
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,490
<i>Damn.</i>

94
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,830
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

95
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,850
We are now completely out of Namekians.

96
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,500
What?!

97
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,170
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

98
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:47,510
Don't take me so lightly.

99
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,510
G-Gohan! We might be able to win!

100
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,840
You could be right.

101
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,820
With Piccolo and the three of us,
this could turn out all right after all!

102
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,320
Okay then, it's decided!

103
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,990
Stay out of this!

104
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,800
I thought I told you I'd do this by myself.

105
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,800
But...

106
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,470
We can contribute at least something.

107
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,140
Leave this to me.

108
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,140
That fool! This is our
one chance to defeat Freeza!

109
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,810
He's no match for Freeza's
power just by himself!

110
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,160
You filthy maggot!

111
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,960
Haven't you realized it yet?

112
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,170
We can see through your every move!

113
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,510
What?! What do you mean "we?"

114
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,490
What does this mean?

115
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,150
Piccolo!

116
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,660
Piccolo...

117
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,830
<i>Piccolo's ki has surged yet again.</i>

118
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,840
<i>What's happening?!</i>

119
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:26,970
You've become a giant, and you're using
both hands, yet this is the best you've got?

120
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,670
That voice...

121
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,850
I know! What if I were to fight
using only my left hand for you?

122
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,530
Something like that cannot
possibly work against me, can it?

123
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,810
Surely you see there is no way you can win.

124
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:46,180
I have merged with Piccolo.

125
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,190
What?!

126
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,160
I-I knew it!

127
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:55,170
By doing so, my power has
increased several times over.

128
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,140
Unite with me.

129
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:09,140
I am the... last Warrior-Type
Namekian left on my world.

130
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,810
What? Unite with you?

131
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,620
That's right.

132
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,820
If you do, your current power
will be increased several times over.

133
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,620
What incredible power!

134
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,460
What an unbelievably fearsome power this is!

135
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,490
Is this what uniting with someone is like?!

136
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,150
Awesome!

137
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,160
Impossible! I don't believe it!

138
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,830
I have obtained the ultimate power!

139
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,450
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

140
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,620
Piccolo!

141
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,150
Impossible!

142
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,140
What?!

143
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,000
He did it!

144
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,850
Why, you!

145
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:24,800
<i>Nail has merged with Piccolo,</i>
<i>but can Piccolo defeat Freeza?</i>

146
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,830
<i>And what about Goku?</i>

147
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,790
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

148
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,630
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

149
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

150
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,500
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

151
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:12,010
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

152
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:16,110
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

153
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,620
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

154
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,290
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

155
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,760
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

156
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,860
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

157
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,700
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>
