<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,410
<i>At length, Freeza completes</i>
<i>his colossal transformation.</i>

17
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,110
I've decided!

18
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,040
S-So fast!

19
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,010
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

20
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,350
<i>Before such incredible power and speed,</i>
<i>Kuririn was powerless to do anything,</i>

21
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,730
<i>and found himself suddenly</i>
<i>run through the pit of his stomach!</i>

22
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,880
<i>"Is This the End!? A Brutally</i>
<i>Transcendent Power Attacks Gohan."</i>

23
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,870
Bungling jackass!

24
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,910
That's what you get for being
distracted by that Namekian kid!

25
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,060
K-Kakarrot, that smooth-headed one,

26
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,590
and so on, all those guys
from Earth take things too easily!

27
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,700
Oh, my fault, my fault.

28
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:46,730
It seems I have too much power,
and can't control myself all that well.

29
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,750
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

30
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,760
Who would have thought
you could still be this spirited?

31
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,930
Gohan...

32
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,940
How does that feel?

33
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,390
<i>Not yet? Not yet?</i>

34
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,770
<i>Dammit, not yet? Then how long?</i>

35
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,430
Calm down, Yamucha!

36
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,440
It's not good to get so carried away!

37
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,440
How am I supposed to be calm about this?

38
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,540
Right now, Goku and Kuririn and the others

39
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,780
are off fighting for their
lives against someone so awful,

40
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,450
they don't know if they can beat him or not!

41
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,260
And yet, here I am, so far away...

42
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,520
I want to go and fight as well.

43
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,360
However, getting worked up won't help.

44
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,030
Goku and Piccolo are sure to do well!

45
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:01,400
You must realize the only thing we
can do is to continue our training now,

46
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,900
so that if we do get to Namek, we'll
be able to fight as hard as we'd like to.

47
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,430
<i>Goku, after how I warned you</i>
<i>against getting near Freeza...</i>

48
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:31,270
<i>He wields enough terrifying</i>
<i>power to destroy the entire universe!</i>

49
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,070
Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

50
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,880
What is it, you guys? Why aren't you training?

51
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,740
What is the matter?
You are so absorbed in thought.

52
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,410
Your face is so pallid. Are you all right?

53
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,750
M-My face has been this color since birth!

54
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:55,390
I-I trust nothing bad has
happened on Planet Namek?

55
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,060
Is it Goku?

56
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,590
Or maybe Piccolo?

57
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,750
I'm finished!

58
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,050
I've had it! I want a bed! I want a shower!

59
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,430
I want cake with strawberries,
and lots of strawberry cake!

60
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:39,270
I want to be a cloud, too.

61
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,610
Oh dear, that looks just like Kuririn!

62
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,020
Speaking of which, what could he possibly
be dilly-dallying around about right now?

63
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,720
I mean, really!

64
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,860
I don't suppose they could've left me
behind and gone back to Earth, could they?

65
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,860
Or maybe they've been wiped
out by Vegeta, or that Freeza guy!

66
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,430
No, that couldn't be! I mean,
Son<i>-kun</i> is here, after all!

67
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,100
They're okay, for sure!

68
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,080
They're okay...

69
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,830
<i>So, this is the end for me? What a shame!</i>

70
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,370
<i>I wanted to get married, even just once...</i>

71
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,380
<i>Kuririn's ki is dropping rapidly.</i>

72
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,880
<i>Hold on just a while longer, everyone.</i>

73
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,090
<i>Just until I've fully recovered. Please!</i>

74
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,400
So, you've finally snuffed it, then?

75
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,410
Kuririn...

76
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,240
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

77
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,420
So fast!

78
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,200
You're thinking of saving him?

79
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,230
It's pointless, he'll die momentarily.

80
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,380
How about instead,

81
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,580
you worry about your own safety?

82
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,050
Then again, you can worry all you like,

83
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,750
it doesn't matter if you're a Namekian...

84
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,760
...or an Earthling...

85
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,830
...or a Saiyan...

86
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,030
...it won't, of course, change
the fact that you're going to die.

87
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,730
Out...

88
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,620
Out of my way!!

89
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,390
What?!

90
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,060
<i>That kid's power is rising so fast!</i>

91
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,110
<i>How can this be? Such incredible energy!</i>

92
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,220
<i>I can't believe it!</i>

93
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,050
<i>When that kid loses his</i>
<i>senses and flies off the handle,</i>

94
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,260
<i>he can call up that much power?!</i>

95
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,890
<i>U-Unbelievable!</i>

96
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,770
H-He may be closer to becoming
a Super Saiyan than anyone else!

97
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,780
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

98
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,630
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

99
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,270
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

100
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,610
It's okay! He's managed to hang on!

101
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,950
Don't die, Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

102
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,950
We don't have time to be worrying about him!

103
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,120
Do you think Freeza would die from just that?

104
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,260
You aren't any ordinary runt, are you?

105
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Even I found that to be a little bit painful!

106
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,970
You did that to the wrong person.

107
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,970
Of course, like I said before, the
fact that you're going to die remains.

108
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,810
For all your effort, you've
only managed to incur my wrath.

109
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,950
O-Oh, hell.

110
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,920
It looks like we were
hoping for too much after all.

111
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,120
Now we're a laughingstock!

112
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:15,150
Impossible! His <i>ki</i> just keeps
growing stronger and stronger!

113
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,630
<i>Who could have known he</i>
<i>can control his battle power?!</i>

114
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:26,060
I will take the pain I have felt,

115
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,090
and return it to you many times over!

116
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,580
<i>Freeza's power just billowed up suddenly!</i>

117
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,950
<i>At this rate, everyone will be...</i>

118
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,460
You idiot! Get out of there!

119
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,610
Oh no, don't you suffer any damage just yet.

120
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,950
The fun is just beginning, after all.

121
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,290
You're just a kid after all, aren't you?
Is that the extent of your power?

122
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,070
Fool! You got full of yourself
and dropped your guard, didn't you?

123
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,400
You caught all of that blast!

124
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,780
All right!

125
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:50,780
Once again! I'll pound you
with yet another intensive shot!

126
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,960
Take this!

127
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,260
And you said I wasn't
going to be a match for you!

128
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,640
You look awfully stupid now, Freeza<i>-san.</i>

129
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,630
Don't be in such a hurry, Vegeta.

130
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,470
Once I finish with the runt, I'll
have plenty of time to play with you.

131
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,310
Our fates are sealed...

132
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,600
So then, how would you
like me to deal with you, hmm?

133
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,250
He's gone!

134
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,450
Here I am!

135
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,770
What's wrong? Can't you move?

136
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:42,250
This is where it ends, isn't it?

137
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,950
Die!

138
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,640
<i>Gohan's ki is falling rapidly!</i>

139
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,480
<i>I'm coming! Wait there, Gohan!</i>

140
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,150
<i>Gohan...</i>

141
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,920
<i>Gohan's death draws near.</i>
<i>But what of Piccolo? What of Goku?</i>

142
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,800
<i>Can those that love him do anything to save him?</i>

143
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,750
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

144
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:54,590
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

145
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,960
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

146
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,460
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

147
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,970
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

148
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:16,080
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

149
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,580
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

150
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,250
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

151
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:29,760
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

152
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,830
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

153
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,660
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

154
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,670
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
