<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,720
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,970
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:36,730
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:43,280
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,160

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:04,670
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,130
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,270
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,000
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,690
Why, you!

17
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,730
You're not taking this seriously, are you?!

18
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,940
I did say this would
just be warming up, didn't I?

19
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,290
When I have become
Super Vegeta, do not mock me!!

20
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,330
What?!

21
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,700
<i>Even a kick with Vegeta's full power behind it...</i>

22
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,120
<i>...has absolutely no effect on Cell.</i>

23
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,710
<i>Super Vegeta is in an ultra-pinch!</i>

24

<i>"Breaking Through the Boundaries of the</i>
<i>Super Saiyan!! Trunks Summons a Storm."</i>

25
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:09,730
Vegeta's attack had to have
struck Cell's vital point flawlessly.

26
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,900
And yet, Cell has taken no damage whatsoever!

27
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,080
<i>I-Is that how much difference</i>
<i>there is in their powers now?</i>

28
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,120
What's the matter?

29
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,290
Where's all that enthusiasm
you had up until now?

30
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,730
M-My...

31
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,110
...my kick had the power
of my whole body behind it...!

32
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,700
W-Why?!

33
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,290
What's the matter? Smile, Vegeta!

34
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,370
Well, well. I suppose I'll
have to return your remark...

35
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,160
...that there is too great
a difference between us,

36
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,530
and this fight is dull.

37
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,480
W-What are you doing, Trunks?

38
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,060
If you don't hurry up and help him,
Vegeta really is going to die!

39
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,110
If he dies, he won't be able to give
you any business about his pride!

40
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:10,040
W-When Dad loses consciousness
fighting Cell, then I'll step in to help.

41
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,250
Having lost consciousness,

42
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,880
I can get away without having to
have Dad see that I've surpassed him.

43
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,500
Are you still worried about that?

44
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,920
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

45
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,220
For Dad, pride is something you cannot be without!

46
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,720
Dad without his pride
would not be Dad at all!

47
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,060
That's what makes Dad even stronger...

48
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,470
...as well as making him more solitary.

49
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:38,070
However, I'm sure it's that
part of Dad that attracted Mom!

50
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,480
And me, as well!

51
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,070
Trunks...

52
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,450
Fine then, assuming he doesn't get
killed before losing consciousness.

53
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,090
You scum.

54
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:09,970
Vegeta, unfortunately it seems
you'll be finished while I'm warming up.

55
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,970
Y-You piece of crap...!

56
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:18,900
Before we part ways,
I must express my gratitude...

57
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,110
...to the degree of your foolishness that
assisted me in becoming my perfect form.

58
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,760
Don't go exerting any uncalled-for effort,

59
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,310
when you know what
the outcome will be, No. 16.

60
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:02,190
You are no longer anything
more than a powerless pile of junk.

61
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,660
D-Dad!

62
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,750
W-What is he planning to do?

63
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,910
D-Dad!

64
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,870
Cell!!

65
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,130
No matter that you may
have attained your perfect form,

66
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,380
do you still have the
courage to catch this head-on?!

67
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,480
It's too much for you, I bet!

68
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,230
You're nothing but a pantywaist!

69
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,860
H-He's provoking Cell!

70
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,030
To keep him from avoiding the attack!

71
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,660
Y-You've got to be kidding!

72
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,910
D-Does he really intend to
unleash that technique here on Earth?!

73
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,100
Please don't do it!!

74
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:09,270
The Earth...!! The Earth itself will be...!!

75
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,440
Get out of there, Trunks!

76
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,440
Final Flash!

77
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,280
H-Holy s–!

78
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,610
I'm so hungry!

79
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,700
Let's see, this... and this, and this.

80
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,910
Gohan likes this one, after all. Okay!

81
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,760
Gohan!

82
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,100
It's about time for us to eat!

83
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,140
Right!

84
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,770
After all, if you don't keep
your body in good health,

85
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,070
I'll get Chichi mad at me, too!

86
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,070
Right.

87
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,360
Okay. Gohan, cook this for me.

88
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,040
Thank you!

89
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,630
Y-Your hair...

90
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,470
Gohan, you have to hurry and
learn how to control your power, huh?

91
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,680
Y-Yes...

92
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,520
Ee-yow!

93
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,510
W-We survived...!

94
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,760
Dad calculated perfectly, and
narrowed his range down just right!

95
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,570
I-It paid off!

96
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:08,680
Take that!

97
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,470
N-No...!

98
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,610
H-He did it! H-He really did it!

99
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,490
Y-Yeah...!

100
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,630
S-Something like this... c-can't happen!

101
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:46,300
It can't happen! Not to my perfect form!

102
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,340
Damn it to hell!!

103
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,310
Gotcha!

104
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,810
You're laughing a fool's laugh!

105
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,860
Have you forgotten that
I have inherited Piccolo's blood?

106
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,130
Disappointed?

107
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,680
T-This can't be...!

108
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,150
Now then, isn't it about time I killed you?

109
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,170
D-Dammit!

110
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,960
H-Hey... He's no longer S-Super Saiyan.

111
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,920
H-He's lost consciousness... Or else he's d-d–

112
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,470
You're tough, huh?

113
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,800
I'll put you out of your
misery right now, Vegeta.

114
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,720
Trunks! It's now or never!

115
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,810
Now's the time to become
that drastic Super Saiyan!

116
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,820
Hey, now...

117
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,610
T-Trunks?

118
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:29,020
Hey, Trunks?

119
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,520
Are you all right? Hey!

120
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,830
And so, this is where it ends, Vegeta.

121
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,490
<i>At last, Trunks' Ultra-Power is unleashed!</i>

122
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,870
<i>Take that power that surpasses the Saiyan wall,</i>

123
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,580
<i>and use it to take down Cell here and now!</i>

124
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,180
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

125
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,020
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

126
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,400
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

127
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,910
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

128
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,370
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

129
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,500
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

130
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,010
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

131
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,630
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

132
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:29,140
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

133
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,230
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

134
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,060
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

135
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,070
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

136
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:44,740
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

137
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,910
<i>So sorry.</i>

138
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,080
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

139
00:23:54,790 --> 00:24:00,090
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

140
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,100
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

141
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,600
<i>Vegeta, Trunks is fighting</i>
<i>Cell with awesome power.</i>

142
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,610
<i>He's gotten a lot stronger than you.</i>

143
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,610
<i>Kuririn-san, take Dad and get</i>
<i>him someplace far away, quickly.</i>

144
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:24,110
<i>You need not worry about me,</i>
<i>because I will be sure to win.</i>

145
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,070
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

146

<i>that has surpassed Super Saiyan?</i>

148
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,460
"Next time"
