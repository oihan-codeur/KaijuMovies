<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:24,670
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,930
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,690
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,230
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:52,120
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,620
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:04,630
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,090
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,220
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,600
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:26,570
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,110
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,950
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:54,180
<i>Burning with ambition to achieve his perfect form,</i>

17
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:58,850
<i>Cell has launched an indiscriminate</i>
<i>attack, in order to absorb No. 18,</i>

18
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,100
<i>who has hidden herself together with No. 16.</i>

19
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,550
<i>Elsewhere, having finished their</i>
<i>training in the Room of Spirit and Time,</i>

20
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:34,260
<i>Vegeta and Trunks were</i>
<i>headed toward Cell at ultra-speed.</i>

21
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:52,740
Cell, it appears you're making
quite a show about going into action.

22
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,620
<i>Son Goku and Gohan, father and son,</i>
<i>have entered the Room of Spirit and Time.</i>

23
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,460
<i>Will they indeed be able to surpass Super Saiyan?</i>

24
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:20,640
<i>"Suddenly Full-Throttle!!</i>
<i>The Super Power of a Radiant Vegeta."</i>

25
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,500
It's no use, no matter how well you're hiding!

26
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,370
You won't get out of this by
concealing yourself, No. 18!

27
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,140
Are you saying that that
isn't him being serious?!

28
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,470
Yeah, I am.

29
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,410
At this rate, it's only a
matter of time before he finds us.

30
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,050
You sure are an odd one.

31
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
No. 18... No matter what,

32
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,460
I will absorb you and
become my perfect form.

33
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,050
That is the reason I came
here from the future, after all.

34
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,240
<i>That's the level of Cell's battle power?</i>

35
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,410
<i>Kakarrot and you guys,</i>
<i>what were you so frightened of?</i>

36
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,420
<i>Dad's ki has risen.</i>

37
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,510
<i>To think that he's capable of</i>
<i>putting out that much ki so easily!</i>

38
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,740
I don't know how much Vegeta
and Trunks have powered up,

39
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,250
but Cell's power is nothing ordinary.

40
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,460
He's of a different dimension!

41
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,670
If Cell were to absorb No. 18
and become his perfect form

42
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,500
before Goku finishes his special training...

43
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,470
...then not even Goku can beat him.

44
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,850
It could be the end.

45
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:54,310
Damn! My entire life, one
day has never felt so long!

46
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,320
You're a fine man!
What are you wavering about?!

47
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,030
Son-<i>kun</i> is the strongest in the universe!

48
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,280
He will win for sure!

49
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,860
That's just how it's
going to be! You got that?!

50
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,040
Oh, there, there, don't cry!

51
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,870
Trunks, you're a big boy,
right? You're fine, you're fine!

52
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,460
E-Everything is snow-white!

53
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,220
M-My body feels heavy too,

54
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,390
and it's so hot that it's hard to breathe.

55
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,850
Once the doorway to the outside is closed,

56
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:31,850
any contact from the outside
world is completely shut out.

57
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,810
See? You can't sense either
Cell's <i>ki</i> or Vegeta's <i>ki</i> any more, right?

58
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,230
It's true! I don't feel a thing!

59
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,700
Over there is the bath and the toilet.

60
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,410
This is the food storeroom.

61
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,420
There's a year's worth of food in here.

62
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,040
What do you think?

63
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,050
So, even my big-eating
father will be all right, huh?

64
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,050
Gohan, we've covered just about everything.

65
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:08,010
Right! It looks like I'll be
able to make it through like this.

66
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,010
Really? Go take a look out back.

67
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,060
You'll understand
what I meant when I said...

68
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,440
...it was too tough for me to stay
here even a month when I was a kid!

69
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,070
W-What's going on?!

70
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,870
We're inside a room, yet
the place is this expansive!

71
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,040
What's more, there's nothing there!

72
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,880
I hear it's about as big as the Earth!

73
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,130
I-It can't be!

74
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,610
You haven't come out, huh?

75
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,990
You must surely be on one
of the islands around here.

76
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,030
It seems you understand that it
won't do any good to escape underwater.

77
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,080
Anyhow, it appears I can't do anything else

78
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,870
but examine the entire ocean in this area.

79
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,160
Don't shoot!

80
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,790
You will be detected by Cell!

81
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,500
Dammit!

82
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,190
He's finally arrived at the next island over!

83
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,230
Calm down!

84
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,360
Cell is only looking for
anything that leaves the islands!

85
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Just sit still like this and hang on!

86
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,910
You at least will be spared!

87
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,060
That single island there is all that remains.

88
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,520
One left...

89
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,040
He's coming!

90
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,080
Calm down!

91
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,750
Don't give up until the end!

92
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:29,170
If you are absorbed,
it will be the end of everything!

93
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,310
Well, you better come on out, No. 18!

94
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,990
You're... Vegeta!

95
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,620
So you're Cell?

96
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,000
Land!

97
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,470
Vegeta...?

98
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,000
What have you come all this way for?

99
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,630
Don't tell me you've come to make jokes,

100
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,430
such as you have come
to defeat me, have you?

101
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,680
I haven't come to defeat you.

102
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,180
I'm going to knock you into so many pieces

103
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,010
there won't be anything left afterward.

104
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,680
Me? <i>You</i>?

105
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,810
Amusing.

106
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,650
I'm shocked to think that
my cells were being used...

107
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,820
...by a repulsive monster such as yourself!

108
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,820
I wonder if you were supposed
to have turned out a little better.

109
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,830
They're being used by me,
the strongest in the universe!

110
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,420
Just for that, you should be honored.

111
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,000
Not so, monster!

112
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,380
You are not the strongest in the universe.

113
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,390
That would be me,
the prince of the Saiyans, Vegeta!

114
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,800
What is he, stupid?

115
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,560
What can someone who was
so utterly helpless against me

116
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
now do against Cell?

117
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,370
Trunks, huh?

118
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,880
There's been quite a change about you.

119
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,010
Well, it doesn't matter to
me how many of you may come.

120
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,390
If you like, shall I wait
for even more to arrive?

121
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,390
He's just a spectator.

122
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:31,390
I alone will be sufficient to bury you.

123
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,400
What was that?

124
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,400
Did you say that you alone were sufficient?

125
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,780
That's right! Got any problem with it?!

126
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,200
I've got no problem.

127
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,950
I'm just astounded by
how absurd you're being!

128
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,030
Cell is right!

129
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:50,290
No matter what may happen,
Vegeta is no match for him!

130
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,750
Still, No. 16, this may be our chance to escape!

131
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:57,250
Hey, No. 16!

132
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,260
Wait! We only move
once the fighting has started.

133
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,090
Besides which, it's strange.

134
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,970
Vegeta's battle power
has gone up a great deal

135
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,930
since that time previously.

136
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,390
Ridiculous!

137
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,940
There's no way it could change
all that much in this short a time!

138
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,190
He didn't look like he was
holding back or anything...

139
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,960
Watch very carefully, Cell!

140
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,830
I'm going to erase that disagreeable
little smile of yours for you!

141
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,680
<i>Dad's planning on changing right off...</i>

142
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,180
...into <i>that.</i>

143
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,370
It's begun! His <i>ki</i> is rapidly...

144
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,200
...rapidly increasing.

145
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,870
S-Such a terrific <i>ki</i>...!

146
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:34,020
Let's have a look, Vegeta,

147
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,600
at this power that goes
even beyond Super Saiyan.

148
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,160
Be careful!

149
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,870
If you go too far away,

150
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,000
you might not be able to find
your way back here, get lost and die!

151
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,710
R-Right!

152
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,550
The temperature varies from
50 degrees to minus 40 degrees.

153
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,590
The air is about one-fourth that of Earth,

154
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,390
and the gravity is about 10 times
greater in this pure-white world.

155
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,010
It's gonna be awful!

156
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:17,270
O-O-One year in a place like this?

157
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,020
Gohan, we start training right away!

158
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,610
We didn't come here to play!

159
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,170
How about it? Awfully terrible, ain't it?

160
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,590
This is the first time you've
ever done gravity training, huh?

161
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:48,130
Well, you'll get used to it soon.

162
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,220
Right!

163
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,600
First of all, Gohan, we're
going to make you a Super Saiyan.

164
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,400
–S-Super Saiyan?
–Yeah.

165
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,280
I-I'm not sure I can
become a Super Saiyan...

166
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,610
Of course you can!

167
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,490
You've inherited genuine Saiyan blood!

168
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,280
We've got to make you a Super Saiyan.

169
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,790
Then we'll start the full-fledged training.

170
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,160
But, isn't it possible that

171
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
I will get in the way
of your training, Father?

172
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah, at first.

173
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,970
But then, Gohan, if you can so
much as become Super Saiyan,

174
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,470
you'll be much more
help to me as a drill partner!

175
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,430
You are my son.

176
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,190
Have faith in yourself!

177
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,810
Okay?

178
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,150
R-Right!

179
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,400
Okay.

180
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,820
Naturally, I intend to obtain
power beyond Super Saiyan!

181
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,820
I want to be stronger
than anyone else, after all!

182
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:59,370
But Gohan, I intend to
have you even surpass me!

183
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,370
M-Me surpass you, Father?

184
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,380
That's right. That's my ideal.

185
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,380
I'm positive it will happen!

186
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,380
I-I wonder...

187
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,380
Trunks-<i>san</i> said, you know,

188
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,010
that in the future I will become a Super Saiyan,

189
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,180
and get killed by the Artificial Humans.

190
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,180
What are you talking about?

191
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,350
Things have already changed
considerably from Trunks' future, ain't they?

192
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,190
I'm here, alive and well.

193
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,990
Besides that, the you that died in
the future never trained in here, right?

194
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,360
That's right!

195
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,870
It's all up to your own determination!

196
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,830
Father, if you please!

197
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,830
All right, that's the spirit!

198
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm going to be far more hard
on you than Piccolo was, you know!

199
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,500
–Prepare yourself!
–Right!

200
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:08,600
D-Don't tell me it's still increasing!

201
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,120
What is that?!

202
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,620
How can Vegeta have that kind of power?

203
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,450
I don't believe it!

204
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,120
Is training in the Room of Spirit
and Time as magnificent as all this?

205
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,750
Say, what's wrong?

206
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:17,010
What's happened to Vegeta?
Trunks is okay, right?

207
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,680
W-What is this?!

208
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,650
<i>Without a doubt, he has</i>
<i>surpassed Super Saiyan.</i>

209
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,990
<i>Vegeta's super power explodes,</i>
<i>exceeding even that of the monstrous Cell!</i>

210
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,910
<i>Can this be the power</i>
<i>that surpasses Super Saiyan?</i>

211
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,310
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

212
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:53,150
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

213
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,520
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

214
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,990
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

215
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,500
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

216
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:14,630
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

217
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,130
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

218
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,760
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

219
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:28,260
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

220
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,350
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

221
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,190
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

222
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,190
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

223
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,860
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

224
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,030
<i>So sorry.</i>

225
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,160
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

226
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:59,170
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

227
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:11,270
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

228
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:14,060
<i>Nice going, Vegeta! Incredible power!</i>

229
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,560
<i>All right, Gohan, let's not get left behind.</i>

230
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,440
<i>What's the matter, Cell?</i>
<i>Take this more seriously!</i>

231
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,070
<i>If you're this weak, then all that</i>
<i>training I did will be meaningless.</i>

232
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,070
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

233
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,410
<i>"On Your Knees, Cell!</i>
<i>I Am Super Vegeta!!"</i>

234
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,330
<i>Wow! His power is incredible,</i>
<i>but his self-confidence is amazing, too!</i>

235
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,580
"Next time"
"On Your Knees, Cell!
I Am Super Vegeta!!"
