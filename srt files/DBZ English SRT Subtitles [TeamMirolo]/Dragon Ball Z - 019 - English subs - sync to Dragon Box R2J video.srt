H-Huh? Who are you?

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,520

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:38,120
Eh, there's a mosquito...

Then, who is... huh?

33
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,440
That there is my pet, Bubbles<i>-kun.</i>

34
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,040
Ohhh...

35
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,180
I thought it was a little strange.

36
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,880
You're the strange one.

37
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,110
By the way...

38
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,750
Don't you think that play on
words just now was the greatest?

39
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,130
You don't have to be afraid to laugh at it.

40
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,230
At what?

41
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,700
You were too tense to hear it, huh?

42
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,700
What am I going to do
with you, for pity's sake?

43
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,370
Well then, at no extra charge,
I'll hit you with a different play on words.

44
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,550
Hello? Hello?

45
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,380
Huh? I picked up the <i>phone,</i>
but no one was <i>home</i>!

46
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,660
That's great!

47
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,460
What was?

48
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,930
What did you come here for?

49
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:59,040
Oh, I was hoping to
have you train me, Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

50
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,410
Train you?!

51
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,710
Go home now!

52
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,910
Anyone who hears a joke like that
and doesn't laugh has a flawed character!

53
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:10,180
You expect me to train anyone like that?!

54
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,560
That was hilarious! I should
have expected as much, Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

55
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,620
I ain't ever heard anything so funny!

56
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,660
It was, wasn't it?

57
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,260
You were just slow to notice it, that's all.

58
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,700
Are you going to train me?

59
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,670
Train you, huh? I wouldn't mind doing that.

60
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,910
Really?!

61
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,680
Provided that...

62
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,450
...you can pass my test.

63
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,280
You have to make me,
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, the mastermind of gags,

64
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,160
laugh at one of your plays on words.

65
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,460
I have to make a play on words?!

66
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,490
Are you getting cold feet?

67
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:55,830
If the pun is not at an adequate
enough level, I won't laugh at it.

68
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,070
Well, how about it?

69
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,170
Apparently, you're not up to it.
If that's so, then give up, and go home!

70
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:11,110
M-My <i>futon...</i>

71
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,140
<i>flew</i> away, <i>gone</i>!

72
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,160
Your <i>futon... flew</i> away <i>gone</i>?!

73
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,290
<i>Just a little more!</i>

74
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,690
My feline...

75
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,930
...has gone supine!

76
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,430
My stylus is sightless!

77
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:43,410
Ah, you laughed! Kaio<i>-sama</i>, you laughed!

78
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,910
My <i>futon flew</i> away, <i>gone</i>!

79
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,890
You're no slouch at this, huh?
You're a pro, aren't you?

80
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,900
Very well, I will give you
my training. I will teach you...

81
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,370
...my greatest gag!

82
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,270
N-Never mind the gags,
teach me martial arts.

83
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:16,780
What, you want to learn martial arts?
Why didn't you say so sooner?

84
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,410
All right, come at me! I want to
see what kind of skill you possess.

85
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,750
What's the matter?!

86
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,420
It's just that there's
something strange going on.

87
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,690
It's awfully hard to move,
and my body feels so heavy.

88
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,290
Where did you come from, Earth?

89
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,100
Then it would be heavy here, huh?

90
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,900
This is a small planet,
but it has incredible gravity, see?

91
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,270
I'll bet it's about ten
times what it is on your planet.

92
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,940
That means your own
weight is ten times greater.

93
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,780
See how high you can jump.
As hard as you can.

94
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,650
O-Okay...

95
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,500
It's no use! That little
bit is as high as I can go!

96
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,660
<i>If he can jump that high</i>
<i>in ten times his normal gravity...</i>

97
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,540
<i>This guy here has a lot of promise!</i>

98
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,670
Okay then, we will start your training.

99
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,910
How much time do you plan to spend with me?

100
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:30,120
I ain't sure how many days it took
for me to run down the Serpentine Road...

101
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,680
But I don't think I have much time.

102
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,490
I'm told that there are these
Saiyan guys who are coming to our

103
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,790
planet to do some awful stuff.

104
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,990
So I'd like for you to train me
until that time, however short it is!

105
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,330
Saiyans, huh?

106
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,000
You've had some nasty folks set
their sights on you, all right. Well then...

107
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,270
I'll check into when these Saiyans
are going to reach Earth for you.

108
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,520
The Saiyans are flying that way, all right.

109
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:19,800
They will arrive on Earth in...
let's see... about 158 days, I'd say.

110
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,800
Awesome! You can tell that?!

111
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,940
Yeah, these handy antenna
are reliable, <i>an' tenna</i> some!

112
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,040
That was great!

113
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:38,760
Maybe I should give up training you.

114
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,690
That was great!
That was great! That was great!

115
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,690
Wasn't it?

116
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,430
Still, there's only 158 days
until the Saiyans arrive, huh?

117
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,300
Hey, 158 days will be plenty.

118
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,270
Me training you on this planet
for 158 days will have the same value

119
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,840
as if you trained for
a thousand years on Earth.

120
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,710
Really?!

121
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,280
However...

122
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,910
Even if you do train with me,

123
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,780
there's no guarantee that you
will be able to beat the Saiyans.

124
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,050
The two Saiyans that are headed for
Earth have just that much awesome power.

125
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,660
To be honest with you, their
strength is even greater than my own.

126
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,590
Even greater than yours, Kaio<i>-sama</i>?!

127
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,260
That's right.

128
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,800
Which means that if you
cannot at least surpass me,

129
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,330
it will be impossible
for you to beat the Saiyans.

130
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,780
Okay then, how about
we get started right away?

131
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:40,280
Hey! Bubbles<i>-kun</i>!

132
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,960
First off...

133
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,330
...you have to conquer the harsh gravity here.
Catch Bubbles<i>-kun</i> here, if you can.

134
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,730
For the time being, until you
can move fast enough to do that,

135
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,430
nothing else will matter.

136
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
A-All right...

137
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,340
Okay, run away, Bubbles<i>-kun</i>!

138
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,610
Wait up!

139
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,370
Damn! My body is really heavy!

140
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,670
Dammit! All right, then...

141
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,870
Watch this!

142
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,490
I'm going to get you!

143
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,320
Ho! So he's already wearing
super-weighted gear, is he?

144
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,370
That makes me quite a bit lighter, now!

145
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:17,750
Hold it!

146
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,710
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

147
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,130
All right, you're mine!

148
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,740
It can't be! You're kidding me, right?

149
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,270
What do you think?

150
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:47,270
He sure is fast! I'm not sure I can catch him.

151
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,940
If you can't, then go home right now.

152
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,050
That's right–I ain't eaten anything
since I left the Snake Princess' place.

153
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,390
Say, I hate to ask, but could
you give me something to eat?

154
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:08,930
Well, okay. That's unusual–
a hungry deceased person...

155
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,620
Hey, how about showing a little restraint?

156
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm <i>down</i> ing the <i>donburi</i>!

157
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,300
<i>Down</i> ing the <i>donburi</i>!

158
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,840
Where's the joke there?

159
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm full, I'm full!

160
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,610
The taste notwithstanding,
at least my stomach is full!

161
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:59,010
I get the feeling that maybe this
man isn't giving me enough respect.

162
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,810
By the way, Kaio<i>-sama,</i>

163
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,980
I'm surprised you don't find it
dull staying on a planet this small.

164
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,020
So young...

165
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:13,050
If you set your mind to it, there are
any number of fun things to do here.

166
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,630
Like counting how many
blades of grass there are growing...

167
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,630
gazing up at the sky...

168
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,870
long-distance peeing...

169
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:28,510
Recently, I've been
getting into a new hobby...

170
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,710
Going for drives.

171
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,020
Now, hurry up and catch Bubbles<i>-kun.</i>

172
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,460
Otherwise, you'll never be able to
get me to teach you any martial arts.

173
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,030
Right! I'll give it my all!

174
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,790
All righty!

175
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,360
Oh, right!

176
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,970
Put on those heavy-looking clothes and boots
you took off earlier and then run after him.

177
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,640
That will be more effective.

178
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,640
But putting that stuff on
makes it even harder to run!

179
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,640
Let me tell you something.

180
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,090
The planet that the Saiyans are
from had about the same gravity as here.

181
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,050
That's where they built up <i>their</i> bodies.

182
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,590
Do you now understand part of
the secret to the Saiyans' strength?

183
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:21,590
But it's more than just that.

184
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,600
Saiyans are born with
a natural fighting sense.

185
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,630
That's another thing
that makes them so formidable.

186
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,870
Hey, that's fine! I'm a Saiyan, too!

187
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,590
Nice thrust.

188
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,500
Don't slow down your attack!

189
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,440
Uncle...

190
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,770
help me.

191
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,350
Don't be so needy, you dirty brat!

192
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,120
Sure enough, he only exhibits
those dormant abilities of his

193
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,850
on the night of the full moon.

194
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,000
Yow-ow-ow-ow...

195
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,280
Looks like you at least cured yourself of
being a crybaby over the last half-year, huh?

196
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,550
Say, Piccolo<i>-san</i>, you fought
with Father a long time ago, right?

197
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,980
Our fight is not yet over.

198
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,790
If we're able to defeat the Saiyans,
your father's turn comes next.

199
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,630
But Father told me that
the reincarnated Piccolo<i>-san</i>

200
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,900
didn't seem to be the same
terribly evil person he was before.

201
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,670
I sort of think that, too. Mother and
Grandpa are still afraid of you, though.

202
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,440
Stop talking nonsense and get to sleep!

203
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,610
Tomorrow, we won't have the
kind of gentle training we did today!

204
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,050
R-Right...

205
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,900
Damn him anyway...

206
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:47,270
<i>Since then, three weeks have</i>
<i>gone by in the blink of an eye...</i>

207
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,180
These <i>shao-mai</i> dumplings taste so good...

208
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,880
...that you'll say "they taste <i>s hao</i> good...

209
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,980
they taste <i>s hao</i> good," I think you'll find.

210
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,030
That was great! That was great!

211
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,360
Huh? Nobody heard that one?

212
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,040
Hold it!

213
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,600
Hold it! Hold it!

214
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,040
I've got <i>gyoza</i> by the gross!

215
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,140
Hold it!

216
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,020
Now!

217
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,590
So close!

218
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,280
All right!

219
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,610
He's in good spirits, huh?

220
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,450
Hold it!

221
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,750
He <i>definitely</i> doesn't have
the slightest respect for me!

222
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,600
Yow-ow-ow...

223
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,050
He really is incredible, huh?
But I'm not giving in!

224
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,280
Hold up!

225
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm so close!

226
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,670
I know!

227
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,380
All right...

228
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,740
Hold it!

229
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,980
Bubbles<i>-kun</i>, I found you!

230
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:23,720
Hold it!

231
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,840
I did it!

232
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,580
Wow! I finally did it! I caught him!

233
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:54,950
<i>He's as amazing as I thought.</i>
<i>He's already overcome the gravity here, has he?</i>

234
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:00,300
<i>He might be able to handle it!</i>
<i>The Kaio-ken technique...</i>

235
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,830
<i>The Saiyans' assault is not far away.</i>

236
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,510
<i>What kind of training will</i>
<i>Goku receive from Kaio-sama,</i>

237
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,680
<i>now that he has finally met him?</i>

238
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,010
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

239
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:53,880
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

240
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,250
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

241
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,750
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

242
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,230
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

243
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,330
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

244
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:18,840
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

245
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,510
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

246
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:29,020
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

247
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,080
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

248
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,920
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

249
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,990
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

250
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:44,660
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

251
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,830
<i>So sorry.</i>

252
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,940
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

253
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:59,910
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

254
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,190
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

255
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,790
<i>That's fast! I ain't ever</i>
<i>seen anything that fast!</i>

256
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,730
<i>Gregory is that fast, huh?</i>

257
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,530
<i>Then again, the foes that you</i>
<i>have to fight are even faster.</i>

258
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,400
<i>Kaio-sama, you know about the Saiyans?</i>

259
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,200
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

260
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,640
<i>"The Saiyan Legend Reborn! Goku's Roots."</i>

261
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,250
<i>Father, do you really think</i>
<i>I can become a great scholar?</i>

262
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:37,650
"Next time"
"The Saiyan Legend Reborn! Goku's Roots"
