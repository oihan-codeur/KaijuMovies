<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,920
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,550
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,850
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,570
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,500

00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,510

<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,900
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,740
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,710
<i>Goku and Vegeta merged together</i>
<i>to give rise to the ultra-warrior Vegetto.</i>

24
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,590
<i>Vegetto, with his overwhelming strength,</i>

25
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,930
<i>avoided Majin Boo's attacks,</i>
<i>and instead finally hammered on him!</i>

26
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,580
<i>And then, Vegetto finally</i>
<i>had the Majin cornered.</i>

27
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,250
<i>However, Majin Boo played his</i>
<i>nastiest ace, and absorbed Vegetto!</i>

28
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,960
<i>Had Vegetto gotten careless?</i>
<i>Or instead, was this part of his strategy?</i>

29
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,610
<i>"A Demonic Maze!!</i>
<i>What Is There Inside Boo's Belly!?"</i>

30
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,170
Take that! You're finished
now, you piece of crap!

31
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,010
Eliminate me, you say?

32
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,300
Now that you've been eliminated instead,
you can't cause me any more trouble!

33
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,480
I-It's over...

34
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:55,240
It's all over now. There is no
other means of saving the universe.

35
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,710
In the end, even as a Kaioshin,
I was unable to do anything... I... I...

36
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,550
No, we don't know that.

37
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,720
Don't you think it's a little strange?

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,180
Strange?

39
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,180
Here, have a close look.

40
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,900
Up till now, every time
Majin Boo has absorbed a warrior,

41
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,730
he has powered up, and his
form has changed. But this time...

42
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,740
H-He hasn't changed!

43
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,200
He's the same as he was before
he absorbed Goku-<i>san</i> and company!

44
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,740
W-What could this mean?

45
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:40,710
I-I'm not too sure.
Maybe this is different–and if so...

46
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,710
...that guy is really something else!

47
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,560
That was a close one!

48
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,720
Goku-<i>san</i>... Vegeta-<i>san...</i>

49
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,190
H-Hey, what the hell is
going to happen to Earth?!

50
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:15,200
There are no longer any warriors
left that can fight Majin Boo.

51
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,200
All that is left is to wait around
quietly for Majin Boo to destroy us.

52
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,080
That's ridiculous! You're in
together with that man Goku, right?

53
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,710
So don't you lay claim to
some trick that can do something?!

54
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:32,170
I'm sorry. I am not a fighter-type,
and so I wouldn't be able to...

55
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,550
Damn!

56
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,180
Hey! Hey! Hey!

57
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,100
He has come back!

58
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,580
So, I've already gone around once, huh?
What a puny planet.

59
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,580
It's not even worth destroying like this.

60
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,580
Never mind that, what's going on?

61
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,880
Even though I've absorbed that guy,
there has been no change at all.

62
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,590
Why is that?

63
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,600
No matter. In any case,
he's still been absorbed by me.

64
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,480
Now, I have without question become peerless
among all worlds–the mightiest of Majin!

65
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:36,610
There is no longer anyone in
existence who can stand in my way!

66
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:41,490
I can enjoy the death and suffering of
any living thing to my heart's content!

67
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,660
Looks like I was more or less
successful in making my way inside here.

68
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,680
How annoying! How long is he
going to go on laughing like a fool?

69
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,770
Being inside him, I guess there's
no helping it being so noisy.

70
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,230
Never mind that, my barrier
seems to have indeed worked well.

71
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,060
I've gotten away without
being absorbed by him.

72
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,030
All right, that's probably long enough.

73
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:04,070
I have to dispel this barrier and
quickly find Gohan and the others.

74
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,030
I have no idea how the
inside of Boo is made up.

75
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,080
I'm not sure I can find them.
It'd be nice if they aren't already dead.

76
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,420
Look! He let himself be
absorbed by Boo on purpose,

77
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,670
so he could save his
friends who were absorbed!

78
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,880
S-So that's it!

79
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,550
That's why, even though he
could have beaten him at any time,

80
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,050
he provoked Boo into absorbing him!

81
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,640
Incredible! How incredible he is!

82
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,080
H-Huh? How come the
moment we dropped the barrier,

83
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,580
our merging broke up as well?

84
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,420
How am I supposed to know that?

85
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,960
That's strange! They said
once you merge with the Potara,

86
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,470
you'd never return again
to the original two persons.

87
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,640
Come to think of it, you
did say something about that.

88
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,310
In that case, it's lucky that this happened.

89
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,480
I am not about to merge with you ever again!

90
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,650
H-Hey! What are you doing?!
Don't take off your Potara!

91
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,020
I'm sure that once we leave
Boo's body, we can merge again!

92
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,030
It's probably the awful air in
here that prevents us from merging.

93
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,290
Th-The Potara...!

94
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,840
V-Vegeta! How could you do that?!

95
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,460
Now we ain't capable of
merging again, you know!

96
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,260
On top of that, you're dead!

97
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,470
Unless you're merged, you'll have
to go back to the Other World, right?!

98
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,980
Hmph! I'll take that
over being merged with you!

99
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,480
Besides, there's no need
to merge again, is there?

100
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,770
You don't know that!

101
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,780
Even if we do rescue everyone
who has been absorbed successfully,

102
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:08,360
there ain't any guarantee
Boo will return to the way he was.

103
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,870
In that case, we'd better hope
that we can find our people fast,

104
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,620
and that everything goes right!

105
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,160
How can you...?

106
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,250
Come on, hurry it up! Boo may
intend to blow the Earth away!

107
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,710
I don't know about this!

108
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,040
Hey, wait up a bit! Hey!

109
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,560
You know, this is one nasty place.

110
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,730
Sure it is. We're inside something living, and
moreover, of all places, it's Majin Boo's belly.

111
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,730
<i>Sheesh! Whereabouts are we?! I can't tell at all!</i>

112
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,200
What?!

113
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,740
Vegeta!

114
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,290
W-W-What's this?!

115
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,980
What's going on?

116
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,490
This is...

117
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,670
Yeesh. Apparently we're inside his stomach.

118
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:31,170
What's this smoke?

119
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,630
Y-You idiot! That's his stomach acid!

120
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,680
If you're not quick, you'll
be dissolved without a trace!

121
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,770
What's that?

122
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,570
That bastard! He's planning on digesting us!

123
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,600
W-We're surrounded!

124
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,700
<i>Th-This is bad! If this keeps up...</i>

125
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,760
Stop! Vegeta!

126
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,560
Yow!

127
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,190
W-What was that just now?
Have I eaten something bad?

128
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,240
I know! This is because
I absorbed that strange guy!

129
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,780
It must be causing indigestion!

130
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,900
Hey, Vegeta, you sure are reckless!

131
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,240
What do you plan on
doing if Majin Boo finds us out?

132
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,780
After all the trouble it took to sneak in here!

133
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,290
Hmph! What do I care?
I saved us from being dissolved.

134
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,490
I'd rather you were grateful to me for that.

135
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,590
More importantly, you stay sharp, Kakarrot!

136
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,590
If we don't find Gohan and the others soon,

137
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,130
we won't be able to save the Earth that
we otherwise might have been able to.

138
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,170
I know!

139
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,860
Boy, doesn't this guy
eat anything but candy?

140
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,150
Everywhere you look, there are snacks!

141
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,620
Eating nothing but sweet things is
bad for the body, and makes you fat.

142
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,200
Stop saying such rubbish!

143
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,290
After shrugging off the pounding we gave him,

144
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:55,130
it'd be a big laugh if he were to
die from eating too much candy!

145
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,880
That's for sure!

146
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,720
What's wrong?

147
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,840
Silence!

148
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,730
What's that sound?

149
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,590
Above us?

150
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,800
What?!

151
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,220
What are these disgusting things?

152
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:06,280
That thing tried to dissolve me!

153
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,830
They've got incredible appetites!

154
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:22,920
Apparently, these things
break down what Majin Boo eats,

155
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,300
and supply him with nourishment.

156
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:57,670
S-Say, Vegeta, could it be that
these things are about to eat us?

157
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:03,130
If that's the case, let's show them
that we're not all that appetizing.

158
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,470
Y-You don't mean...?

159
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,340
Here they come!

160
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,860
Geez, these things are stubborn!

161
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,880
Hey, Vegeta, if you make
that big a commotion, Majin B–

162
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,390
Why, you rotten scum...!

163
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,570
Kakarrot!

164
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,360
What's that?!

165
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,580
What?

166
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,810
What is that monster?!

167
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,210
What the hell are you doing, Kakarrot?!
Tear those lower life forms off of you!

168
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,250
I know! But my body is...!

169
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:15,140
<i>Suddenly, Goku finds himself in a great pinch</i>
<i>with the giant monster that has appeared!</i>

170
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:20,600
<i>Will he be able to weather this pinch,</i>
<i>and rescue Gohan and the others?</i>

171
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,440
<i>There is barely any time remaining</i>
<i>before Majin Boo destroys the Earth!</i>

172
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,870
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

173
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,460
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

174
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:56,010
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

175
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:02,140
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

176
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,150
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

177
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:14,530
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

178
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,370
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

179
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:27,460
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

180
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,000
<i>Even now?</i>

181
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:36,630
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

182
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:42,010
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

183
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:48,520
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

184
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:58,570
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

185
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,510
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

186
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,970
<i>I've been looking for you, Gohan.</i>

187
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:21,140
<i>H-Hey, what's come over you,</i>
<i>suddenly attacking me like that?!</i>

188
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,600
<i>And over here are Gotenks and Piccolo!</i>

189
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,140
<i>Each one of them is screwing with us!</i>

190
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,310
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

191
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,310
<i>"Nightmares or Illusions!?</i>
<i>Goku and Gohan's Father-Son Confrontation."</i>

192
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,190
<i>Father, those aren't us! Be careful!</i>

193
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,650
"Next time"
"Nightmares or Illusions!?
Goku and Gohan's Father-Son Confrontation"
