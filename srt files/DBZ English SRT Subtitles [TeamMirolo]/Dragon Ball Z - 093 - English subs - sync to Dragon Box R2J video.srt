3
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:29,975
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:36,735
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:43,275
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,315 --> 00:00:52,165
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,685 --> 00:01:26,615
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

00:01:26,655 --> 00:01:30,155
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:37,045
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:38,995
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:10,995
<i>Dammit, I can't let myself</i>
<i>lose to the likes of him!</i>

17
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:13,165
<i>The terrifying Freeza...</i>

18
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:17,535
<i>What is this last card that Goku is playing?</i>

19
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:29,635
<i>This Genki Dama is the</i>
<i>last thing I wanted to use.</i>

20
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:31,475
<i>There'll probably be too much force to it!</i>

21
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:34,805
<i>It will be hard not to squash the planet itself!</i>

22
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:37,975
What's this you're doing?

23
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:42,645
You're still thinking of trying
some kind of nonsense, are you?

24
00:02:42,685 --> 00:02:46,525
What can you hope to
do as worn out as you are?

25
00:02:50,525 --> 00:02:52,745
<i>G-Genki Dama</i>!

26
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:54,785
It can't be! That giant thing?

27
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:08,965
<i>"Keep the Chance Alive!!</i>
<i>Piccolo's Suicide Support Strike."</i>

28
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,475
<i>What is it? What is he doing?</i>

29
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:42,475
<i>Why is he just standing there like</i>
<i>that, not showing any movement?</i>

30
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:47,485
<i>Grass, trees, and animals of Namek,</i>

31
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:51,815
<i>as well as all living things in</i>
<i>the universe, share your Genki...</i>

32
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:56,535
<i>just a little bit each is fine...</i>
<i>share your Genki with me, please...</i>

33
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:52,835
You guys don't know how strong Son-<i>kun</i> is!

34
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,005
From the time he was little,

35
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:58,845
he endured rigorous
training under the Turtle Hermit!

36
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:02,225
He also won the Tenkaichi
Tournament, and such.

37
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:31,835
He takes care of the bad
guys in the blink of an eye!

38
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:47,975
Get it?!

39
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:53,775
If Son-<i>kun</i> goes all-out, that strange
alien would be finished with one blow!

40
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:57,485
You're friends with that alien, aren't you?

41
00:07:03,865 --> 00:07:07,955
If you are friends, then it's in
that alien's best interest for you

42
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:10,125
to stop him before Son-<i>kun</i> gets too serious!

43
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:12,625
How about you go persuade him?

44
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:17,175
Make that clear to him! Make it clear!

45
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:50,375
I-It's huge! Man, is that huge!

46
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:56,175
Is it really all that huge?

47
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:59,675
The one on Earth was about this big.

48
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:03,845
This one's about fifty meters in diameter!

49
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:06,805
No matter what he's done,
he couldn't have made

50
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,475
that large a <i>Genki Dama</i> with
just the energy of this planet.

51
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:13,815
Goku must be gathering <i>ki</i>
from planets all over the place!

52
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:17,485
Freeza still doesn't seem to have realized it.

53
00:08:17,525 --> 00:08:20,865
Why doesn't he attack
with that ball right now?

54
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,155
Unless he gathers more
<i>ki</i> and makes it even bigger,

55
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:24,995
he won't be able to defeat Freeza.

56
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:27,825
That must be what Goku's thinking.

57
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:31,875
F-Father, hurry! Hurry!

58
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:35,745
<i>Planets of the universe, lend me your Genki!</i>

59
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:55,935
What's wrong?

60
00:08:55,975 --> 00:09:01,065
You're planning to do
something, aren't you? So do it!

61
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:06,075
That is unless, are you supposed to
be raising your hands in surrender?

62
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:09,115
<i>All the time it takes to gather the ki required</i>

63
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:11,115
<i>is this technique's greatest weak spot!</i>

64
00:09:11,155 --> 00:09:14,165
<i>Don't let him find out about</i>
<i>this for a little while more, please!</i>

65
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:41,485
ReaCoom!

66
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:47,825
Butta!

67
00:09:50,155 --> 00:09:51,495
Jheese!

68
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:54,495
Ghurd!

69
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,465
Together we are...

70
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:04,175
The Ginyu Special Corps!

71
00:10:08,845 --> 00:10:10,805
That's it! That's it!

72
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,475
Yeah, no matter how many times we do it,

73
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:15,515
our Special Fighting Pose is terrific!

74
00:10:17,855 --> 00:10:21,145
It's a small planet, but still
quite a nice place, isn't it?

75
00:10:21,185 --> 00:10:24,815
How about we make this our
secret hideout for the time being?

76
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,985
That's a good idea.

77
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:32,155
We, the Ginyu Special Corps,
will control the Next World as well!

78
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:35,875
These jerks are warped!

79
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,995
These are the guys that were able to
toss even Vegeta around like child's play,

80
00:10:39,035 --> 00:10:41,835
the Ginyu Special Corps!

81
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,215
Vegeta?!

82
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:50,175
Are you folks colleagues
of Vegeta-<i>chan</i>, then?

83
00:10:50,215 --> 00:10:52,015
Then this won't take long.

84
00:10:52,055 --> 00:10:55,805
We are the Ginyu Special Corps,
who collect nebula for ourselves.

85
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:57,805
We're not at all like Vegeta!

86
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:00,475
That's right! If my luck hadn't turned on me,

87
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:03,815
I would have taken that
monkey scum out with one shot!

88
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:09,525
Well, we don't need to dwell on the past.

89
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:12,325
In any case, we've come to like this planet.

90
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:15,495
You're going to let us stay here.

91
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:18,495
You guys are an annoyance!
You'll have to leave!

92
00:11:18,535 --> 00:11:20,165
Don't you ask such a selfish thing!

93
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:21,915
You guys get out of here!

94
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:24,375
Yeah, yeah!

95
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:30,505
These young men here
want to have a go at us!

96
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:36,185
Interesting! And just as we're here
wanting to get rowdy on someone!

97
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:39,105
Whoa, before we do,

98
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,935
hasn't the Commander always
said that once we get to a new planet,

99
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,445
we should try out our techniques first?

100
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:49,115
Because the effectiveness of some
techniques depends on the place?

101
00:11:49,155 --> 00:11:52,985
That's right! Okay then...

102
00:12:32,065 --> 00:12:35,365
Dammit! How dare you
destroy someone else's things!

103
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:39,405
So, now it's my turn.

104
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:06,395
Nicely done!

105
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:09,435
Ghurd's telekinesis is as good as ever!

106
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,445
Well then, last comes me!

107
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:20,075
<i>ReaCoom Eraser Gun</i>!!

108
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:41,095
<i>That he should have that kind of force</i>
<i>on this planet, with its ten-fold gravity...!</i>

109
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:45,805
Looks as though we can use all
our techniques on this planet too!

110
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,735
What's all this commotion?!

111
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:54,775
Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

112
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:59,445
I will not admit those of
you who disrupt this planet!

113
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:02,785
I will have you leave immediately.

114
00:14:02,825 --> 00:14:06,795
Huh? Some strange old man has come out!

115
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:10,415
Old man, does this mean you
want to play around with us?

116
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:16,465
You guys wouldn't be
able to lay one hand on me.

117
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:20,475
You seem to enjoy your jokes.

118
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:23,765
Why don't you test me
to see if I'm joking or not?

119
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:26,145
Okay, then!

120
00:14:29,395 --> 00:14:32,395
<i>Goku's Genki Dama...!</i>

121
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:52,045
Cut it out already!

122
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:55,045
How long do you intend
to just stand there like that?

123
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:58,425
Good question. How long indeed?

124
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:05,765
Damn you!!

125
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:18,065
H-He's found out!

126
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:21,075
No! Not yet!

127
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:31,205
So, what's the matter?

128
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:33,755
You were going to attack me somehow, right?

129
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:45,925
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

130
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:19,465
<i>A little more...</i>

131
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:24,425
So, what are you going to do?

132
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,075
G-Goku!

133
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:46,745
Father!

134
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:53,085
Gohan, Kuririn, give over
what remaining <i>ki</i> you have to me!

135
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,085
Give it to me, now!

136
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,085
Right!

137
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:24,195
Hey, don't be in such a rush!

138
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:27,905
Don't toy with me, you monkey scum!

139
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,385
Don't think about anything else!

140
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:47,715
Concentrate your <i>ki</i>!

141
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:49,095
Right!

142
00:18:07,115 --> 00:18:10,865
I don't know what you Saiyans are thinking.

143
00:18:10,905 --> 00:18:14,875
It's the same as it was back then.

144
00:18:14,915 --> 00:18:17,085
You're a most unpleasant group.

145
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:23,715
I have no intention of continuing
this uninteresting battle any further.

146
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:28,095
I'm going to finish both
you and this planet off at once.

147
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:32,725
Just another runt will have died,

148
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:38,105
and the Saiyans will be completely
eliminated from this world!

149
00:18:39,105 --> 00:18:44,445
The Super Saiyan was nothing
more than a bedtime story after all.

150
00:18:51,115 --> 00:18:54,955
That's not the sun! What is it?!

151
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:05,425
He found it!

152
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:08,085
W-What is that?!

153
00:19:11,135 --> 00:19:15,135
It couldn't be... a mass of energy?

154
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:19,145
<i>Y-You did that?!</i>

155
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,065
All right, that's enough.

156
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:29,065
Save a little <i>ki</i> for yourselves.

157
00:19:30,115 --> 00:19:32,405
Looks as if he's finally found it out.

158
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:35,955
Gohan, Kuririn, you two stay here!

159
00:19:35,995 --> 00:19:38,745
No matter what happens, stay back!

160
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:42,755
H-He's been forming that up in the sky?!

161
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:46,085
Where did he find that
much remaining power?!

162
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:50,425
<i>It's no use! Even if I use the</i>
<i>Genki Dama now, he will avoid it!</i>

163
00:19:50,465 --> 00:19:55,425
<i>Besides which, that ball still ain't</i>
<i>enough to defeat Freeza, dammit!</i>

164
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:59,765
You were planning to
take me by surprise with that?

165
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,765
You're so pathetic!

166
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:06,775
However, even this desperate
measure has become worthless!

167
00:20:15,405 --> 00:20:17,075
Too bad!

168
00:20:21,415 --> 00:20:22,745
Damn!

169
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:29,085
Be gone!

170
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:43,065
Piccolo!

171
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:47,355
Goku, hurry up and complete
this "<i>Genki Dama</i>" of yours!

172
00:20:47,395 --> 00:20:49,065
I owe you one!

173
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:01,875
Make it fast, Goku!

174
00:21:01,915 --> 00:21:05,085
With the power I have, it was all
I could do just to blindside him!

175
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,415
Gotcha!

176
00:21:20,135 --> 00:21:25,435
Are you still lurking about,
you miserable Namekian?!

177
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:43,575
So, let's stop the chatter
and blow all these guys away!

178
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:52,755
Ah, wait! I'm leaving this up to you guys!

179
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:55,135
Y-You wouldn't!

180
00:22:10,815 --> 00:22:14,445
Our opponents are awfully tough!

181
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:16,065
Ten-<i>san</i>!

182
00:22:18,825 --> 00:22:22,115
<i>Piccolo accomplishes a flawless support strike.</i>

183
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:29,085
<i>Goku, now is the time! Make</i>
<i>that super-giant Genki Dama full!</i>

184
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:48,815
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

185
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:54,655
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

186
00:22:54,695 --> 00:22:57,025
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

187
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:05,495
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

188
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:12,005
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

189
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:16,135
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

190
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:19,635
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

191
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:22,255
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

192
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:29,765
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

193
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:33,855
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

194
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:35,695
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

195
00:23:35,735 --> 00:23:39,695
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

196
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:45,365
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

197
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:47,535
<i>So sorry.</i>

198
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:52,665
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

199
00:23:55,415 --> 00:24:00,675
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

200
00:24:12,355 --> 00:24:14,315
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

201
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:17,105
<i>Everyone in the universe,</i>
<i>thank you for giving me your power.</i>

202
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:21,615
<i>Hurry it up, Goku! That Freeza</i>
<i>bastard is really angry now!</i>

203
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:26,115
<i>Take this, Freeza!</i>

204
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:27,865
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

205
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:31,495
<i>"The Incredible Destructive Force of</i>
<i>the Genki Dama!! Who Will Survive!?"</i>

206
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:35,205
<i>Father! Piccolo-san!</i>

207
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:38,335
"Next time"
"The Incredible Destructive Force of
the Genki Dama!! Who Will Survive!?"
