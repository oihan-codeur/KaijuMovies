<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:24,670
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,930
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,690
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,230
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:52,120
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,620
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:04,630
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,090
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:14,220
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,600
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:26,570
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,110
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,950
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:58,100
Fifty percent power, he says...

17
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,100
Whether those words are
a bluff, or whether they ain't,

18
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,150
all I can do is stake everything
on a times twenty <i>Kaio-ken</i>!

19
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,950
<i>Ka... me...</i>

20
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,620
<i>ha... me...</i>

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,130
<i>HA</i>!!

22
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,630
<i>Goku has risked it all on a</i>
<i>twenty-fold Kaio-ken! And yet...</i>

23
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,860
<i>"A Super-Huge Genki Dama–</i>
<i>I'm Playing My Last Card!!"</i>

24
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,740
It's no good.

25
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,950
Not even with Goku's times twenty <i>Kaio-ken.</i>

26
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,750
How can it be?

27
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,460
That didn't have much effect on him at all!

28
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,760
He wasn't bluffing this time either!

29
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,140
H-He really hasn't been using
any more than half of his power!

30
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,770
Ow, ow ow! Where am I?

31
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,060
Let's see...

32
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:14,110
I was a frog, and the frog
was me, and Kuririn was there...

33
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,120
Um, and Son-<i>kun</i> might have been there...

34
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,750
Enough! What's taking Son-<i>kun</i> so long?

35
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,460
Just take care of those aliens, already!

36
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,120
This planet really is the worst!

37
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,260
I've found you! This is your fault!

38
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,140
You won't get away with it!

39
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:07,120
Unbelievable! Goku's <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>
just now had incredible power!

40
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,790
Y-Yeah...

41
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,130
Why, then?

42
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,800
Why is it that Freeza has
barely taken any damage, then?

43
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,800
Father's <i>ki</i> has dropped considerably!

44
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,800
To think that a guy like
that could exist in this world!

45
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,800
It's utterly lost.

46
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,270
It's just as Kaio said.

47
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,440
No matter what, we should
have kept our hands off of Freeza.

48
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,120
<i>T-That was a close one!</i>

49
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,790
<i>How?!</i>

50
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,790
<i>How does that lower life form</i>
<i>Saiyan have such awesome power?</i>

51
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,470
<i>This is the first time anyone has</i>
<i>done this much harm to my body!</i>

52
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,430
You damn Saiyan!

53
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,120
That one...

54
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,790
...hurt.

55
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,460
It hurt!!

56
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,430
Father!

57
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,460
Monkey!

58
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,170
What happened to all that
energy you had a moment ago?

59
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,160
K-Kaio-<i>sama</i>, what is happening?

60
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,790
He's being beaten! Goku is
taking a one-sided beating!

61
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,450
H-He's what?!

62
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,540
H-He can't be!

63
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,210
F-Freeza is frighteningly strong.

64
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,920
That twenty-power <i>Kaio-ken</i>
was beyond Goku's limits after all.

65
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,060
What's wrong?

66
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,480
Have you finally used
up the last of your power?

67
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,060
How dull.

68
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:07,110
And here I thought I'd found an opponent
I could get somewhat serious over.

69
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:15,250
<i>I really have lost a great deal of power.</i>

70
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,830
<i>Looks as though that times twenty</i>
<i>Kaio-ken had its price, all right.</i>

71
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:26,510
Indeed, the Saiyans are a lower life form,
whose only talent is in fighting.

72
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,090
Every last one of you are fools.

73
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:33,720
Killing you off was the right decision.

74
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,060
<i>It's... all over...</i>

75
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,400
<i>Kakarrot, you disappoint me!</i>

76
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,940
<i>Is that the extent of your power?</i>

77
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,070
<i>Where has your Saiyan pride gone?</i>

78
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,070
I ain't no Saiyan!

79
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,740
<i>Are you still saying that?!</i>
<i>You're a Saiyan unlike any other!</i>

80
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:00,460
Vegeta, none of that matters now.
Team up with me...

81
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,760
You are a Saiyan!

82
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,100
You have the fighting Saiyan
people's blood flowing through you!

83
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,110
Do you not feel the anguish?

84
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,440
The man who destroyed Planet Vegeta,

85
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,780
the world where you and
I were both born, is this same Freeza!

86
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,120
Does it not wound your pride as a
Saiyan to be battered about by him?!

87
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,460
Saiyan... pride?

88
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:49,130
Your father, Burdock...

89
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,800
As well as my father, King Vegeta...

90
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,480
Kakarrot, you are the last remaining Saiyan!

91
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,160
He wants to kill every last Saiyan.

92
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,490
This is because he fears the birth

93
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,830
of what is said to be the
strongest warrior in the universe,

94
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,170
the legendary Super Saiyan!

95
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,840
If I could have, I would have
killed him by my own hand.

96
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,180
And then I get killed like a rag doll!

97
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,730
If you understand my anguish,

98
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,770
then be sure to kill him by your hand!

99
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:03,330
I... don't understand
what it is you're thinking.

100
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:08,290
I hate that sort of thing!

101
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,890
But I won't let you die easily.

102
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:24,430
I still want to have some fun, you see.

103
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,570
Vegeta, I was raised on Earth,

104
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,070
so I don't know
anything about being Saiyan.

105
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,910
But I can at least understand your grief!

106
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,080
You're talking nonsense again.

107
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,580
I must not lose.

108
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,250
I must not lose, not to the likes of Freeza!

109
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,960
Stop messing with me!

110
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,230
What?!

111
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,910
Don't fool...

112
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,530
...with me!

113
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,580
Why, you!

114
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,510
That was kind of close just now!

115
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,300
Looks like you've got
a bit of fight back in you.

116
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,020
But you Saiyans are still lower life forms.

117
00:13:56,150 --> 00:14:00,110
I can read what you're
going to do next as you attack.

118
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,910
You will forever be unable to beat me!

119
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:34,060
F-Father!

120
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,560
Looks like this is it.

121
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,570
You'll be wanting to die pretty soon, right?

122
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,740
I'll put you out of your misery right now!

123
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,720
What's that? What's the matter?

124
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,220
It's Bubbles-<i>kun</i>!

125
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,260
It sounds like it came from the house!

126
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,740
What's the matter, Bubbles?

127
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,280
Gregory!

128
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,910
It looks like there's someone in there!

129
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,080
–Ah, yum! Yum!
–Look at all this food!

130
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,630
Yummy, yummy!

131
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,300
Who are you guys?!

132
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,310
ReaCoom!

133
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,230
Butta!

134
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,400
Jheese!

135
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,400
Ghurd!

136
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,400
Together we are...

137
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,910
The Ginyu Special Corps!

138
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,960
It's missing something, huh?

139
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,090
Maybe because the Commander isn't here.

140
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:03,090
We haven't done this in a while, either.

141
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,090
No, it has to be the gravity!

142
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:08,430
Okay, let's try it again!

143
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,760
Together we are...

144
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,260
The Ginyu Special Corps!

145
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,020
All right! That one went well!

146
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,690
We nailed it!

147
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,690
Okay, from now on, that's how we'll do it.

148
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:29,740
W-What's the deal... with these guys?

149
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,710
I can't take it any more! I'm going!

150
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,250
W-Wait!

151
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,010
How come? Father will be killed!

152
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,600
Goku is about to do something!

153
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,730
But what?

154
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,930
What can he hope to do with
such little remaining power?

155
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,400
What's this? What are you trying to do?

156
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,880
Ah! A <i>Genki Dama</i>!

157
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,380
What? A <i>Genki Dama</i>?

158
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,720
T-That's right. The <i>Genki Dama,</i>

159
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,260
a last-ditch technique
he learned from Kaio-<i>sama.</i>

160
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,390
The foliage and animals on this planet,

161
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:41,060
as well as ourselves,
and even microorganisms...

162
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,560
He takes a fraction of the
<i>Genki</i>, the basic energy of life,

163
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,270
from every living thing,
and apportions it to himself.

164
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:51,280
And then... and then he creates a
ball of energy, and attacks with it!

165
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,950
What?!

166
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:56,870
Damn, Kaio.

167
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,410
You kept that back from us, didn't you?

168
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:03,080
B-But will it work against Freeza?

169
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,090
There's a far smaller number of
living things on this planet than on Earth!

170
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:13,090
What choice is there?!
Goku has to realize that too!

171
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,100
Are you saying there's another option left?!

172
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,970
All we can do is gamble that this works!

173
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:56,300
<i>I can't beat Freeza with just</i>
<i>the energy from this planet.</i>

174
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,600
<i>Those planets in the vicinity of Namek,</i>

175
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,850
<i>I only need a little from each of you...</i>

176
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,180
<i>Share some of your Genki with me!</i>

177
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:51,320
<i>T-This Genki Dama is the</i>
<i>last thing I wanted to use.</i>

178
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,690
<i>There'll probably be too much force to it!</i>

179
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,240
<i>It will be hard not to squash the planet itself!</i>

180
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:04,200
<i>But if I don't wipe out Freeza here and now,</i>

181
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,040
<i>the universe itself could be torn apart!</i>

182
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,550
<i>I don't know if this is</i>
<i>going to go right or not,</i>

183
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:15,720
<i>but it's all I can do now!</i>

184
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,380
What's this you're doing?

185
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:23,930
You're still thinking of trying
some kind of nonsense, are you?

186
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,940
What can you possibly do,
as worn out as you are?

187
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,070
G-Goku...

188
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,240
Can you really beat
Freeza with a <i>Genki Dama</i>?

189
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,620
W-What's this I'm sensing?

190
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,250
I-It's...

191
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,590
<i>G-Genki Dama...</i>

192
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:07,310
I-It can't be! It's so huge!

193
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,740
<i>A Genki Dama, loaded</i>
<i>with the hopes of the universe.</i>

194
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:26,240
<i>Will this turn out to be Goku's very last card?</i>

195
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,560
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

196
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,400
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

197
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,770
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

198
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,240
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

199
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,750
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

200
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,880
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

201
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,380
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

202
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,010
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

203
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,510
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

204
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,600
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

205
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,440
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

206
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,440
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

207
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,110
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

208
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,280
<i>So sorry.</i>

209
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,410
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

210
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,420
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

211
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,060
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

212
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,730
<i>The time it takes to gather the ki required</i>

213
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,610
<i>is the Genki Dama's greatest weak spot!</i>

214
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,070
<i>Don't let him find out about</i>
<i>this for a little while more, please!</i>

215
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,780
<i>Gohan, Kuririn, give over</i>
<i>what remaining ki you have to me!</i>

216
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,450
<i>I have an idea!</i>

217
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,280
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

218
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,580
<i>"Keep the Chance Alive!!</i>
<i>Piccolo's Suicide Support Strike."</i>

219
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,500
<i>Everyone who lives in the universe,</i>

220
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
<i>share your Genki energy with Father!</i>

221
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,290
"Next time"
"Keep the Chance Alive!!
Piccolo's Suicide Support Strike"
