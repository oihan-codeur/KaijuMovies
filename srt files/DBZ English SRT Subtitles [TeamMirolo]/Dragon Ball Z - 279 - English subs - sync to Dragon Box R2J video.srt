<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:30,305
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,065
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:41,695
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,955
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:54,705
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,295
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,335 --> 00:01:00,215
<i>The sky is clear</i>

00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:03,045
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,635
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:08,635
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,645
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,655
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,655
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:30,995
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:34,205
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,045
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,835
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:46,135
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:59,645
<i>Majin Boo, while searching</i>
<i>for Goku and the others,</i>

24
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:02,105
<i>who had escaped to the holy</i>
<i>region of the Kaioshin Realm,</i>

25
00:02:02,145 --> 00:02:05,355
<i>was wandering through space, and</i>
<i>finally arrived at the Grand Kaio's world.</i>

26
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:09,655
Boo is planning to destroy
the Grand Kaio's world too!

27
00:02:13,825 --> 00:02:15,785
We're the ones he's after!

28
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:19,795
We'll raise our <i>ki</i> and let
him know that we are here!

29
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:23,175
Th-That's it! All right!

30
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:25,675
You've had it!

31
00:02:26,835 --> 00:02:31,345
<i>At length, Majin Boo appeared in</i>
<i>the holy region of the Kaioshin Realm!</i>

32
00:02:31,385 --> 00:02:35,185
<i>A battle with the entire</i>
<i>universe on the line now begins!</i>

33
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:43,235
<i>"Seize the Future!!</i>
<i>A Decisive Battle with the Universe at Stake."</i>

34
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,975
Hmph. On this planet,
we can fight as hard as we want!

35
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:27,145
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, please, I want you to take
everyone and move to some other planet.

36
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,695
It appears that this ain't going to
be finished with half-hearted fighting.

37
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:33,695
I don't want to be any trouble to anyone else.

38
00:03:33,735 --> 00:03:35,615
R-Right, understood!

39
00:03:35,655 --> 00:03:38,035
What are we going to do with you?! Okay, fine.

40
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:42,705
This Kaioshin Realm won't be destroyed
over anything reasonable, after all.

41
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,715
Goku, Vegeta, you fight him as hard as you can!

42
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:47,415
Thank you, old timer.

43
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:51,965
Good luck, Goku-<i>san</i>, Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

44
00:03:56,425 --> 00:04:01,055
Now then, are you ready?
Please touch part of my body.

45
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:03,605
–Like this?
–Okay, here we go!

46
00:04:20,705 --> 00:04:23,955
–Where are we?
–One of the planets in the Lower Realm.

47
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:28,675
Here, even if the Kaioshin Realm is
destroyed, we should not be affected.

48
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:32,805
Sure is overrun by grass. Well, I guess
it's better than having nothing but rocks.

49
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:34,805
Let's see...

50
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,475
Those Saiyans sure are troublesome.

51
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:40,765
They tossed away those precious
Potara, and judging from their manner,

52
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:45,025
they don't appear to be of any
mind to merge with Fusion, either.

53
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:48,025
W-Will they be able to win
against Majin Boo like that?

54
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:55,035
Well, if the two of them
put their powers together...

55
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,445
All right! How about we try smacking him one,

56
00:04:57,485 --> 00:04:59,455
to see if we can do anything about this?

57
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:00,705
Yeah.

58
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:06,125
Who's going to go first?

59
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:09,125
All right...

60
00:05:09,165 --> 00:05:11,675
–Let's decide!
–All right!

61
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:19,225
Rock, Scissors, Paper! Tie, go again!

62
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:21,685
Again! Again! Again!

63
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,555
I did it! I won!

64
00:05:26,515 --> 00:05:28,525
They're planning to fight one at a time!

65
00:05:28,565 --> 00:05:33,025
I-Imbeciles! Can't you fight together?!
Your opponent is Majin Boo!

66
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:38,655
Kakarrot! I'm going to have a
good hard look at the way you fight!

67
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:43,115
Okay! Your turn might just disappear, though!

68
00:05:44,705 --> 00:05:46,665
I can say this now, but the truth is,

69
00:05:46,705 --> 00:05:52,425
I could have beaten that chubby
Boo back when I was at Super Saiyan 3.

70
00:05:52,465 --> 00:05:56,595
But I wanted those young guys
to do something about him instead.

71
00:05:56,635 --> 00:05:59,385
For the sake of what would
happen on Earth afterward.

72
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,935
Vegeta, that jerk, he's not listening!

73
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,595
Here goes, Boo!

74
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:13,235
He's being considerably tranquil this time.

75
00:06:24,575 --> 00:06:26,575
He's sleeping!

76
00:06:37,755 --> 00:06:43,885
Damn it, because of that despicable guy,
both the Earth and my friends were wiped out.

77
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,805
I won't let him get away with it!

78
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:17,675
H-He's a strange one.

79
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:19,175
Now I've done it!

80
00:07:19,215 --> 00:07:24,095
I forgot to bring that human
named Satan from the Kaioshin Realm!

81
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:26,225
Doesn't matter. Leave him be.

82
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:53,165
What's this? What's going on?

83
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:59,675
Oh, it's you, is it?

84
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:12,555
You know what?
Where did everyone else go?

85
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:28,075
I-It's him! And Goku, too!

86
00:08:28,115 --> 00:08:30,665
Where in the world are they?

87
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,665
It's the Kaioshin Realm.

88
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,255
The holy region of the Kaioshin Realm,

89
00:08:35,295 --> 00:08:37,665
where even us Kaio find it difficult to go.

90
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:40,755
Now Boo has moved there, instantaneously.

91
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:45,095
The reason he went there
without destroying this planet first...

92
00:08:45,135 --> 00:08:49,015
...was because he wanted to find
Goku and them as soon as he could!

93
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:54,015
Is that it? So thanks to Goku
and the others, we were spared.

94
00:08:54,055 --> 00:08:56,685
Kaio of the North,
what are you babbling about?

95
00:08:56,725 --> 00:08:59,395
What in the world is the matter?

96
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:03,195
You too can spy on things far away, right?

97
00:09:03,235 --> 00:09:05,695
If you look, you'll soon understand.

98
00:09:05,735 --> 00:09:07,075
Let's see...

99
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:09,995
The holy region of the Kaioshin Realm.

100
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,785
It's the guy from before!

101
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:30,175
Impudent bastard!

102
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:39,105
You bastard... Do you even feel like going at it?

103
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:39,085
He's won, he's won!
Our blond big brother has won!

104
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:52,515
Did he get him?

105
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:55,475
Awesome, Goku! That was
right off the bat, you know!

106
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:58,315
All right...!

107
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,975
Has Goku-<i>san</i> won?

108
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:04,775
No. It will take more than
just that for Boo to be defeated.

109
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:19,415
Sure enough...

110
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,635
That bastard!

111
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:36,865
I-Is this dream still going on?!
This is one powerful dream!

112
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:38,635
Damn! Hang in there, blond big brother!

113
00:13:38,675 --> 00:13:42,595
Don't you lose! It's a dream,
but you must not lose!

114
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:53,965
I'm astounded... I'm astounded! What a fight!

115
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:56,715
O-One of them is that Son Goku fellow,

116
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:59,425
who came here quite
a while ago to train, right?

117
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:04,385
Right. The same one who competed for victory
against Paikuhan in the Anoyoichi Tournament.

118
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:07,555
Since then, he's become
far and away the strongest.

119
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:08,725
And the other one?

120
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:13,485
That's Majin Boo.
You've heard about him, right?

121
00:15:13,525 --> 00:15:15,945
Long ago, he ran roughshod over the universe,

122
00:15:15,985 --> 00:15:20,075
and gave four of the
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> such a hard time.

123
00:15:20,115 --> 00:15:25,075
That's Majin Boo, the one
who Madoshi Bibidi created?

124
00:15:25,115 --> 00:15:30,085
The legendary essence of evil,
most wicked in all of history?

125
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,835
That's the guy who earlier
came and attacked here?

126
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,005
Paikuhan, thank goodness you weren't killed!

127
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:54,895
You bastard... Mess with me, will you?

128
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:34,355
I-Is this the power those two have?!
This is a whole different league!

129
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:39,605
Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, what are you doing?

130
00:17:22,565 --> 00:17:26,905
What is he thinking? Ain't no way
I'm just going to silently look on!

131
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:35,585
What?

132
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,775
What is this?! What's wrong?!

133
00:18:47,815 --> 00:18:50,325
Is this the end of the
world and the Other World?!

134
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:20,585
I-It's all over!

135
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,755
Not even Goku-<i>san</i> is a match for him!

136
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:28,045
Boo will wreak havoc on the entire universe!

137
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:31,425
Look, don't worry.

138
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:35,595
It looks a little like Goku
is considering something.

139
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:41,765
He's measuring Boo's power.
That's the sort of fighting he was doing.

140
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,735
It's the end of this world!
It's the end of the Other World!

141
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:48,855
It's the end of Mister Satan!

142
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:02,915
Majin Boo, you are one dense guy,

143
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:06,415
but your power, speed, and
powers of recovery are all incredible!

144
00:21:06,455 --> 00:21:08,625
You're on a whole different
level from all the Boos up to now!

145
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:10,625
You're ridiculously strong!

146
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:35,065
There, look! Goku is finally getting serious!

147
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:04,345
Hmph, so Kakarrot has
finally decided to get down to it?

148
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:11,185
So then, the fight starts now!

149
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:19,655
<i>Finally, Goku becomes Super Saiyan 3.</i>

150
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:24,575
<i>The climax of the fight, with the</i>
<i>entire universe at stake, is about to begin!</i>

151
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:38,795
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

152
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:45,385
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

153
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:55,945
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

154
00:22:55,985 --> 00:23:02,035
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

155
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:09,045
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

156
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:14,415
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

157
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:18,295
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

158
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:27,395
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

159
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,895
<i>Even now?</i>

160
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:36,565
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

161
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:41,945
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

162
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:48,415
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

163
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:58,465
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

164
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,525
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

165
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:16,855
<i>You're strong all right, Boo.</i>

166
00:24:16,895 --> 00:24:19,445
<i>Even fighting you at full</i>
<i>strength, you'd do me in.</i>

167
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:22,695
<i>Kakarrot, in the end,</i>
<i>I was unable to surpass you.</i>

168
00:24:22,735 --> 00:24:25,575
<i>You're the only one who</i>
<i>can fight with Majin Boo!</i>

169
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:27,785
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

170
00:24:27,825 --> 00:24:32,205
<i>"Vegeta Takes Off His Hat!!</i>
<i>Goku, You Are No. 1."</i>

171
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:35,835
<i>You can't lose, Father!</i>
<i>For Vegeta-san's sake, as well!</i>

172
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:39,585
"Next time"
"Vegeta Takes Off His Hat!!
Goku, You Are No. 1"
