16
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:57,025

Try saying something
in Namekian. Tell it to fly.

21
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:13,945
Anywhere is fine!

22
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:16,285
I know, how about around Jupiter for now?

23
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:31,095
It's Jupiter! That's incredible!

24
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:36,065
This is an incredible spaceship! Not
even Planet Namek is too far away like this!

Wow, this truly is amazing.
The universe really is a big place.

27
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:02,125
To think that there's a genius
even greater than myself out there...

28
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:06,965
This is no time to be admiring it, Dad.
Check it out as fast as possible, okay?

29
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,565
Okay, okay.

30
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:14,105
So anyway, this is an incredible spaceship.
It took us to Jupiter, just like that!

31
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:17,505
Really, it was amazing!

32
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:20,505
Huh? Sweet olives?
What's wrong with your nose?

33
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:23,385
No! Jupiter! Jupiter!

34
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:29,145
Anyhow, once we finish up here,
we're taking off, so get everyone together!

35
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:31,125
I'm counting on you!

36
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:45,135
Nah, it's nothin'.

37
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:55,005
Here.

00:03:55,045 --> 00:03:56,845
I've had enough.

39
00:03:56,885 --> 00:04:01,515
No you haven't! You've got to eat,
and recover from your injuries, quick.

40
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,085
Okay.

41
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,525
We've done it, Goku!

42
00:04:10,565 --> 00:04:14,965
Cheer up! Word is, we've found a
spaceship! We can go to Planet Namek!

43
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,965
Piccolo and Tenshinhan and the
others will be coming back to life for sure!

44
00:04:18,005 --> 00:04:20,305
Is that right?

45
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:22,245
Good work.

46
00:04:53,475 --> 00:04:56,465
I splurged, and bought this many! See?

47
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,275
G-Gohan<i>-chan</i>?

48
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:11,555
Where did he go?!

49
00:05:11,595 --> 00:05:12,955
What's wrong?

50
00:05:12,995 --> 00:05:15,555
Gohan<i>-chan</i> isn't here.

51
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:19,525
Huh? He was there reading
his book just a little while ago.

52
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:23,095
He shouldn't even be
able to walk properly yet...

53
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,665
What if he breaks a bone?!

54
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,105
She's making too much of it.

55
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:43,055
35...

56
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:46,055
36...

57
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:49,055
37...

58
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,125
38...

59
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:01,265
That was close, that was close...

60
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:04,275
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

61
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,245
Where could Gohan<i>-chan</i> have gone?

62
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,685
His legs haven't healed,
so he couldn't be up walkin'...

63
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,125
All righty...

64
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:39,535
That should be okay.

65
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:44,245
Gohan<i>-chan</i>! Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

66
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:51,215
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

67
00:06:51,255 --> 00:06:54,025
What are you doin' in a place like this?!

68
00:06:54,065 --> 00:07:00,125
Mother... It was such a nice day,
I thought I would read my book outside.

69
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:02,505
Don't be so rash!

70
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,795
Come on, I'll carry you back to the room.

71
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:08,935
I-I'm completely okay now...

72
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:14,275
That carelessness of yours
is dangerous. Come on, get on.

73
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:22,575
Good grief, you're so
reckless. Who are you takin' after?

74
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:26,525
What that all means is, the
spaceship is absolutely okay!

75
00:07:26,565 --> 00:07:31,095
In that spaceship, you'll be able to
get to Planet Namek in just one month!

76
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:34,095
All that's left is to
remodel the interior a little.

77
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:37,935
I'd say you can leave in five days.

78
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:39,335
That's right.

79
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,105
To Planet Namek in Kami<i>-sama</i>'s
spaceship, huh? Amazing!

80
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:46,335
That glimmer of light
looks like it's becoming reality.

81
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:51,245
And so, Popo<i>-san</i>, it's all up to
you to go to Planet Namek for us.

82
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,045
Mister Popo not going.

83
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:59,955
Mister Popo can't go. Be away from
Kami<i>-sama</i>'s palace two months. Can't.

84
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:04,955
Oh, no! But you're the only one
who knows how to speak Namekian!

85
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:08,525
You also seem pretty tough.
Popo<i>-san</i>, you have to be the one who goes!

86
00:08:08,565 --> 00:08:11,235
No worry. Teach you Namekian.

87
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:17,305
Well, Bulma<i>-san</i>, you'll have to go.

88
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:22,105
If anything were to happen, you're the only
one familiar with the mechanics, Bulma<i>-san.</i>

89
00:08:22,145 --> 00:08:26,415
Fine, then. It doesn't sound all that dangerous.

90
00:08:26,455 --> 00:08:28,545
I'll have to build in a shower room, too...

91
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:32,955
...and a more comfortable bed, and a stereo...

92
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:36,955
But there's no way I'm going by
myself, okay? Someone come with me!

93
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:40,125
I'm tellin' ya right now,
there ain't no way I'm goin'.

94
00:08:40,165 --> 00:08:43,135
Nobody was expecting you to.

95
00:08:43,175 --> 00:08:45,135
Ahem...

96
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:50,835
Two months round trip, huh? All right,
I guess I've got no choice but to go with you.

97
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:53,445
That will just add unnecessary danger!

98
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:55,005
I knew it.

99
00:08:55,045 --> 00:09:00,945
Son<i>-kun</i> is in this state and all...
Kuririn, you'll come with me, right?

100
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:08,125
M-Me? That's okay and all, but
for two months? I wanted to train...

101
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:11,525
You never know when that
Saiyan will be coming again.

102
00:09:11,565 --> 00:09:14,525
Nice for you. I wanted to go, too.

103
00:09:14,565 --> 00:09:18,535
I wanted to see what kind of Shen
Long would appear on Planet Namek.

104
00:09:18,575 --> 00:09:20,965
Well, Goku, you stay here and rest up,

105
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:23,135
and come up with a strategy
against the Saiyan, or something.

106
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:26,135
Yeah, right. We'll be
counting on the both of you.

107
00:09:26,175 --> 00:09:28,515
U-Um...

108
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,505
What's the matter? Have to go potty?

109
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:46,055
P-Please take me, too!

110
00:09:51,905 --> 00:09:56,875
G-Gohan<i>-chan</i>! W-What kind of silly joke is that?

111
00:09:56,915 --> 00:10:02,045
It's not a joke! I-I really want to go...

112
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:06,475
D-Don't be absurd! It'll take two
more months, on top of everythin' else!

113
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:09,885
I'm sorry. I want to go, no matter what.

114
00:10:09,925 --> 00:10:14,425
I want to be the one who
brings Piccolo<i>-san</i> back to life myself.

115
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:17,525
So that's it. Well said, Gohan.

116
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:21,025
What kind of nonsense are you two talkin'?!

117
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:24,435
There's no reason for
Gohan<i>-chan</i> to be doin' any of this!

118
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,435
What if anythin' were to happen?!

119
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:29,875
For cryin' out loud, he
hasn't even healed enough!

120
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:32,875
We'd better stand back.

121
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,875
As far as my body goes, I'm fine.

122
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,445
W-What are you doin'?!

123
00:10:38,485 --> 00:10:41,085
S-Stop that, Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

124
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,455
I beg you, please take me.

125
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:49,385
I won't stand for this!
I absolutely won't stand for this!

126
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:53,595
It's two months! On top of the year
of anxiety I've already been through!

127
00:10:53,635 --> 00:10:55,895
What about cram school?
What about your lessons?!

128
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:58,765
You've already fallen way
behind the other children!

129
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,235
Piccolo's got nothin' to do with anythin'!

130
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:05,275
You are a little child, and
you should act like a child!

131
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:07,505
Shut up!

132
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:16,445
Gohan<i>-chan...</i> you've turned into a delinquent!

133
00:11:16,485 --> 00:11:23,455
M-Mother... right now... right now
really isn't the time to be talking about that.

134
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:26,455
We all fought desperately
to save everyone on Earth,

135
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:28,895
and we have to bring
those who died back to life,

136
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:31,895
to fight against the Saiyan once again!

137
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:35,265
I can... I can fight, too!

138
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:38,835
I have to... I have to do something!

139
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:43,045
Understand, Mother. I'm sorry.

140
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:48,485
That kid says some pretty
awesome things once in a while.

141
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:53,255
He's got you beat, Chichi.

142
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:58,025
Now let Gohan go off into space willingly.

143
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:03,125
<i>Gohan, nice going.</i>
<i>You really have grown stronger.</i>

144
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:06,035
It's okay, I tell you. He'll be completely fine.

145
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:08,065
Let us take care of him.

146
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,705
There won't be anything
dangerous this time around, after all.

147
00:12:14,385 --> 00:12:17,145
Can you learn Namekian in five days?

148
00:12:17,185 --> 00:12:20,015
Right, we'll have to input
it all into a translator device,

149
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:22,515
so... let's see, we'll need ten days.

150
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:25,545
All right, let's meet up ten
days from now at Kame House!

151
00:12:26,765 --> 00:12:28,315
Right!

152
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:57,115
"Good day" is "Pikonatto."

153
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,555
"Pikonatto," huh?

154
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,735
All right, you're fine.

155
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,115
Yow!

156
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:39,595
You don't need to bother...

157
00:13:39,635 --> 00:13:44,765
Oh, no! If you say that,
girls aren't goin' to like you.

158
00:13:48,105 --> 00:13:50,505
Time for your medicine already.

159
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:52,535
Oh, water, water...

160
00:14:13,235 --> 00:14:14,725
Hit me.

161
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:19,935
All right!

162
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:27,145
Don't hold back! Hit me as hard as you can!

163
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:28,645
Right.

164
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:55,305
Good. If you can hit that
hard, you'll be fine, Gohan.

165
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:58,145
You'll do a great job of standing in for me.

166
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:03,675
<i>And so, in the blink of</i>
<i>an eye, ten days went by,</i>

167
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:06,705
<i>and the day of launch had come.</i>

168
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:15,755
Whoo! Can we really get
to Planet Namek in this thing?

169
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:20,165
Well, don't you look sharp, Kuririn?

170
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:23,595
You're not, by any chance,
making light of outer space, are you?

171
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:29,135
I even cut my hair, because it
would be in the way inside my space suit!

172
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:35,175
Well? Isn't Gohan<i>-kun</i> here yet?

173
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:38,175
He'll be coming really soon, from the hospital.

174
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:39,775
He hadn't been discharged yet?

175
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:43,615
No. Chichi<i>-san</i> insisted that
he remain up until the last minute.

176
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:46,615
Good grief, she's so overprotective.

177
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,525
Say, Bulma<i>-san...</i>

178
00:15:48,565 --> 00:15:50,955
Do you think we should take umbrellas?

179
00:15:50,995 --> 00:15:54,865
Planet Namek won't
necessarily have nice weather.

180
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:56,735
Suit yourself.

181
00:15:57,705 --> 00:16:00,105
Oh, looks like they're here.

182
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:25,725
Sorry we're a little late.

183
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:33,135
So this is the spaceship, huh?
It's somethin' else!

184
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:41,905
Okay, Gohan<i>-chan</i>, make
sure you're careful as you go.

185
00:16:49,725 --> 00:16:52,555
What's the matter? Come on out.

186
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:07,135
Make sure you brush your teeth after meals.

187
00:17:09,805 --> 00:17:14,205
Is that really you, Gohan?
What happened to your hair?

188
00:17:14,245 --> 00:17:18,115
F-Father laughed at me, too.

189
00:17:18,155 --> 00:17:21,585
Whatever else you might say, this is
the first time man is goin' to outer space.

190
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:25,155
We don't want to be ill-mannered.

191
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:27,725
Uh, what is all that?

192
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:31,155
This is his change of
underwear and study gear...

193
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:33,765
this is two months' worth
of his medicine and vitamins...

194
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,165
his dryer...

195
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:37,765
his brush... his bowl and chopsticks... also–

196
00:17:37,805 --> 00:17:39,765
T-That's enough.

197
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:45,175
Well, shall we get going right away, then?
For some reason, I'm feeling discouraged.

198
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:49,105
We're depending on you. Make
sure you find the Dragon Balls for us.

199
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,545
Right!

200
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:57,715
"Piccolo."

201
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:22,605
Grandpa, Mother, Turtle Hermit<i>-san,</i>
Turtle<i>-san</i>, we're off. Take care.

202
00:18:22,645 --> 00:18:24,615
"Piccolo."

203
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,055
Make sure to eat all your meals!

204
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:30,885
Send me a letter every day!

205
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:32,255
Bye!

206
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,535
This is a little exciting, huh?

207
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:52,875
Say, Bulma<i>-san</i>, where should I put my bag?

208
00:18:52,915 --> 00:18:57,515
You can stick it wherever you need
to, can't you?! Hurry up and sit down!

209
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:00,175
She's in a bad mood for some reason.

210
00:19:00,215 --> 00:19:04,555
Five seconds to launch!
Destination: Planet Namek!

211
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:08,585
J-Just a minute!

212
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,585
4...

213
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:10,595
3...

214
00:19:10,635 --> 00:19:11,755
2...

215
00:19:11,795 --> 00:19:13,565
1...

216
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:22,705
W-W-We still haven't f-fastened our b-b-belts!

217
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:29,575
It's too late to stop now, you know!

218
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:35,185
T-That truly is some tremendous
speed. They're out of sight already.

219
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:39,315
Gohan<i>-chan</i>! Be sure to rinse, too!

220
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,865
You can move about freely now.

221
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:55,105
Once we're out of the
atmosphere, everything calms down.

222
00:19:55,145 --> 00:19:56,735
Eh? Already?

223
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,745
I wanted to see Earth.

224
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:16,055
Huh? What are you doing, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

225
00:20:16,095 --> 00:20:19,095
How nosy! I'm changing my clothes!

226
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:22,765
You're changing? You mean,
into pajamas? You're going to bed already?

227
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:30,505
Whoops, come to think of it,
I forgot to bring pajamas myself.

228
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:31,735
What about you, Gohan?

229
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,335
I made sure I brought some.

230
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:37,315
I know it's none of my business,

231
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:41,515
but can't you do anything
about that <i>Shichigosan</i> outfit?

232
00:20:41,555 --> 00:20:43,355
This is just for the first part.

233
00:20:46,895 --> 00:20:52,125
I actually have some clothes that
I made without Mother finding out about it.

234
00:21:01,745 --> 00:21:03,175
Well?

235
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:08,875
You really do look up to Piccolo, don't you?

236
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:11,905
Yes. About the same as I do Father.

237
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:25,525
Huh? T-Those are unusual pajamas, huh?

238
00:21:25,565 --> 00:21:27,125
They look hard to sleep in.

239
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:30,495
Of course they're not
pajamas! When I saw you guys,

240
00:21:30,535 --> 00:21:34,095
I felt like an idiot for working so
hard getting ready to go into space.

241
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:40,675
Hey, did we do something wrong?

242
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:41,905
Search me.

243
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:04,565
<i>Good luck, Gohan.</i>

244
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:17,775
<i>The trio had departed for Planet Namek,</i>
<i>carrying the hopes of Goku and the others...</i>

245
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:26,315
<i>...with no way of knowing the</i>
<i>incredible terror that awaited them.</i>

246
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:48,275
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

247
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:54,145
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

248
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:56,515
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

249
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:05,025
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

250
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:11,495
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

251
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:15,605
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

252
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:19,105
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

253
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:21,775
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

254
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:29,285
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

255
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,355
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

256
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,185
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

257
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:39,255
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

258
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:44,935
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

259
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:47,095
<i>So sorry.</i>

260
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:52,205
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

261
00:23:54,915 --> 00:24:00,185
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

262
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:13,695
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

263
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:17,735
<i>It's already been a week since</i>
<i>Gohan and the others left Earth, huh?</i>

264
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:19,965
<i>Outer space sure is a boring place, huh?</i>

265
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:22,035
<i>Bulma-san, please, look closely at this.</i>

266
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:24,335
<i>There's something moving in front of us.</i>

267
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,135
<i>Could they be, by any chance, aliens?!</i>

268
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,905
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

269

<i>"Friends or Foes? Children of</i>
