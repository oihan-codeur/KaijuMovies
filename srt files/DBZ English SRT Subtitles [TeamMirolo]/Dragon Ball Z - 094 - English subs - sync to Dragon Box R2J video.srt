You were planning to

You're so pathetic!

20
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:17,105
Too bad!

21
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,115

Goku, hurry up and complete
this "<i>Genki Dama</i>" of yours!

Aren't you done yet, Son Goku?!

28
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,905
Haven't you completed the <i>Genki Dama</i> yet?!

29
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:52,535
That Freeza creep is
quite thoroughly pissed off!

30
00:03:52,575 --> 00:03:57,545
I-It's no good! This is still
going to take some time!

31
00:03:57,585 --> 00:04:00,485
Shoot it! Shoot it, already!

32
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:05,355
I-It's no use... Just a little longer...

33
00:05:01,615 --> 00:05:03,415
For someone too stubborn to die...

34
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:06,215
Are you still hanging around here?

35
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:11,255
I'll show you the power of
someone too stubborn to die!

Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

37
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:15,985
Piccolo may be intent on dying.

38
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:21,695
He probably used up the greater part of
his power in that blindside attack earlier.

39
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:32,435
He's risking his own life to buy
time for Goku to finish the <i>Genki Dama</i>!

40
00:05:33,615 --> 00:05:34,575
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

41
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:36,605
Wait, Gohan!

42
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:51,625
Goku, please hurry!

43
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:16,755
That was useless.

44
00:07:06,945 --> 00:07:09,775
Didn't you get it when
I told you it was useless?

45
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:17,275
Apparently, you wish to die early.

46
00:07:21,285 --> 00:07:24,885
<i>Goku! Hurry...</i>

47
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:28,585
<i>hurry and complete the Genki Dama!</i>

48
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:35,925

Tenshinhan...

51
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:08,755
These guys pushed Vegeta
around like he was a baby! Be careful!

52
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:16,765
Here goes!

53
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,455
Oh, look out!

54
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:51,745
Save me!

55
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:22,635
You guys,

56
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:26,645
Attack! Attack, I say!

57
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:29,645
That's easy for you to say!

58
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:35,125
They're even... stronger...
guys than... Vegeta was!

59
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:42,095
Dammit, I'll do it!

60
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,605
What?

61
00:09:57,645 --> 00:10:00,775
You're weaker than we thought, aren't you?!

62
00:10:04,285 --> 00:10:06,585
What?!

63
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,245
We can win this!

64
00:10:08,285 --> 00:10:10,125
All right, me too!

65
00:10:17,565 --> 00:10:22,225
I get it! It's not that they're
weak, it's that we're strong!

66
00:10:22,265 --> 00:10:23,735
This is the result of our training!

67
00:10:23,775 --> 00:10:27,105
The fruits of having received
Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s judicious training!

68
00:10:29,605 --> 00:10:31,235
They're better than I thought.

69
00:10:31,275 --> 00:10:35,775
Hey, if we get serious, they'll be no problem!

70
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:40,775
Hey, ReaCoom, shake it off!

71
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,115
Nice! This is how it ought to be!

72
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:58,235
I am totally up for this!

73
00:10:58,275 --> 00:11:03,765
<i>ReaCoom Body Attack</i>!!

74
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:08,775
<i>All right...!</i>

75
00:11:19,965 --> 00:11:21,925
Hey!

76
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:26,595
Ginyu Special Corps' Red Magma, Jheese!

77
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:31,795
Ginyu Special Corps' Blue Hurricane, Butta!

78
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:05,435
Now!

79
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:15,945
Goku, isn't the <i>Genki Dama</i> ready yet?

80
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,905
Still longer, Goku?

81
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:21,775
I've just about reached my limit.

82
00:13:24,285 --> 00:13:27,585
Just a little longer...

83
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:31,785
Just a little longer, and it will beat Freeza...

84
00:13:40,965 --> 00:13:44,805
As you wish, I'll kill you first.

85
00:14:55,945 --> 00:15:01,775
Those guys, they scraped that
together with what little <i>ki</i> they had left!

86
00:15:13,595 --> 00:15:18,895
That there should still be some
flies there that had not run away...

87
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:23,765
You folks really are
good at annoying someone...

88
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:33,405
This is as far as it goes!

89
00:15:33,445 --> 00:15:38,445
I'm going to trash you,
along with the whole planet!

90
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:03,445
Goku! Still not yet?!

91
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:38,435
Okay, it's finished!

92
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:52,455
Do it, Goku!

93
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:55,455
Father!

94
00:17:17,255 --> 00:17:20,415
O-Oh, crap!

95
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,095
Get down!

96
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:42,105
I-I'll just take this and...

97
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:30,785
I-I'll just take this and...

98
00:18:57,615 --> 00:19:06,115
I'll take this and...

99
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,815
Oh, what's this?!

100
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:16,885
H-He did it! Goku beat
Freeza... He beat Freeza!!

101
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:22,225
Yeah, he really beat Freeza!
He did it! He did it!

102
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,735
–He beat him!
–Goku did it!

103
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,565
Has Freeza<i>-sama</i> lost?

104
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:31,005
I-Impossible!

105
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,535
It's a lie!

106
00:20:36,885 --> 00:20:39,845
Goku has won!

107
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:41,875
He did it!

108
00:21:15,385 --> 00:21:17,225
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

109
00:21:19,395 --> 00:21:22,025
Yo! You all right?

110

Y-Yes!

111
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:47,745
It's all completely changed.

112
00:21:47,785 --> 00:21:49,885
Yeah.

113
00:21:49,925 --> 00:21:51,755
Where's Father?

114
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:54,125
Where's Uncle Piccolo?

115
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:21,745
