<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,000
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:36,760
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,300
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:52,190
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:04,700
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,160
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,670
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:37,070
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,130
Nine days from today,
on the morning of the 21st,

17
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,130
I have decided to hold a martial
arts tournament, called the Cell Games.

18
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,300
In the event that all representative
warriors are defeated by me,

19
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,930
I have decided to kill
every last person in the world.

20
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,560
What?!

21
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,480
<i>S-Something astounding has happened!</i>

22
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:28,740
<i>"Goku and Gohan... The Hero</i>
<i>Father and Son's Ultimate Level-Up."</i>

23
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,340
<i>After Cell's television broadcast</i>
<i>the entire world went into disarray.</i>

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,220
<i>As such, people began their</i>
<i>futile efforts to hide themselves,</i>

25
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,300
<i>so as to avoid becoming</i>
<i>targets, no matter how small.</i>

26
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,980
W-What are you doing?! Hurry it up!

27
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,230
That monster is going to be coming!

28
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,480
The hell with it!

29
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,150
You stupid punk!

30
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:21,290
<i>It was indeed a panic.</i>

31
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,520
I feel like running somewhere far away myself.

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,520
But no matter where
you run, it will be the same.

33
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
That's right.

34
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,020
Cell said if all the representative
warriors were beaten,

35
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,900
he would kill every human
throughout the world, after all.

36
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,700
I-I know! What if we were to use
the spaceship at Bulma's house

37
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,620
to escape to some faraway planet?

38
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,870
Oolong!

39
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:56,410
After all, Cell might not
come chasing after us into space.

40
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,290
You have no feelings for Yamucha-<i>sama</i>
or Kuririn-<i>san</i>, or the others, do you?

41
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,290
You lousy traitor.

42
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,310
T-This is all my fault! If only, at that time...

43
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,060
I had destroyed No. 18...

44
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,450
I'm going to go fight Cell!

45
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,910
What?!

46
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,460
It's my fault!

47
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,460
Kuririn!

48
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,290
You must not go!

49
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,430
He is not a foe you can fight and win.

50
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,720
As your master, I will not
allow you to throw your life away!

51
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,520
If you absolutely must do this,

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,190
then you can wait until
the Cell Games have begun.

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,490
Don't be so hard on yourself, Kuririn.

54
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,950
Put your money on Goku and the others.

55
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,500
How much can those Saiyans, with the
ridiculous power they keep under wraps,

56
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,920
power themselves up in
the Room of Spirit and Time?

57
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:36,890
How long will it be before
Goku-<i>san</i> and Gohan-<i>san</i> come out?

58
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,020
Still nearly three more hours before one full day.

59
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,900
Hmph! They won't necessarily
come out after one full day.

60
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,860
They could get greedy and
go considerably over their time.

61
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,990
There's no reason to be hasty.

62
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,700
There's still nine more
days until the day of the fight.

63
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,870
It hasn't even been one whole day
since you came out of the room, right?

64
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,870
You'd better get a little rest.

65
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,500
I will go in first.

66
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,210
That will be an outright waste of time.

67
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,290
What lies ahead is a domain
that only Saiyans can set foot into.

68
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,260
Fine, I'll let you do as you like,

69
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,510
but then I will take the remaining eight days.

70
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,430
It's too bad about that.

71
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,730
You can only go into the Room of Spirit and Time

72
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,900
for two days–48 hours–during your lifetime.

73
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,320
W-What?

74
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,530
What will happen... if you go over 48 hours?

75
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,660
Exit from room vanishes. Can never leave again.

76
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,790
Still, Dad, we can use it
for about 23 more hours.

77
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,600
Those are Goku and Gohan's <i>ki.</i>

78
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,320
Have they already come out of the room?

79
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,150
What? Why would they, as early as this?

80
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,320
Oh? Vegeta and Trunks are here too!

81
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,360
I feel Cell's <i>ki</i> too, so he's alive.

82
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,740
What in the world is going on?

83
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,410
Is that Gohan? I hardly recognized him!

84
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,210
Tell me what's going on.

85
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,300
Well, as it happens...

86
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,140
Say, before that, Mister Popo,
would you make us something to eat?

87
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm unbelievably famished, and all!

88
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,900
That's just like you, Goku.

89
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,330
Yum, yum!

90
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,490
Indeed, this is sure delicious!

91
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,430
Goku, I'd like to
ask you something...

92
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,770
You guys... did supposedly eat food
while you were in there, didn't you?

93
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,560
Om cosh me ane!

94
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,530
Me nin ean, mun nee'eh me nonn No'an
can coom ennyninn neshenn, shee?

95
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,780
Sho ish minn a nonn naim shinsh
me man ennynin nish nummy!

96
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,330
Hey, don't talk until you've properly
swallowed what you have in your mouth.

97
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,120
Be sure you chew!

98
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,050
Of course we ate!

99
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,470
We did eat, but neither me nor
Gohan can cook anything decent, right?

100
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,930
So it's been a long time since
we had anything this yummy!

101
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,180
S-So that's it.

102
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,440
What is that? Is that Super Saiyan?

103
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,440
No... the air about them is a little different.

104
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,410
They're in that state as if
it were natural for them!

105
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:10,290
Thank you for providing this feast!

106
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,660
Ooh, I'm full, I'm full!

107
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,920
Sorry to keep you waiting, Trunks. Start talking.

108
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,340
R-Right! As it happens...

109
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,560
Hey! Hey!

110
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,190
You're sure caught up in that.
Do you see something?

111
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,520
Out of the way!

112
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,400
We can't go forward, you know!

113
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,940
That's right, that's right!

114
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Weren't you coming this way?

115
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,910
If you're not coming, then I'll go to you.

116
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:53,430
You forgot something!

117
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,920
I don't get any of this...

118
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,510
This part here is strange too...

119
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,880
This is really no use trying to figure out...

120
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,070
What does all this mean?

121
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,320
I took a peek into No. 16's memory,

122
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,900
and it's all information about Son-<i>kun.</i>

123
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,570
What, now? What, now?

124
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,080
I see.

125
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:00,870
Yeah.

126
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:07,750
I'm sure No. 16 is an Artificial Human who
Doctor Gero built solely to defeat Son-<i>kun.</i>

127
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:17,970
But right now, he doesn't
show that manner at all, huh?

128
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,270
Either that, or I wonder if somewhere even now,

129
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,070
he's thinking that he'd like to beat Son-<i>kun.</i>

130
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,110
Nah...

131
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:35,950
He has a complex manner about
him that I don't completely understand,

132
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:38,740
but I can't bring myself to
think he's that bad a guy.

133
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,000
In any event, there's no doubt that he
possesses an unusual gentleness to him.

134
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,340
That's true, huh?

135
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:57,760
Maybe it's a result of history being changed,

136
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,770
but if you think about it,
this may turn out to be lucky.

137
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,110
After all, he's become a valuable
warrior, who will fight against Cell for us.

138
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,440
Strange things do happen, don't they?

139
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,120
So that's how it is, then?

140
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,620
A martial arts tournament, huh?

141
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,960
He sure has thought up something interesting.

142
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,960
I-Interesting, you say?

143
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,920
Mister Popo, my <i>gi</i> ain't been thrown out, right?

144
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,880
N-No, not thrown out.

145
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,110
I washed and left it.

146
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,900
Thank you, Mister Popo.

147
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,320
You don't have to wear that.

148
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,450
If you ask Mom, she'll give you a new one.

149
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,990
Naw. This is still best.

150
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,370
I want to fight as an Earthling, as well.

151
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,880
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, I want new clothes too.

152
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,880
Your clothes, Piccolo-<i>san.</i>

153
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,720
Understood. I'll present
you with something handsome.

154
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,370
Thank you, Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

155
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,900
So...

156
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,280
How about it?

157
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,530
Do you think you have
what it takes to defeat Cell?

158
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,070
I don't know!

159
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,910
I ain't seen him since he's
become that perfect form of his.

160
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,330
I think I'll go have a look at him right now.

161
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,470
Son Goku, huh?

162
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,810
Yeah. That's right.

163
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,730
What do you think?

164
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,230
This is the ring of the Cell Games,

165
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,440
which will determine the fate
of the world nine days from now.

166
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,440
Do you like it?

167
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,900
It's an awfully puny ring to determine any fate.

168
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,740
So, you've finally turned into it, huh?

169
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,160
That's your perfect form, then?

170
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,320
That is correct.

171
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,970
W-What's going on?

172
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,100
S-Such a ferocious <i>ki</i>! Is that Cell?

173
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,100
Yeah. But that's not all.

174
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,020
There's one other, mind-boggling <i>ki</i> there...

175
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,820
Goku!

176
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,450
It's Goku's <i>ki</i>!

177
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,740
You've finally come out, haven't you,
from the Room of Spirit and Time?

178
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,010
I will be sure to come for
the matches. So until then,

179
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:14,350
don't you kill even a single person! Got that?

180
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,530
It looks like it will be a good match.

181
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,720
Son Goku, huh?

182
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,380
It seems that this will be an even
more enjoyable event than I thought.

183
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,350
H-How was it, Goku-<i>san</i>?

184
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:01,400
To be honest, I didn't think
he had gotten that strong.

185
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,900
I couldn't guess how strong
he could become if he felt like it.

186
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,700
I won't know until I try,

187
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,910
but the way things are,
I probably can't win, I bet.

188
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,750
T-That can't be!

189
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,050
Is that so?

190
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:31,010
You'd better use the Room
of Spirit and Time again.

191
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,720
There is still time.

192
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,680
We just made up the order.

193
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,890
After this, I will go in,

194
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:39,020
and then I understand
Vegeta will be going in alone.

195
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:44,020
Hmph. But really, once I go in,
none of this will be necessary.

196
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,400
You'll excuse me, but I took a pass.

197
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,400
He's just not the kind of
opponent I can match up against.

198
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,030
And then, Trunks.

199
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:59,080
After that, Goku and Gohan,
you two will go in again.

200
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,000
–No, me and Gohan have had enough.
–What?!

201
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,380
We'll train in the outer world.

202
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,930
We have nine whole days,
so something will turn out.

203
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,010
W-What did you say?!

204
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,110
<i>W-What's this? Goku says</i>
<i>they will train in the outer world?</i>

205
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,610
<i>Does Goku have some chance of winning?</i>

206
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,630
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

207
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,470
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

208
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,840
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

209
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,310
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

210
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,820
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

211
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,950
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

212
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

213
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

214
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,580
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

215
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,670
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

216
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,510
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

217
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,510
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

218
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:45,180
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

219
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,350
<i>So sorry.</i>

220
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:52,480
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

221
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,490
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

222
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,710
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

223
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,380
<i>Gohan, our next training is to go</i>
<i>home, take it easy, and rest up.</i>

224
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,510
<i>Ain't no sense in forcing</i>
<i>ourselves to train any further.</i>

225
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,020
<i>Gohan-chan! What's the matter with your hair?!</i>

226
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,100
<i>Have you gone and turned delinquent?!</i>

227
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,940
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

228
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,230
<i>"Goku's Composure!?</i>
<i>Let's Rest and Wait for the Cell Games."</i>

229
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,270
<i>Are you sure we should be taking it so easily?</i>

230
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,690
"Next time"
"Goku's Composure!?
Let's Rest and Wait for the Cell Games"
