6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:52,190
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>

15
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,960
<i>Piccolo continues his</i>

20
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,030
<i>he must hold out, no matter what!</i>

21
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,500
<i>Elsewhere, Bulma had</i>

<i>...that can shut down the actions</i>

23
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,130
<i>However...</i>

24
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,240
<i>Already out of time, Cell reveals</i>
<i>himself to absorb No. 17 and No. 18!</i>

25
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,800
<i>"The Suicide Counterattack Proves Ineffective!</i>
<i>Piccolo's Flame Burns Out!!"</i>

26
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,270
C-Cell!

27
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,110
Hell, I was preoccupied with
the fight, and didn't notice him!

28
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,290
What's with that strange guy?

29
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,090
<i>What? Doesn't he know?</i>

30
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,130
<i>No. 17 and the others don't know about Cell!</i>

31
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,890
At last, the day of commemoration has arrived!

32
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,390
The day when I merge with No. 17...

33
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,270
...and No. 18 and become my perfect form!

34
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,270
No. 17!

35
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,110
No. 18!

36
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,110
Who is this one?

37
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,450
Judging by his Red Ribbon marking,

38
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,120
I have to think he is one of
Doctor Gero's Artificial Humans.

39
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,630
Well, in any case, he is an older model.

40
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,130
It will be okay to ignore him.

41
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,590
What are you going to do about it, Piccolo?

42
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,130
If you wish to interfere, come right ahead.

43
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,310
For you to have powered up to that extent–

44
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,730
Just how many people have you sacrificed?!

45
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,770
Sacrifice? Hmph, rubbish!

46
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,570
On the contrary, it is an honor
to become a fraction of my power.

47
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,200
What?!

48
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,680
H-How can it be?!

49
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,800
Cell's <i>ki</i> has gone up unbelievably!

50
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,810
It's all over now! We're powerless!

51
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,350
There's nothing we can do!

52
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,030
For Bulma to bring that controller
to stop No. 17 and the others,

53
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,360
it'll take her 20 minutes,
however fast she may be!

54
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,120
In that case, you could go and
get this controller thing from her.

55
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,670
Doin' that would get it to you
faster than just waitin' around here.

56
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,300
T-That's it!

57
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,550
You guys are all soft in the head!

58
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,300
That's how you get from
doin' nothin' but fightin'.

59
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,800
I'm going to go fly there and pick it up!

60
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,970
If I fly all-out, I'm a lot
faster than Bulma-<i>san</i>'s plane!

61
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,310
Kuririn...

62
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,190
I'm going to go help Piccolo!

63
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Even if I can't do anything for him,
it's better than just waiting here!

64
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,320
S-Stop!

65
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,740
Tenshinhan, get back here!

66
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,710
Do you want to throw your life away?!

67
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,130
Damn, there's not a thing I can do now.

68
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,550
I yearn for the days when
I was acclaimed as Muten Roshi,

69
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,760
the greatest in the world.

70
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,270
Goku, hurry and finish your
training, and come back to us!

71
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,520
You may get a year's
worth of training in one day,

72
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,320
but right now, that one day is too long!

73
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,780
<i>Goku-sa! Gohan-chan!</i>

74
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,920
<i>Still not yet, Vegeta?!</i>

75
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,070
I don't know what you are,
but you're in the way!

76
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,490
Get lost at once!

77
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,570
I'm playing with him right now.

78
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,630
No. 17!! He plans to kill you
and absorb you into himself!!

79
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,130
–Run!!
–What?

80
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,630
Sneak attack? Toy with me, will you?

81
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,130
What is this?

82
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,470
This monster is going to absorb me?

83
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,140
In short, his name is Cell,

84
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,480
and he's a beast that's been
created up by Doctor Gero's computer!

85
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,850
He's still incomplete, but
once he absorbs you and No. 18,

86
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,020
it seems he will finally
become his perfect form.

87
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,560
What did he say?

88
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,150
Rejoice, my siblings!

89
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,660
When you become a part of my body,

90
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,910
it will mean the birth of
the perfect super-being,

91
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,490
with power greater than any other!

92
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:38,040
We will be the very ultimate warrior that
Doctor Gero was pursuing all those years!

93
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,380
That's enough of your nonsense!

94
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,050
You expect me to let myself
be absorbed by the likes of you?!

95
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,050
And as for ultimate warriors,
there's already one here!

96
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:50,430
Your will is of no matter.

97
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,600
That you will be absorbed is already certain!

98
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,060
I'm going to silence that
troublesome mouth of yours for you!

99
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,270
Get out of there, No. 17!

100
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,650
The enemy's battle power is far too great!

101
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,280
He must not be allowed his perfect form!

102
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,280
His aim is no longer the death of Son Goku...

103
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,780
...he intends to destroy the whole universe!

104
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,290
My, my.

105
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:21,380
Here I'm thinking you finally
have something decent to say,

106
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,540
and you tell me to run away?

107
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,430
Don't you make me the fool!!

108
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,870
Die!!

109
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,680
Dammit!

110
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,060
Are both No. 17 and that guy
like Piccolo just being sloppy?

111
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,730
That isn't it.

112
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,810
This Cell guy is just too strong for them.

113
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,700
You at least should run away, No. 18.

114
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,910
No. 17 will not listen to my warning.

115
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,290
If No. 17 is absorbed, he will
be beyond anyone's control.

116
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,250
It will be the end of the world.

117
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:30,300
What are you going to do, No. 16?

118
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,120
You go to hell!

119
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,120
Yikes!

120
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,520
Piccolo got him!

121
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,730
He did not get him.

122
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,520
On the contrary, he has not even taken damage.

123
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,310
H-How can this be?!

124
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,100
There's nothing that can be done!

125
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,520
Our worlds are too different!

126
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,890
Get out of here, No. 17!!

127
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,080
His neck is broken! This is bad!

128
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,550
It appears I've gotten
too strong for you, haven't I?

129
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,880
It's because I got overly enthusiastic...

130
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,510
...and killed more humans for
their energy than was necessary.

131
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,520
See you around.

132
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,740
H-He did him in!

133
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,700
His <i>ki</i> has vanished. Then we weren't in time?

134
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,700
Kami-<i>sama</i>!

135
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,930
Gohan!

136
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,720
Wait, Gohan!

137
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:01,850
Piccolo-<i>sama</i>!! Piccolo-<i>sama</i>!!

138
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,990
Gohan! If you go now, you can't beat him!

139
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,690
Wait!

140
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,530
In any case, all we can do is wait!

141
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,710
<i>Still not yet, Vegeta? What are you doing?!</i>

142
00:21:55,910 --> 00:22:02,080
<i>Piccolo at length has fallen before</i>
<i>the terrifying Artificial Human Cell.</i>

143
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,420
<i>At this rate, he will absorb No. 17 and No. 18...</i>

144
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,710
<i>...and become his perfect form.</i>

145
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:16,590
<i>Will Vegeta, Goku and the others make it in time?</i>

146
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,380
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

147
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:53,220
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

148
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,590
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

149
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,060
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

150
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,570
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

151
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,700
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

152
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,200
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

153
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,830
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

154
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:28,330
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

155
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,420
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

156
