<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,780
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,770
<i>Out in space, the figures</i>
<i>of the Ginyu Special Corps,</i>

17
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,370
<i>who were approaching Planet Namek</i>
<i>under orders from Freeza, had appeared.</i>

18
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,680
How about we try drastically raising our pace?

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,150
As far away as we've come,
there's no way Vegeta will know.

20
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:17,020
Y-You're right. Father will
be here really soon, and all.

21
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,190
<i>With no way of knowing that,</i>

22
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,030
<i>Gohan and Kuririn were rushing</i>
<i>to the Grand Elder at top speed.</i>

23
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:26,000
I've found you at last!

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,340
You're going to pay this
time for sure! Brace yourselves!

25
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,480
<i>Vegeta had begun to</i>
<i>pursue them at breakneck speed.</i>

26
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,490
<i>Would Gohan and Kuririn be able to escape?</i>

27
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:57,030
<i>"The Great Battle Approaches!</i>
<i>The Ginyu Special Corps Now Takes the Stage!!"</i>

28
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,980
Hang in there, Gohan!
Grand Elder<i>-san</i>'s place is just ahead!

29
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,110
Right!

30
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,320
<i>I might have said that once we have the</i>
<i>Grand Elder draw out Gohan's dormant power,</i>

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,960
<i>he would rival Vegeta, but to be honest,</i>
<i>I doubt we can expect that much.</i>

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,430
<i>That bastard really does have a gift.</i>
<i>There's no end to how strong he's becoming.</i>

33
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,370
<i>After having Gohan made stronger,</i>
<i>all we can do is wait for Goku to get here,</i>

34
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,540
<i>and then have all three of us fight together.</i>

35
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,500
9999...

36
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,470
10,000...

37
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,720
Amazing! I'm hardly tired at all!
I've surprised myself!

38
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,620
Now then, all right, that's all for my training.

39
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,990
With the time that's left, I'll rest up.

40
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,970
I have to get used to
regular gravity again, too.

41
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:35,690
I did it! What agility!

42
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:40,690
I'm so surprised! I'm so light,
it feels like I ain't even here!

43
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,700
Whoo! Light! Light!

44
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,600
So light, so light, so light, I say!

45
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,530
And strong, and strong!

46
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:01,110
After building myself up this much, I'm sure
I'll be able to withstand a ten tim <i>es Kaio-ken</i>!

47
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,060
"Shampoo"

48
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,300
I'm almost to Planet Namek, huh?
All right, let's do this! Let's do this!

49
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,530
Whew, that was refreshing.

50
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,710
Now, all that's left is to sleep tight.

51
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,080
But let's take a moment before doing that.

52
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,650
Let's see... here it is.

53
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,720
Huh? My mistake.
This stuff is bitter, after all.

54
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,920
Let's see... here it is, here it is, this, this!

55
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,800
Bulma's daddy's specially-made sports drink!

56
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,970
<i>Goku had not realized that</i>
<i>at some point along the way,</i>

57
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:04,640
<i>he had obtained a level of power</i>
<i>that went beyond Saiyan limits.</i>

58
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:20,620
<i>Almost there. Almost there, you dirty punks!</i>

59
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,340
Gohan, it's coming into view!

60
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,870
You see that tall mountain
there? That's where he is.

61
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,550
All right, we're in the home stretch!

62
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,320
G-Gohan, there's a <i>ki</i>!
There's a <i>ki</i> coming from behind us!

63
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,300
I-It can't be!

64
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,740
I-It couldn't be... Vegeta!

65
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,780
Gohan, I'll use all of my
strength to stop him here.

66
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,980
You go on to Grand Elder<i>-san</i>'s place!

67
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:16,650
But...

68
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,520
Hurry up! Go get yourself made stronger!

69
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,020
Okay?

70
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,020
Right!

71
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,800
All right...

72
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,700
In any case, I have to try.

73
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,730
<i>What speed!</i>

74
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,660
Yo.

75
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,330
I-I'm impressed that you discovered us.

76
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,300
Of course I did. I'm in a
completely different league than you are.

77
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:16,680
Now, why don't you return to me the Dragon
Ball with the four stars that I had hidden?

78
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,680
You've made a mockery of me!

79
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,280
W-What in the world are you talking about?

80
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:25,790
Don't play dumb. I'll make you talk soon enough.

81
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,300
This is incredible!

82
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,180
What's that?

83
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,950
That mountain where Kakarrot's son fled to...

84
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,620
There's something else there.

85
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,620
That's where you've hidden the ball, is it?

86
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,820
It is not!

87
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,520
Wait!

88
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,600
You have a tremendous amount
of dormant power, don't you?

89
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,930
Are you not an Earthling?

90
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,970
Excuse me, but could I ask you to hurry?

91
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,670
They are here.

92
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,150
What is this place?

93
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,990
Wait, Vegeta!

94
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,020
Please wait!

95
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,730
Leave here.

96
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,800
Looks like you want to die.

97
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,330
<i>H-He did it! Gohan's ki has risen!</i>

98
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,670
So that's it. Kakarrot is here, is he?

99
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,010
All right, today's the
day when we settle things!

100
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,680
Come on out, Kakarrot!

101
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,920
What?!

102
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,840
I-It's you?! What did you do in there?!

103
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,220
Why has your base power risen so sharply?!

104
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,040
It's true,

105
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,080
your battle power seems to have risen to
a level incomparable to what it was before.

106
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,310
Even so...

107
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,120
...are you telling me you want to
exchange blows with me at your level?

108
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,820
Very well.

109
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,810
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

110
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,670
D-Dende...

111
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:10,980
Y-Yes?

112
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:20,690
Go tell everyone at once... There is a large,
mysterious power approaching Namek.

113
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,020
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

114
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,690
Quickly!

115
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,990
R-Right!

116
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,710
L-Listen, Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> says that
there is something approaching this world!

117
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,040
–Huh?
–What?!

118
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,340
Grand Elder? Who's that?

119
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,010
I-It's true! There really is something up there!

120
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,650
I-It's an incredible power!

121
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,650
I-It's Goku! Goku has finally gotten here!

122
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,320
What?

123
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,660
I'm not so sure. It doesn't
feel like there's just one...

124
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,570
I-It couldn't be!

125
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,680
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... No doubt about it!

126
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,020
Freeza has called in the Ginyu Special Corps!

127
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,790
Damn it all!

128
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,020
You guys, hand over your
Dragon Ball to me, now!

129
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,360
N-No way! We won't do that!

130
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,000
I promise you, once I gain
the power of immortality,

131
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,700
in no way will I do anything to you!

132
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,370
Hurry, or there will be no
undoing what will happen!

133
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,710
Y-You think you can fool us?!

134
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,410
If we do that, we'll be
playing right into your hands!

135
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,680
Listen to me closely, you dirty bastards!

136
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,020
This Ginyu Special Corps that
Freeza has called in has five men,

137
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,730
each of which is as strong as me–
no, probably even stronger!

138
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,930
They're going to use the
latest Scouters to find me,

139
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,300
as well as you guys, and
then come kill us at once!

140
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,360
T-That can't be true!

141
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,700
Can't you sense their power?!
There's only one path we can take!

142
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,370
The only route we have is to make
me immortal, and have me defeat them!

143
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,710
What he's saying might be true.

144
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,810
There are indeed five
great evil powers out there.

145
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,730
Well, let's make Gohan immortal!

146
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:48,140
He might have the power, but he's
utterly lacking in tactical experience!

147
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,310
B-But then... if that's the case...
why the hell did we even come here?!

148
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:58,810
The Dragon Balls can grant you three wishes.

149
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,990
You guys will be sure to have your wish granted.

150
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,150
Three? Not just one?

151
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,990
T-Three?

152
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,400
Y-You guys!

153
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,330
Why do you keep repeating it?! Snap to it!

154
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,670
Who knows if there's going to be enough time?!

155
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:30,510
L-Listen, we really... we really
can have three wishes granted, right?

156
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,820
Come with me!

157
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,520
But we're going to make sure you
keep your promise, you got that?!

158
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,870
Wait for me!

159
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,330
Damn it!

160
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:54,530
Fly as fast as you can!

161
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,010
It looks like they've left, huh?

162
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:13,020
Yes. But even if it works out, their
chances of winning are extremely low.

163
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,350
Nail<i>-san...</i>

164
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,880
Nail...

165
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,360
You go on as well. You want
to help out some, don't you?

166
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,360
But...

167
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,030
If it's about me, I'll be all right.

168
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:29,530
My life should still
hold out for a little while.

169
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,550
Understood.

170
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,600
So, you have arrived at last, Ginyu
Special Corps. I have been waiting for you.

171
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,640
Aren't we there yet?! They've already landed!

172
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,600
<i>Just a little farther.</i>

173
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,480
Why does this have to happen to me?

174
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,290
W-What in the world was that?!

175
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,290
Huh?

176
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,790
Bulma<i>-san</i>, I'm taking the Dragon Ball with me.

177
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,030
All right, hurry! This way now!

178
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,830
H-Hey, what exactly is going on?!

179
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,310
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

180
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,310
Hold on! Explain what's
happening before you go!

181
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,280
Do you know the kind of
trouble I've had to go through?!

182
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,950
For crying out loud!

183
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,330
Really, when it comes to
those guys, I've just about–

184
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,660
Huh? Wasn't that Vegeta with them just now?

185
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,710
ReaCoom!

186
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,100
Butta!

187
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,240
Jheese!

188
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,000
Ghurd!

189
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,480
Ginyu!

190
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,680
To-geth-er we are...

191
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,620
The Ginyu Special Corps!

192
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,200
I-I have been expecting you.

193
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,010
<i>The tense situation was</i>
<i>starting to change rapidly.</i>

194
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,890
<i>Who exactly are the Ginyu Special Corps,</i>
<i>whom even Vegeta is afraid of?</i>

195
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:26,200
<i>To whom will go the Dragon Balls,</i>
<i>along with their wishes?</i>

196
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,050
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

197
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:53,890
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

198
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:56,260
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

199
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,730
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

200
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,280
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

201
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,380
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

202
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,880
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

203
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,520
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

204
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:29,030
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

205
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,130
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

206
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,930
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

207
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,970
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

208
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:44,640
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

209
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,810
<i>So sorry.</i>

210
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:51,950
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

211
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:59,960
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

212
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,640
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

213
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,440
<i>Freeza, I ain't letting you guys have your way!</i>

214
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,340
<i>Commander Ginyu, please rough</i>
<i>up Vegeta and the two earthlings,</i>

215
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,280
<i>without killing them, and bring them here.</i>

216
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,620
<i>I would like to make them tell me</i>
<i>where the Dragon Balls are hidden.</i>

217
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,390
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

218
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,020
<i>"Goku on Final Approach!</i>
<i>Smash Through Freeza's Dragnet."</i>

219
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,130
<i>Father! Hurry! Hurry!</i>

220
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,660
"Next time"
"Goku on Final Approach!
Smash Through Freeza's Dragnet"

221
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:35,000
<i>Father! Hurry! Hurry!</i>
