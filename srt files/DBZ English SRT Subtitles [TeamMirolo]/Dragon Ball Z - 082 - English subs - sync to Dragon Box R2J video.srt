<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:06,935
<i>Priding himself on his overwhelming strength,</i>
<i>Freeza fights toe-to-toe against Piccolo.</i>

17
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:30,055
<i>Following Freeza's momentary advance,</i>

18
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:35,435
<i>Piccolo takes the offensive,</i>
<i>and lands some well-placed punches.</i>

19
00:03:15,245 --> 00:03:17,735
Why, you...

20
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:26,415
<i>"Attack, Goku!! An Enraged</i>
<i>Freeza's Second Transformation."</i>

21
00:03:29,925 --> 00:03:33,225
Incredible! He's holding his own against Freeza!

22
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:36,555
No, he's doing better!

23
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:39,565
You really are incredible, Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

24
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:42,725
<i>Just what the hell has happened?</i>

25
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:47,565
<i>It hasn't been that long</i>
<i>since he was defeated on Earth!</i>

26
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:50,575
We might actually be able to get
out of this without dying, Gohan!

27
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:51,945
Right!

28
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:58,545
<i>Beat that Freeza, who killed so many of us,</i>

29
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,915
<i>using the power of Nail-san!</i>

30
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:09,385
<i>What kind of training has Piccolo undergone?</i>

31
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:13,095
<i>That's the way, stick</i>
<i>with him until I get better!</i>

32
00:04:24,645 --> 00:04:29,075
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, with Piccolo
powered-up as much as he is,

33
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:30,575
can he defeat Freeza?

34
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:33,455
If he doesn't beat him for us, we're screwed!

35
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:46,285
So fast! And I should
have the advantage of speed!

36
00:05:59,975 --> 00:06:01,835
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

37
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,875
How can this be?

38
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:08,275
You mean, he hasn't been
taking this seriously up until now?

39
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:11,715
What's the best step for me to take now?

40
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:14,245
<i>What should I do?</i>

41
00:06:20,265 --> 00:06:23,755
<i>Damn you for making us rejoice prematurely!</i>

42
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,595
<i>Nail-san...</i>

43
00:06:27,265 --> 00:06:32,105
<i>Piccolo! What kind of guy is this Freeza?!</i>

44
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:34,565
Piccolo...

45
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:36,275
Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

46
00:06:37,615 --> 00:06:42,875
I told you, they have touched
that which should not be touched...

47
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,905
<i>–Piccolo...</i>
<i>–Piccolo...</i>

48
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,405
Sorry about that just now.

49
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:15,275
I didn't give you enough credit.

50
00:07:15,315 --> 00:07:17,915
But you are capable of more than I imagined.

51
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:20,615
I decided to show you some true power.

52
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,225
Which is to say, my true power.

53
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:29,725
<i>There's no end to his power!</i>

54
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:34,595
<i>Was I really planning to fight against him?</i>

55
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:07,265
So will I. Let's make this genuine.

56
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:09,095
What's that?

57
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:15,265
You're saying you haven't
been serious up until now?

58
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:19,605
I didn't realize that
Namekians told fish stories.

59
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,945
You'll find out very soon.

60
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,585
<i>You worthless fool!</i>

61
00:08:27,625 --> 00:08:31,155
<i>To have to resort to bluffing at this stage...</i>

62
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:32,915
I-I get it!

63
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:39,925
Piccolo's been fighting with that
heavy turban and mantle on all this time?

64
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:45,305
Now realize the fury of all the
Namekians who were killed by you!!

65
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:58,075
<i>Piccolo's ki is getting stronger again.</i>
<i>This strength is the real thing!</i>

66
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,615
He can win! Piccolo<i>-san</i> can win!

67
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:04,615
Piccolo! We're counting on you!

68
00:09:04,655 --> 00:09:07,385
The situation has changed again!

69
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,955
You've removed those heavy
garments and made yourself lighter...

70
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:13,965
which is supposed to mean your
speed has become even more polished?

71
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:16,095
We'll have to see.

72
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:11,455
It will take more than this to
satisfy the fury of the Namekians!

73
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:27,635
He did it!

74
00:10:27,675 --> 00:10:28,235
Gohan!

75
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,605
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

76
00:10:35,445 --> 00:10:36,875
Nail<i>-san</i>!

77
00:10:36,915 --> 00:10:39,245
Nice going, Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

78
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:41,275
That's the way!

79
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:46,585
<i>At this rate, Kakarrot may still be in time.</i>

80
00:10:46,625 --> 00:10:50,625
<i>In which case, I may get out of this alive!</i>

81
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:58,265
And now to finish you off!

82
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,435
Has Freeza?

83
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:37,805
You don't suppose?

84
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,405
Look there!

85
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:03,735
As tenacious as I expected.

86
00:12:03,775 --> 00:12:08,735
You seem to be laboring under some
false impression concerning my true power.

87
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,605
What?!

88
00:12:18,955 --> 00:12:22,785
Did you really think that what
I just showed you was serious?

89
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:30,395
You couldn't have known I'd
transformed myself, could you?

90
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:32,055
Transformed, you say?

91
00:12:32,095 --> 00:12:36,395
I will allow you the same thing
I gave to Vegeta and the others–

92
00:12:36,435 --> 00:12:39,395
A feeling of absolute terror towards me.

93
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:43,675
All right, first I will
instill a sense of hopelessness.

94
00:12:43,715 --> 00:12:46,775
A hopelessness from knowing that
nothing you can possibly do will help!!

95
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:56,685
Every time I, Freeza, transform
myself, my power substantially grows!

96
00:12:56,725 --> 00:13:02,385
And I still have two more
transformations remaining!

97
00:13:02,425 --> 00:13:05,395
Do you know what that means?

98
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:07,595
What's this?

99
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:11,735
Impossible!

100
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:15,565
Gohan, what did he just say?

101
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:20,945
Freeza can transform two more times.

102
00:13:22,315 --> 00:13:26,185
<i>Now getting married is completely out.</i>

103
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:30,555
So then, let me show it to you.

104
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:33,555
You guys should feel honored.

105
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:38,425
You're the first ones I've ever
shown this transformation to!

106
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:57,075
Watch carefully now!

107
00:13:57,115 --> 00:14:00,955
Here comes Freeza<i>-sama</i>'s
second-stage transformation!

108
00:15:29,445 --> 00:15:32,075
I apologize for the delay.

109
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:35,845
Now then, shall we begin the battle once again?

110
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:38,245
Y-You monster!

111
00:15:47,465 --> 00:15:50,355
H-He hasn't changed all that much, has he?

112
00:15:50,395 --> 00:15:53,725
Idiot! Try probing what his latent power is!

113
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:56,625
It's completely different from a moment ago!

114
00:15:56,665 --> 00:16:01,065
Yet he's settled down again, and
he's regained his presence of mind!

115
00:16:01,105 --> 00:16:06,445
He's also lost the damage that
Piccolo<i>-san</i> had inflicted on him!

116
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:12,245
<i>Damn it all! What's going on out there?</i>

117
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:16,085
<i>That ki of Freeza's has gotten stronger again!</i>

118
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,915
<i>At this point, even once I completely recover,</i>

119
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:26,125
<i>I might not be able to beat him. Now what?</i>

120
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:32,635
<i>Freeza is a super-monster beyond imagination!</i>

121
00:16:46,685 --> 00:16:50,915
You had such confidence in
your speed earlier, did you not?

122
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:55,295
So then, shall we have another look at it?

123
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:25,715
<i>You bastard! If you've got</i>
<i>the power, I've got the speed!</i>

124
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:28,095
<i>You won't catch up to me in this lifetime!</i>

125
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:33,755
<i>I-It can't be!</i>

126
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:39,735
My goodness, it has been
too long, my little toddler.

127
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:42,965
Piccolo<i>-san</i> has lost his
speed advantage over Freeza!

128
00:17:43,005 --> 00:17:47,175
Does that mean Freeza's
power has gone up that much?

129
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:54,115
<i>Don't lose, Nail-san!</i>

130
00:18:03,765 --> 00:18:09,255
Thank goodness, you aren't dead!
I'll heal you right away!

131
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,735
<i>That's right!</i>

132
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,775
<i>There's still that trick!</i>

133
00:18:47,005 --> 00:18:48,635
<i>It's all over now, isn't it?</i>

134
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,765
<i>Piccolo...</i>

135
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:26,405
Shall we put an end to this play, then?

136
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,605
D-Damn...

137
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:36,745
You have realized that, unfortunately
enough, the speed you took such pride in

138
00:19:36,785 --> 00:19:41,425
is of utterly no use
against me now, have you not?

139
00:19:41,465 --> 00:19:43,955
I would have you give up now!

140
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:57,365
<i>S-So fast!</i>

141
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:09,825
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

142
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:27,495
They're impossibly fast!
There's no way he can dodge them!

143
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:39,445
<i>Piccolo-san...</i>

144
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:58,275
<i>Piccolo!</i>

145
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,035
<i>Piccolo!</i>

146
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,625
Stop it!

147
00:21:26,295 --> 00:21:28,135
Gohan!

148
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:32,395
Gohan! Dammit!

149
00:21:32,435 --> 00:21:33,735
Wait!

150
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,805
What are you doing, Vegeta?!

151
00:21:35,845 --> 00:21:37,735
There's no sense for you to go!

152
00:21:37,775 --> 00:21:40,135
B-But if I don't...

153
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,745
Listen here, at this rate, we're
all going to be killed by Freeza!

154
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:46,245
Never mind him, you blast me half-to-death!

155
00:21:46,285 --> 00:21:48,275
Do it now!

156
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,255
<i>Once I get that kid to heal me,</i>

157
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:57,325
<i>and rise from a near-death state one more time,</i>

158
00:21:57,365 --> 00:22:02,135
<i>I'm certain to be able to become a Super Saiyan!</i>

159
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:20,415
<i>Having transformed a second time,</i>
<i>Freeza has become even more powered-up.</i>

160
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:27,555
<i>Piccolo faces a great pinch, as Gohan</i>
<i>leaps to his aid. How will this turn out?</i>

161
00:22:44,945 --> 00:22:48,945
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

162
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:54,785
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

163
00:22:54,825 --> 00:22:57,155
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

164
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:05,655
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

165
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:12,165
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

166
00:23:12,205 --> 00:23:16,265
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

167
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:19,775
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

168
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,445
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

169
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:29,955
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

170
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:34,025
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

171
00:23:34,065 --> 00:23:35,855
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

172
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:39,855
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

173
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:45,535
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

174
00:23:45,575 --> 00:23:47,705
<i>So sorry.</i>

175
00:23:47,745 --> 00:23:52,835
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

176
00:23:55,585 --> 00:24:00,845
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

177
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,855
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

178
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:17,265
<i>Regardless of how strong Gohan</i>
<i>has become, it's no use against Freeza!</i>

179
00:24:17,305 --> 00:24:20,265
<i>When we Saiyans recover after</i>
<i>coming one step away from death,</i>

180
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:22,365
<i>our strength increases! Now, hurry!</i>

181
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:24,305
<i>Before Freeza makes his final transformation,</i>

182
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:26,635
<i>you must render me half-dead!</i>

183
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,605
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

184
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:32,275
<i>"Fear Me!! Freeza Does Battle</i>
<i>with a Third Transformation."</i>

185
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:36,485
<i>I've had it. And I hit him</i>
<i>with all the power I had, too.</i>

186
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:38,425
"Next time"
"Fear Me!! Freeza Does Battle
with a Third Transformation"
