<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,960
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,300
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:52,150
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,650
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:04,660
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,120
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,630
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:26,600
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,670
So then, I will hold a martial arts tournament.

17
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,630
A martial arts tournament?

18
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,840
In the past, there was a martial arts tournament,

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,710
called the Tenkaichi Tournament.

20
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,050
I'm saying I'm going to hold one again for you!

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,070
<i>After word from Cell that he</i>
<i>would hold a martial arts tournament,</i>

22
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,110
<i>Kuririn and the others grew restless.</i>

23
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,440
<i>To accommodate them,</i>
<i>Cell carried out step-by-step</i>

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,740
<i>his preparations for the martial arts tournament.</i>

25
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,910
It is a bit plain, but I'll think of something later.

26
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,240
Now then, how about I head
over to the television station?

27
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:18,420
<i>"100% Ratings!! The Cell Games Call for</i>
<i>Death with an Exclusive Live Broadcast."</i>

28
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,090
Oh? Hmm?

29
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,690
That's odd... I don't get this...

30
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,290
Apparently, your construction
is completely different

31
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,700
from these human-based Artificial Humans.

32
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,340
I am completely machine based,
and was built from nothing.

33
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,810
Which would mean... this
won't serve as any reference, huh?

34
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,370
Then, you cannot repair me?

35
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,490
Hey, don't you worry.

36
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,790
Once Bulma gets back, we'll manage something.

37
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,160
Bulma knows more about you guys than I do.

38
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,340
This cake truly is tasty!

39
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,340
Isn't it, though?

40
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,930
There's still plenty more, so
partake of as much as you like!

41
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,930
I'll take that huge choco crème one this time!

42
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,310
Hey, I had my eye on that one!

43
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,980
Me first!

44
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,910
The early bird gets the worm, you know! Nyah!

45
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,740
That goes for me too!

46
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,750
Enough! Stop poking around,
you're getting everything dirty!

47
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:09,380
–Hey now, this is mine here!
<i>–I-I really have to separate</i>
<i>Gohan-chan from the likes of them soon!</i>

48
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,470
Oh, my! I'm so pleased that
you're enjoying eating it so much!

49
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,140
I still have plenty more, if you like...

50
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,930
–Hey, that's mine!
–I called this one already!

51
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,980
Good grief, Oolong and the
others are so easygoing right now.

52
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,980
Yeah...

53
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:35,780
–Stop it! Old guys like you
shouldn't have so many sweets!
–You just shut up!

54
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,170
<i>Damn. What is Cell dallying around for?</i>

55
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,210
<i>If you're going to show up,</i>
<i>then hurry and show up!</i>

56
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,350
Trunks, he really told you he'd let
us know the details via television?

57
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,510
Yes, I'm sure of it.

58
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,140
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>!

59
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,440
Pu-erh, once Cell appears on the TV, let me know.

60
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm going outside to work out.

61
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,780
Right, Yamucha-<i>sama</i>!

62
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,950
There are only nine more days
until Cell holds his tournament.

63
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,830
I can't let even a second go by wasted.

64
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,700
That's the way it is, all right.

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,790
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, let me come with you.

66
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,330
Thank you, Kuririn.

67
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,170
Not at all!

68
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,300
In a tournament where there
are rules, there won't be any dying.

69
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,970
It's been a while since
I could show off what I've got!

70
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,970
Lately, I haven't been
called on for anything, after all.

71
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,340
And you guys won't be called on this time either.

72
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,850
As long as I'm there, it will be enough.

73
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,560
I'm not going to allow Kakarrot,
or anyone else to get in my way!

74
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,690
You've got a big mouth for someone
who got beaten to a pulp by Cell, don't you?

75
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,900
What was that?

76
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,860
Once I go train in the Room
of Spirit and Time another day,

77
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
I'll settle everything!

78
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,700
There won't be any place for scum like you!

79
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,990
Scum, you say?

80
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,750
I call you scum only because you are scum.

81
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,870
Dad!

82
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,920
Trunks! Trunks!

83
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,550
Trunks!

84
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,730
Trunks!

85
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,660
What's this, you're alive and kicking, aren't you?

86
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:46,870
I heard from Piccolo that you'd
gotten away without being killed,

87
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,040
but I came flying back,
worried that you'd been terribly hurt!

88
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,880
I'm quite sorry about that.

89
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,260
Indeed! You shouldn't worry your mother like that!

90
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,090
I'm sorry for making you worry so.

91
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,840
<i>Mom...</i>

92
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,100
H-Hey, now! Let go!

93
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,650
C-Come on, now! Let go!

94
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,690
Trunks can't bear to tear himself away from Trunks!

95
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,320
–Come on!
–My, is that boy also named Trunks-<i>chan</i>?

96
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,570
What a coincidence!

97
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:26,490
Come on, let me go, Trunks!

98
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,000
Come on, let me go. Come on...

99
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,700
Where are you doing the
programs that are being broadcast

100
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,210
all over the Earth?

101
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,170
O-On the top floor, S-Studio B...

102
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,880
Thanks, miss.

103
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,410
Yamucha-<i>sama</i> slipped on
Kuririn-<i>san</i>'s smooth head!

104
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:39,330
Kuririn! You can use
that head against Cell, too!

105
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,250
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, please don't make fun of me like that!

106
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,800
Still, that head of yours is quite slick.

107
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,300
You could have that
slipperiness as a secret technique!

108
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,310
M-Maybe I'll go over to Cell's side!

109
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,270
Here comes!

110
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,480
What are those two doing?

111
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:06,110
Are they going to be able to beat Cell like that?

112
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,280
This is tops!

113
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,910
Pafu-pafu, pafu-pafu...

114
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,500
You are the biggest dirty old man!

115
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,300
This is the program he likes the most.

116
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,510
It sure is!

117
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,430
A-wiggle-waggle! That's nice, nice, nice!

118
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,860
Cell!

119
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,820
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>! It's Cell! Cell showed up!

120
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,920
Miserable Cell!

121
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,700
And now, up next, world news.

122
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,250
W-Who are you?!

123
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,500
What are you doing?

124
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,300
Is this the top floor, Studio B?

125
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,510
T-That's right. C-Call the guard!

126
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,050
I will go beyond!

127
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,340
I will go beyond Super Saiyan!

128
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,190
Gohan?!

129
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,270
Gohan!

130
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,070
Gohan-<i>chan</i>! Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

131
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,740
Mother, what are you doing here?

132
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,910
I don't need a reason to be here!

133
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:04,910
How long are you plannin' on stayin'
in here without doin' any studyin'?!

134
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,000
But, Mother...

135
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,920
You're goin' to be a
great scholar in the future!

136
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,710
But if you do nothin' but trainin',

137
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,420
then instead of bein' a scholar,

138
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,880
you're goin' to become
a delinquent like Piccolo!

139
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,180
Mother, Piccolo-<i>san</i> isn't a delinquent...

140
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,510
Delinquent! Delinquent!

141
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,390
Absolutely he's a delinquent! Delinquent!

142
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,060
Piccolo's a delinquent!!

143
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,270
Sorry, Gohan...

144
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,060
I had stopped her, but she forced her way in.

145
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,230
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

146
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:32,280
Goku-<i>sa</i>!!

147
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,070
I get it. He's hidin' somewhere, huh?

148
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,860
You haven't even been makin'
Gohan-<i>chan</i> do a little bit of studyin',

149
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,410
and now you're feelin'
guilty and won't come out, huh?

150
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,740
Goku-<i>sa</i>?

151
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,960
Cell, is it?!

152
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,350
M-Mother...

153
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,520
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

154
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,340
Gohan... Gohan... Gohan!

155
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,800
What's wrong? Get a hold of yourself!

156
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:45,470
Mother! Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

157
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,270
Mother! Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

158
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,690
Did you have some kind of bad dream?

159
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,190
Dream?

160
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,530
It's down quite a bit.

161
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,160
You had an incredibly high fever,

162
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,370
and for the last two days,
you've done nothing but sleep!

163
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,370
Sorry.

164
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,790
It ain't something to apologize for.

165
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,290
Lately we've had nothing
but continuous harsh training,

166
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,670
so it couldn't be helped.

167
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,960
Okay, get some more sleep now.

168
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,340
And then, once I get up,
there's more training, right?

169
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,050
Of course there is!
Training is strict business!

170
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,180
You don't like it?

171
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,390
Don't be silly.

172
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,720
This time for sure,

173
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,350
I have to protect Mother and
Piccolo-<i>san</i> from that Cell guy...

174
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,580
Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen of the world.

175
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,920
Now, for just a moment,

176
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,920
I have decided to intrude into your television.

177
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,350
As it happens, I have brought wonderful
news to you ladies and gentlemen,

178
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,930
as you enjoy living your lives in peace.

179
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,730
News that will allow you to live out
your days filled with even more fun,

180
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,270
and even more thrills.

181
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,570
My name is Cell.

182
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,910
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm certain you are well aware

183
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,080
of the incidents where many people have
been wiped out by a monster every day.

184
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,410
I am that monster, having evolved and transformed.

185
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:44,970
For contributing so much life
energy to me then, I thank you.

186
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:50,890
You may be at ease. I no longer
have the need for such life energy.

187
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,890
I have decided to hold a martial
arts tournament, called the Cell Games.

188
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,980
The location will be due northwest
of the metropolis, at 28-KS-5.

189
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,230
I have prepared a ring there.

190
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,570
It will be different from the Tenkaichi Tournament,

191
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,570
in that if the warriors representing you,
ladies and gentlemen, are to lose,

192
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,580
then the next warrior will take their place.

193
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,910
This gives you the advantage.
Even as great as I am,

194
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:17,960
if I go through too many matches,
I may become tired, after all.

195
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,970
The rules will be just about the
same as in the Tenkaichi Tournament.

196
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:33,350
If you concede, or if any part of your
body touches outside the ring, you lose.

197
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,270
And, although it is my intent to hold back,

198
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,940
if you are killed, it too constitutes a loss.

199
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,940
In the event that all representative
warriors are defeated by me...

200
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,320
What?

201
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,870
...I have decided to kill
every last person in the world.

202
00:19:53,910 --> 00:20:01,710
I will gaze upon the looks of terror on your faces,
acting thoroughly, sparing not a single one of you.

203
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,890
That rotten Cell!

204
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,140
And with that, I would like many of you

205
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,020
who are sure of your strength to come participate.

206
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,030
If you don't want things to end up like this, that is.

207
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,790
And so, I will be looking forward to this.

208
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,880
T-That guy is despicable!

209
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,420
H-He said he would kill
every person in the world!

210
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,340
What power! I was too hopeful,

211
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,180
thinking that we wouldn't
get killed because of the rules.

212
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,770
Yamucha-<i>sama</i>!

213
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,730
Who could possibly fight against a guy like that?

214
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,690
Even Vegeta and Trunks
were no good against him!

215
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,730
And as for Goku...

216
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,280
Are you going somewhere, Vegeta?

217
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,540
I don't care how many Earthlings may die,

218
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,870
but I won't be content if I don't kill that scumbag.

219
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,290
I'll go as well!

220
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,300
Trunks, before you go, I'll cut your hair for you.

221
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,470
It must be a nuisance, right?

222
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,090
Thank you for your trouble.

223
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:47,900
