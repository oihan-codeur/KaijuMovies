<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:55,225
<i>Goku still has not recovered</i>
<i>from his heart disease.</i>

17
00:01:55,265 --> 00:02:01,425
<i>Additionally, the Artificial</i>
<i>Humans seek Goku's life.</i>

18
00:02:14,345 --> 00:02:20,285
<i>However, there is an absolute</i>
<i>terror, even greater than this crisis!</i>

19
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:27,985
<i>The monster from the future</i>

20
00:02:28,025 --> 00:02:32,835
<i>has sucked out the life's</i>
<i>essence of one person after another!</i>

21
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:47,805
<i>In order to oppose him,</i>
<i>Piccolo merges with Kami-</i>sama,

22
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:52,575
<i>becoming a reborn Namekian</i>
<i>warrior with enormous power!</i>

23
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:56,645
<i>A fierce battle has already begun between them!</i>

24
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:27,715
<i>"A Life Form of Evil and Destruction!!</i>
<i>His Name Is Artificial Human Cell."</i>

25
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:50,535
<i>Ka...</i>

26
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:52,505
<i>me...</i>

27
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:56,915
<i>T-That stance! It can't be...!</i>

28
00:03:56,955 --> 00:04:00,855
<i>ha...</i>

29
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:05,015
<i>me...</i>

30
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,055
<i>How can this be?</i>

31
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:11,425
<i>Ha!!</i>

32
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:13,865
<i>It's the real thing!</i>

33
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:35,455
Your life is mine!

34
00:04:49,405 --> 00:04:52,465
I struck your arm, did I?
The outcome is still the same.

35
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:56,345
I will take your powerful life's essence from you!

36
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:12,055
Still, who could it be that
Piccolo is fighting now, anyhow?

37
00:05:12,095 --> 00:05:16,295
I don't think there's any
mistaking that it's the monster

38
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:18,595
that hatched after riding
back in my time machine.

39
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:21,995
Why do you suppose that
thing has Goku, Piccolo, Vegeta,

40
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:25,995
not to mention Freeza and his father's <i>ki</i>?

41
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:29,005
Why indeed.

42
00:05:29,045 --> 00:05:33,275
Damn! Just what exactly is going on?!

43
00:05:56,405 --> 00:06:00,495
Goku<i>-sa</i> is gettin' just about over it, huh?

44
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,645
Isn't that great, Mother?

45
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,005
G-Goku<i>-sa</i>?

46
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:08,415
Father!

47
00:06:17,495 --> 00:06:18,615
Huh?

48
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:21,025
He's gone back to sleep.

49
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:23,625
But he should be opening his eyes soon, right?

50
00:06:23,665 --> 00:06:25,625
A-yep!

51
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,435
I'm going to go tell Oolong<i>-san</i> and the others!

52
00:06:29,675 --> 00:06:31,435
Guys!

53
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:40,405
We have received word that currently,

54
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:42,005
the armed forces at Metro West have at length...

55
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:46,415
...commenced an emergency
mobilization toward Gingertown.

56
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:48,015
Armed forces?

57
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:50,055
In consideration of the safety
of the neighboring districts,

58
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:54,615
it is hoped this will allow
area citizens some peace of mind.

59
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,865
It would be nice if there
were no further casualties...

60
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:03,035
This information just in:

61
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:06,335
Please watch, as we have
images of one of the tank divisions

62
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,465
as they head toward the scene.

63
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:13,475
The images, please.

64
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:21,045
Currently, we seem to be having
trouble connecting with our remote unit...

65
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:24,085
Ah, they're waiting?
We appear to be connected.

66
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:19,435
T-That's him!

67
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:21,605
Hey, you up there!

68
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:25,445
You are completely surrounded!

69
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:29,445
Surrender yourself,
without any useless resistance!

70
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:37,865
You dare interrupt my meal?!

71
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:54,845
Dammit! Attack! Attack!

72
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:29,445
We got him!

73
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,575
He's still alive!

74
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:32,575
What?!

75
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:36,015
You miserable cockroaches!

76
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,415
Dammit!

77
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:40,425
Fire missiles!

78
00:10:06,415 --> 00:10:09,545
That was quite the annoyance.

79
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:14,285
So then, shall we continue the meal?

80
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,845
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

81
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,155
Something the matter, No. 16?

82
00:11:58,195 --> 00:12:01,365
There's been a fluctuation in
that power reading from before.

83
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:03,565
It appears a conclusion has been reached.

84
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:04,935
From before?

85
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:08,165
You mean that one with the
power that rivaled our own?

86
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:10,575
That's right.

87
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,575
Are you still saying that?

88
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:16,745
Your power radar is malfunctioning, No. 16.

89
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:21,545
There's no way in the world a
power level that rivals ours could exist.

90
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:23,385
Don't make me say it again.

91
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:40,765
You were lucky to get away.

92
00:12:40,805 --> 00:12:46,805
But not having use of one arm, it
seems the advantage has been reversed!

93
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:53,785
Certainly true.

94
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:58,585
My balance is thrown off like this,
making it quite difficult for me.

95
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:02,995
Unfortunately, it would seem you have won!

96
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:08,125
Not even you can help
admitting when you're beaten!

97
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:12,335
Rejoice! Once I absorb the
magnitude of your life's essence,

98
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,565
I will have drawn much
closer to my perfect form.

99
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,135
Perfect form?!

100
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:22,975
You will be of great
service to me. Aren't you glad?!

101
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:26,145
Before I am to be absorbed by you,
you have to tell me something!

102
00:13:26,185 --> 00:13:29,985
What in the hell are you?!

103
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:33,355
Why is it you have Son Goku,
Freeza and everyone's <i>ki,</i>

104
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:36,835
and are even able to
perform the <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>?!

105
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,265
Very well.

106
00:13:45,305 --> 00:13:48,505
You're going to die anyway. I'll tell you.

107
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:55,875
My name is Cell. I am an Artificial Human.

108
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:58,775
A-Artificial Human?!

109
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:03,985
I was born of the computer used by Doctor Gero.

110
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,155
Doctor Gero again!

111
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:07,955
A long time ago,

112
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:11,555
Doctor Gero began collecting
the cells of the greatest warriors,

113
00:14:11,595 --> 00:14:16,165
to research how he could synthesize
an Artificial Human from those cells.

114
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,165
However, because it was taking too much time,

115
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:20,835
he gave up on it partway through.

116
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:41,085
But the computer continued its operation.

117
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:02,985
Piccolo...

118
00:15:07,225 --> 00:15:09,815
Son Goku...

119
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:15,755
and Vegeta's cells were collected at the battle

120
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:20,395
when Vegeta first came to Earth.

121
00:15:38,615 --> 00:15:41,385
Hmph, Goku from that period of time, huh?

122
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:46,785
That explains why your <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>
before wasn't all that great.

123
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:48,815
Further,

124
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:54,165
we had the good fortune of
obtaining Freeza and his father's cells

125
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:58,365
when they came to Earth.

126
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:28,795
We could have taken the
cells of that guy Trunks as well,

127
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:34,635
but there was already enough from the Saiyans.

128
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:38,935
H-How did you collect the cells?!

129
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:43,545
There wasn't anyone
suspicious there at the time!

130
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,145
You should have heard this from Gero,

131
00:16:46,185 --> 00:16:50,885
how all your actions have
been examined via a spy robot.

132
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,985
There is a small robot, similar to myself.

133
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:57,495
No one is likely to have noticed it.
That's what took the cells.

134
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:59,555
Take a good look!

135
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:05,405
It's here even now, relaying the data
of our situation back to the computer.

136
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:11,405
It probably wants to take your cells as well!

137
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:15,845
You bastard!

138
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:23,755
It's too late to destroy it now!

139
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:26,355
The necessary cells have already been collected,

140
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,155
and the experiment has begun!

141
00:17:28,195 --> 00:17:33,555
Indeed, it will be twenty-four years
from now when I will be completed.

142
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:37,165
Impossible! Doctor Gero's
laboratory has been destroyed!

143
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:42,605
There is still a room beneath the
laboratory where the computer is!

144
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,805
So that's it.

145
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:48,905
Once you came to this era,

146
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:52,375
why has it taken you three years to
change from an egg to the way you are?

147
00:17:52,415 --> 00:17:54,415
Once I return myself to an egg,

148
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:57,915
I require three years
underground to mature again.

149
00:17:57,955 --> 00:18:00,955
That's how much time it takes.

150
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:02,525
That's all I have to say.

151
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:05,755
It's about time you let me absorb you.

152
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,965
One last question!

153
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,135
For what reason did you go to the
trouble of coming here from the future?

154
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,865
In order for me to become my perfect form,

155
00:18:13,905 --> 00:18:18,135
the absorption of human
essences alone is not enough!

156
00:18:18,175 --> 00:18:24,575
It is necessary for me to merge with
two essential specialized life forms.

157
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:29,815
The computer has told me that
those two specialized life forms were...

158
00:18:33,025 --> 00:18:38,795
...the Artificial Humans that Doctor
Gero had created, No. 17 and No. 18!

159
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:39,825
<i>What?!</i>

160
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:01,585
However, in the future,
where I was, for some reason–

161
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:07,155
perhaps they were defeated by that Trunks guy,
I don't know–No. 17 and No. 18 weren't around.

162
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:11,825
But luckily for me, Trunks had his time machine!

163
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,615
After killing Trunks,

164
00:19:31,655 --> 00:19:38,645
I used the time machine to come to
this era in search of No. 17 and No. 18.

165
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:25,065
W-Why did you choose this era?!

166
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:30,575
Well now, Trunks' time machine
was already set for this era.

167
00:20:30,615 --> 00:20:34,075
All I did was push the switch.

168
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:35,775
<i>So that's it.</i>

169
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:40,785
<i>Trunks must have set the time</i>
<i>machine so he could come tell us</i>

170
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:44,085
<i>that somehow he had</i>
<i>destroyed the Artificial Humans.</i>

171
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,455
<i>A-And then he came along...</i>

172
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,925
The computer also told me this...

173
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,955
Once I become my perfect form,

174
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:54,565
I will have a terrible power,
far beyond imagination,

175
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:56,765
in the palm of my hand!

176
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,135
For what reason?!

177
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:02,765
Why is it you seek to have
that much overwhelming power?!

178
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:03,935
What reason?

179
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:05,905
You ask such a nonsensical thing!

180
00:21:05,945 --> 00:21:11,075
The computer had been
input to create a strong being,

181
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:15,115
one to the very limits of its consideration!

182
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:18,955
Or for that matter, it may be what
the blood of the Saiyans, Freeza,

183
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:23,925
and Piccolo that flows within me seeks!

184
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,095
I get it.

185
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:28,295
So then, are you satisfied?

186
00:21:28,335 --> 00:21:30,765
My gratitude.

187
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:33,795
Thanks to you, all of the
mysteries have now been solved.

188
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:43,975
You've been quite informative!

189
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:48,485
Y-You did all that to get me to talk?!

190
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,485
I will not allow you to
become this perfect form of yours!

191
00:21:51,525 --> 00:21:54,285
For you to have inherited my blood

192
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:58,825
and not realize that I could
re-grow my arm makes you an idiot!

193
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:03,525
<i>The situation has reversed!</i>

194
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:10,005
<i>However, the beast's depth</i>
<i>of power is still unmeasured.</i>

195
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:18,005
<i>Z Warriors, do not allow the</i>
<i>monster Cell his perfect form!</i>

196
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:47,005
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

197
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:52,845
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

198
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:55,215
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

199
00:22:58,695 --> 00:23:03,725
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

200
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:10,225
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

201
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:14,335
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

202
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,835
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

203
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:20,475
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

204
00:23:22,215 --> 00:23:27,985
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

205
00:23:30,225 --> 00:23:32,085
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

206
00:23:32,125 --> 00:23:33,885
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

207
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:37,925
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

208
00:23:37,965 --> 00:23:43,595
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

209
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:45,765
<i>So sorry.</i>

210
00:23:45,805 --> 00:23:50,905
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

211
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:58,915
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

212
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:11,255
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

213
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:14,565
<i>Cell is having a free-for-all while I'm asleep.</i>

214
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:16,395
<i>Once I've recovered, I'll beat him senseless!</i>

215
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:20,265
<i>I will acquire No. 17 and</i>
<i>No. 18, no matter what!</i>

216
00:24:20,305 --> 00:24:24,835
<i>I will achieve my perfect form,</i>
<i>and gain the ultimate power!</i>

217
00:24:24,875 --> 00:24:26,905
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

218
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:30,915
<i>"Piccolo's Grievous Mistake!</i>
<i>Cell Turned Loose on the City!"</i>

219
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:33,155
<i>We have to catch him, quickly!</i>

220
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,285
"Next time"
"Piccolo's Grievous Mistake!
Cell Turned Loose on the City!"
