00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,290
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,050
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,680
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,930
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,690
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,280
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,200
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,030
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,620
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,620
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,620
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:20,170
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,050
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,640
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,640
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,980
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,190
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,820
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,120
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:57,250
<i>Vegeta stalled for time so that Goku could</i>
<i>store up enough ki to defeat Majin Boo.</i>

24
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,470
<i>However, there was nothing Vegeta</i>
<i>could do before Boo's spectacular strength.</i>

25
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,940
<i>But then...</i>

26
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,860
<i>...the gentle Boo, who had been</i>
<i>absorbed by Boo, was revived.</i>

27
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,660
I hate you! Don't you pick on Satan!

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,340
Aren't you done yet?! Aren't
you done gathering up your <i>ki</i>?!

29
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,510
M-My power... My power is d-dropping off!

30
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,400
<i>But what's this? After storing up his ki,</i>

31
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,230
<i>Goku suddenly returned to</i>
<i>normal from being Super Saiyan!</i>

32
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,450
<i>"Vegeta's Secret Plan!!</i>
<i>Polunga and the Two Wishes."</i>

33
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,650
H-Hang in there, Boo!

34
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,260
Y-You stupid bastard! You let all
that pain I went through go to waste!

35
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,470
What do you think you're doing, Kakarrot?!

36
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,310
S-Sorry, Vegeta...

37
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,480
D-Damn it all! It was never
any problem when I was dead...

38
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:26,280
It appears that being Super Saiyan 3 in a
living body eats up quite a bit of <i>ki</i> after all...

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,490
We've had it. We really have had it.

40
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,650
Boo!

41
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,910
You bastard! How dare you do that to Boo!

42
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:22,000
Let go! Let go of him!
You dirty runt! Come on, let go!

43
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,010
You turn into choco!!

44
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,550
Th-This is bad. He's going
to be done in like that.

45
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,450
Kaioshins! Dende! Can you hear me?!

46
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,420
You've got to be watching
what's happening on that ball, right?!

47
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,500
Can you hear me? If you can
hear my voice, then answer me!

48
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,220
Yeah, we hear you...

49
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,600
All right! Now then, go immediately
to the restored Planet Namek

50
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,890
and scrounge up the Dragon Balls!

51
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,270
U-Um, how exactly are...

52
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,900
Stop nattering and get on with it!

53
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,440
We're running out of time!

54
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,320
Th-The Dragon Balls, huh?

55
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,450
I'm sure Vegeta-<i>san</i> has
some sort of idea! Let's go!

56
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,290
Still, those things, you know...

57
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:28,830
This is no time for you to be so particular!

58
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,300
How is it wrong to use
them for something legitimate?

59
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,130
I-I get it. I get it!

60
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,550
Let's go! To Planet Namek!

61
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:53,190
It would seem they've gone.

62
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,570
V-Vegeta, what are you doing?

63
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,870
It's still too soon to be using the Dragon Balls.

64
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,660
Kakarrot, how many times have
you saved the Earth up to now?

65
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,290
What's this, all of a sudden?

66
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,460
I asked you how many times you've saved it!

67
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,470
Let's see, how many times has it been?

68
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,510
It's time to let the folks on Earth
take the responsibility for a change.

69
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,870
So this is Planet Namek?

70
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,580
Y-Yes... It's supposed to be...

71
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,590
It is Planet Namek! There's no
doubt about it! H-However, it's...

72
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,680
What do you think, Dende?

73
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,050
It's just the way it used
to be, even on this planet!

74
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,900
–Welcome back!
–You've certainly grown up!

75
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,230
Y-You guys!

76
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,280
It has been so long! Elder-<i>sama,</i>
I'm so glad you're looking well!

77
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,290
Dende, you're looking good too. And
you've become quite Kami-<i>sama</i>-like!

78
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,870
N-Not at all!

79
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,920
I'm still very inexperienced, and
there is much I still have to study.

80
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,630
I'm sorry to interrupt your touching
reunion, but there isn't a moment to lose.

81
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,970
Th-That's right! Elder-<i>sama,</i>
I have a favor to ask!

82
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,970
Would you please gather the
Dragon Balls right away for me?

83
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:52,980
We need the power of Polunga!

84
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,650
The Dragon Balls, you say?

85
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:04,110
Has something happened to the Dragon Balls?

86
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:36,440
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, we know the
entire situation. Now, let us hurry!

87
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,610
Yeah. So you've already gathered them?

88
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,440
Thank you very much!

89
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,610
Vegeta-<i>san...</i>

90
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,950
Vegeta-<i>san</i>, can you hear me?!

91
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,160
Vegeta-<i>san</i>! All seven Dragon Balls
have already been gathered!

92
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,880
Dende?

93
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,590
Summon Planet Namek's Polunga immediately!

94
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,470
There are two wishes I want granted.

95
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,020
First, I want the Earth that has been
destroyed returned to the way it was!

96
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,980
Next, I want everyone who has died since
the day of that Tenkaichi Tournament,

97
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:22,520
except for the really bad ones, to
be brought back to life! Those two!

98
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,040
R-Right now? Those wishes?

99
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,410
That's right! Right now!

100
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,420
B-But, isn't that...

101
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,550
Dende, it looks like
Vegeta has some sort of idea.

102
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,550
Sorry to trouble you,
but could you just do it?

103
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:50,390
Y-Yes, understood!
So, what about the third wish?

104
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,560
After those first two, anything's fine!
Do whatever you want!

105
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,020
Vegeta, about that second wish...

106
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,690
Wouldn't it have been easier

107
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,690
to just ask for everyone who had been
killed by Boo to be brought back to life?

108
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,530
Hmph, idiot! If I'd done that,

109
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,530
then even Babidi and Dabura
would be brought back to life.

110
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,750
Besides, that way, the group that
I killed at the tournament grounds

111
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,710
would not be returned to life.

112
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,170
You sure thought this out, huh?

113
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,470
That won't work, Vegeta-<i>san</i>!
Come to think of it,

114
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:32,470
with Polunga here, we can only
bring people back to life one at a time!

115
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,470
W-What?!

116
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,970
N-Now that he mentions it, that's right, Vegeta!

117
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,670
<i>W-What do we do?</i>

118
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,630
<i>We can't bring everyone</i>
<i>on Earth back to life like this!</i>

119
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,670
Such worries are unnecessary!

120
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:16,640
After the incident with Freeza,
I had Polunga's wishes powered-up!

121
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,480
Does that mean he can
do any number of people?!

122
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,650
That's right.

123
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,230
Th-These guys are making a
mess of the natural order of things!

124
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,670
Vegeta-<i>san</i>! They said it would be all right!

125
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:47,210
Great. Now, get started!

126
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:56,600
Come forth, Polunga!

127
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,150
W-What the...?

128
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,700
Th-This is... Polunga?

129
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:09,080
So then, you may speak your wishes!
I shall grant thee any three wishes.

130
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,640
Okay, tell him the wishes! Do you
still remember the Namek language?

131
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,930
Yes.

132
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:34,070
Polunga! The faraway planet Earth has
been destroyed, and has disappeared.

133
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,610
Please, if you would, return
it back to the way it was!

134
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,460
Okay! That is a simple task.

135
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,130
E-Earth really has returned back to...

136
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:35,050
We did it! We did it!

137
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,630
I have granted your
first wish. Now, the next one.

138
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,840
You may speak your second wish.

139
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,600
Let's see, how should I say this...?

140
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,990
Um, please bring back to
life everyone who has died

141
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:08,290
since Madoshi Babidi arrived on Earth,
leaving out the really bad people.

142
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,430
Understood. However, thou must briefly wait.

143
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,520
Their numbers are many,
and it will be demanding.

144
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,060
Right!

145
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,770
W-What's this? Is he capable of even this?

146
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,490
Why, you runt! Why, you...! Why, you...! Let go!

147
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,920
Come on!

148
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,340
Come on! Let go, you stupid runt! Why, you...!

149
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,190
Satan!

150
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,670
This is precarious! Have you noticed, Kakarrot?

151
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,550
Yeah.

152
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,050
That chubby Boo is beginning to lose power.

153
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:28,590
With them both being
Boos, he's taking damage.

154
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,850
Aren't you done yet, Dende?!
Haven't those wishes been granted yet?!

155
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,530
What a pest! Stop squawking at us!

156
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,030
Polunga is going to a lot of trouble!

157
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:55,450
Thank you for waiting.
Your second wish has been granted.

158
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,580
He did it! He's done it!

159
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,050
Both the Earth and everyone on it have
been brought back to life, Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

160
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:06,420
Is that right?

161
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,630
W-What is it you're planning to do?

162
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:15,310
Vegeta, the ring over your head is gone!

163
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,740
This sure is great for you!
You ain't thought of as being really bad!

164
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,580
Th-Then, I wasn't killed by Boo?

165
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,420
Goodness! What in the world does this mean?

166
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,340
–But I was sure...
–So then, we didn't die?

167
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,470
Huh?

168
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,440
What's going on here?

169
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,160
I'm certain I was turned into chocolate,

170
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,370
and then I was eaten by Majin Boo,
and then I went to Heaven...!

171
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,420
I get it, Vegeta!

172
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,760
You wanted to bring
Gohan and Gotenks back to life

173
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,430
so we can have them fight too, right?

174
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,840
Wrong!

175
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,440
We're starting! Get ready!

176
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,900
Ready? For what?

177
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,450
Get ready to make a <i>Genki Dama</i>!

178
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,660
A-A <i>Genki Dama</i>? A <i>Genki Dama</i>?!

179
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:14,050
<i>W-What's this?! Vegeta's secret</i>
<i>plan was to use a Genki Dama!</i>

180
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,680
<i>Come on, everyone who has been resurrected!</i>

181
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,640
<i>Share your Genki with Goku,</i>
<i>and then, defeat Majin Boo!</i>

182
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,690
A <i>Genki Dama</i>, you say?

183
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,780
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

184
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,370
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

185
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,930
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

186
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:02,060
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

187
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:09,020
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

188
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:14,400
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

189
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,280
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

190
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:27,380
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

191
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,920
<i>Even now?</i>

192
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,550
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

193
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,930
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

194
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:48,440
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

195
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:58,450
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

196
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,090
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

197
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,590
<i>I'm impressed, Vegeta.</i>

198
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,640
<i>If I can collect a bunch of earth's</i>
<i>Genki energy, we just might win.</i>

199
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,970
<i>Listen up, earthlings!</i>

200
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,430
<i>We're collecting your energy to defeat Boo!</i>

201
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,770
<i>Unless you want to die again,</i>
<i>raise your hands, now!</i>

202
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,600
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

203
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,190
<i>"A Last Hope!!</i>
<i>We'll Make a Huge Genki Dama."</i>

204
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,650
<i>No, Vegeta-san, you can't</i>
<i>ask them in such a rude manner!</i>

205
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,990
"Next time"
"A Last Hope!!
We'll Make a Huge Genki Dama"
