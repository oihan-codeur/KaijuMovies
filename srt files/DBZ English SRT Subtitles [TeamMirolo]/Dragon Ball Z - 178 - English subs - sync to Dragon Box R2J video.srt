<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:24,540
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,830
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:36,550
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,140
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:52,020
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

7
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,520
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:04,530
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:08,000
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,080
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,500
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:26,430
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,020
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,900
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,820
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,620
<i>Ka... me...</i>

17
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,500
<i>ha... me...</i>

18
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,630
<i>Ha</i>!!

19
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,720
<i>The clash between Goku</i>
<i>and Cell had finally begun.</i>

20
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,040
<i>The intense exchange between them</i>
<i>left those in the audience dumbfounded.</i>

21
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,720
<i>Son Goku, huh?</i>

22
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,590
<i>Indeed, he is skilled at fighting.</i>

23
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,390
<i>He's one or two paces</i>
<i>removed from the others.</i>

24
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,980
<i>This guy looks to be unimaginably strong.</i>

25
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,310
<i>If I get even the slightest bit careless,</i>

26
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,940
<i>I'll be finished off in an instant!</i>

27
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,820
<i>The look in Goku-san's eye has changed!</i>

28
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,330
<i>Goku is about to release his true power.</i>

29
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,960
<i>An unyielding full-power</i>
<i>battle is about to get underway!</i>

30
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,350
<i>"Direct Hit to Earth!!</i>
<i>Cell's Extra-Large Kamehame-Ha."</i>

31
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,720
Incredible!

32
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,180
It's unbelievable!

33
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,150
What amazing power...!

34
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,360
I-Impossible!

35
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,230
Y-You mean his <i>ki</i> is still rising?

36
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,150
W-What could that have possibly been just now?

37
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,360
Just at the moment when it
appeared that the unnamed warrior's

38
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,490
entire body lit up, it was
almost as if something burst...

39
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,860
What could it mean?

40
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,750
Even now, it appears that
there is some sort of amber glow

41
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,250
rising around the vicinity
of the unnamed warrior.

42
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,460
I-It's a trick.

43
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,510
Father...

44
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,740
Th-The same sort of thing
just happened with Cell...

45
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,710
Hmph! These petty
tricks appear to be in fashion.

46
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,580
Y-Yes, of course.

47
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,210
If those weren't tricks, what else could they be?

48
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,380
Here it comes...

49
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,090
Those two are both going to hit
each other at full power, right away...

50
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,400
Now?

51
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,400
Yeah.

52
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,010
Very good, Son Goku. This is what I was after.

53
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,560
Battles get interesting when the
opponents' abilities are somewhat close.

54
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,610
Yeah. I think so too.

55
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,400
Th-This is now his...

56
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,410
Kakarrot's true power...?!

57
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,990
I-Incredible! Goku-<i>san</i> is
extraordinarily incredible, all right!

58
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,790
Th-That really is an awesome <i>ki</i>!
He's certainly been working at it!

59
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,090
<i>I wonder why everyone is so surprised.</i>

60
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,000
<i>Sure, this is incredible, but still...</i>

61
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,080
H-Hey, did you get all that?

62
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,210
Don't be preposterous!

63
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,710
I can't follow anything as fast as that!

64
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,000
Y-Yeah, I suppose not...

65
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,760
That battle was also at remarkable
speed, wasn't it, Mister Satan?

66
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,890
It wasn't too bad, huh?

67
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,290
This will be entertaining, Son Goku!

68
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,130
W-What...?

69
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,090
Is that...?

70
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,180
I-It couldn't be...!

71
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,230
<i>Shishin no ken</i>!!

72
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:14,410
Geez! You mean Cell has
also taken Tenshinhan's cells?!

73
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,330
Why, you...!

74
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,200
Mister Satan, could you explain...?

75
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,750
You're already going to
the finishing moves, huh?

76
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,400
But then, this technique
ain't going to work on me.

77
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,910
Is that so?!

78
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,270
What the hell am I looking at?

79
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,690
This technique had the drawback
of having your power cut in half

80
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,030
by turning into four individuals!

81
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:15,620
But his speed and technique are the same as
when he was a single individual, aren't they?

82
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,030
No. I hate to admit it,

83
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,040
but Cell has made this technique
even more his own than I did!

84
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,580
Then again, Son Goku hasn't fallen behind.

85
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,900
Son Goku, are you somewhat
aware of my power now?

86
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,110
Yeah. Not bad.

87
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,950
But then, my perfect, flawless
power is still more than just this.

88
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,000
I-Is that...?

89
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,710
Sheesh, this time it's my technique, huh?

90
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,680
Take this!

91
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,440
I've been waiting for this.

92
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,580
For you four to split up, I mean!

93
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,670
H-He got him!

94
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,440
That's Goku-<i>san</i> for you!

95
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,610
Going after their time lag like that...

96
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:18,030
Hmph! Idiots!

97
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,570
Those are among the very
basics of the basics of fighting.

98
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:24,830
Never mind him, get a
load of Cell's dormant power.

99
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,910
Cell hasn't lost any <i>ki</i> at all!

100
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,460
Th-That can't be...!

101
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,750
Y-You're kidding, right?

102
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,360
<i>K-Kienzan</i> discs, huh?

103
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,620
–That <i>Kienzan</i> disc...!
–It's as if he's controlling it like a <i>Sokidan blas</i> t!

104
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,630
That's neither a <i>Kienzan</i> or a <i>Sokidan...</i>

105
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,590
That's the final technique that
Freeza used on Planet Namek.

106
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,720
Doctor Gero, you miserable fool!

107
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,100
What kind of monster have you brought forth?

108
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,760
Freeza's cells tell me that
you're planning to come up to me,

109
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,430
and at the last second,
knock me down. However...

110
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,020
I'm not falling...

111
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,770
for that trick!!

112
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,770
I took that into account as well!

113
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,040
You ain't going to beat me by
just using other people's techniques!

114
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,370
Borrowed knowledge doesn't go far, after all.

115
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,460
That might be true.

116
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,510
In that case, I'll make this the last one.

117
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,720
<i>He raised his ki to its maximum level!</i>
<i>What is he planning to do?!</i>

118
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,020
<i>Ka...</i>

119
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,690
<i>me...</i>

120
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,110
Stop! If you launch a <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>
in that raised state of power...!

121
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,740
<i>ha...</i>

122
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,700
<i>me...</i>

123
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,750
S-Stop!

124
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,710
<i>Ha</i>!!

125
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:29,590
Over here, Cell!

126
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,360
A-An explanation...?

127
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,010
How? That <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>
should surely have hit you.

128
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,680
Yeah, I couldn't have escaped it.

129
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,140
I get it.

130
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,850
You've suddenly appeared
and vanished before, as well.

131
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,940
Instantaneous Movement. I can do it!

132
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,030
Instantaneous Movement? I see.

133
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,860
That's a problematic technique, huh?

134
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,620
I want to ask something too.

135
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,620
If I hadn't jumped up into the sky,

136
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,830
would you have kept shooting
your <i>Kamehame-Ha</i> like that,

137
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,370
and destroyed the Earth?

138
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,040
Well, that's a good question.

139
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,290
But then, I knew that the only
thing you could do was jump up.

140
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:30,930
I see. It looks like you're pretty smart yourself.

141
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,430
Then again, I will say this:

142
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,770
I would think nothing of destroying the Earth.

143
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,350
It would just make things
less amusing for me, that's all!

144
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,850
And when it comes to speed,
I'm pretty sure of myself.

145
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,440
<i>Cell's speed is astonishing!</i>

146
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,560
<i>Does Goku have any chance of winning?</i>

147
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:48,840
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

148
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,680
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

149
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,050
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

150
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,560
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

151
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:12,070
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

152
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,160
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

153
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,660
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

154
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,280
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

155
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,830
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

156
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,920
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

157
