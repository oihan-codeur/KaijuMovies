<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,970
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,290
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,660
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:04,670
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,030
I-It's a Saiyan spaceship!

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,000
It's Vegeta. He's the only one it could be.

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,370
Dammit!

19
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:17,380
Freeza, you bastard! I won't
let you snatch them away from me!

20
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,550
What?!

21
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,190
W-Why is there another one coming?

22
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,830
<i>Planet Namek was everyone's star of hope.</i>

23
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,530
<i>However, now it had been</i>
<i>changed into a star of misfortune,</i>

24
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,570
<i>as it swirls with Freeza's rapacity.</i>

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,220
<i>"Vegeta's Ambition! I am the</i>
<i>Greatest Warrior in the Universe!!"</i>

26
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,400
This is bad... this is definitely bad...

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,770
There aren't supposed to be any other Saiyans.

28
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,740
W-Who could it be?

29
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,160
Now there are three more, yes?

30
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:47,370
Hold them with care, Dodoria<i>-san.</i>
It appears that Vegeta is after them, as well.

31
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:57,620
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, Kewie, who is
pursuing Vegeta, has just landed.

32
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,590
And as for those two large
power readings that appeared earlier,

33
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,530
they suddenly disappeared, and remain so.

34
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,760
We are searching the area
where the readings were located,

35
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,600
so we should soon
discover what their source was.

36
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,610
Well, the issue here is the
disposal of Vegeta, who has defied me.

37
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,610
In that case, you need not worry.

38
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,650
Kewie should now be heading
after Vegeta to deal with him.

39
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,190
Those two have always hated each other,
and their abilities are roughly the same.

40
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,930
In any event, Vegeta is not
likely to come away unscathed.

41
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,570
Vegeta, you're not getting away from me.

42
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,140
I've found you, Vegeta. I'm
under orders from Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

43
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,150
Are you reading me, Vegeta?!
Now I can kill you out in the open!

44
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:10,150
Don't make me laugh,
Kewie. You think you can kill me?

45
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:13,090
I'm waiting here for you, so get here fast.

46
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,560
What are you, blind?
Take a good look at your Scouter.

47
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,700
My battle power is clearly higher than yours!

48
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,240
We can't stay here, in any case, can we?

49
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,980
I'll leave the Dragon Balls up to you.

50
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,590
Okay, well, I'm going
back to Earth, so good luck.

51
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,560
Bulma<i>-san</i>, just a minute.

52
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,330
What should we do, Gohan?

53
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,110
S-Should we go back to Earth now, too?

54
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,250
After all, it looks like
we've got one more foe now,

55
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,280
and even if we do have the Dragon Radar...

56
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,050
Oh, I mean, I'm fine and all,

57
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:22,720
but it wouldn't be right if
anything were to happen to Gohan.

58
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,100
B-But Kuririn<i>-san</i>, if we do that,
then he'll get the Dragon Balls.

59
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,670
Well, if we yield the
Dragon Balls to him this time,

60
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,770
we could always use them next time.

61
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:41,550
That would be okay, as long as he
doesn't kill Shen Long, like Piccolo did before.

62
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,680
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, someone is coming!

63
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,490
I-Is it a Saiyan?

64
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,630
N-No, it's not Vegeta. This <i>ki</i> is weaker.

65
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,710
This should be the area
where the readings disappeared.

66
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,150
Must be Namekians.

67
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,150
Who is it?

68
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,090
Probably Namekians.

69
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,690
T-They're not Namekians!

70
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,700
Hmm? W-What is that?

71
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,670
Those aren't Namekians! Who are they?!

72
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:46,670
That doesn't matter. We were ordered
to just kill anyone who was on this planet.

73
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,520
Look at what they're wearing!

74
00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:00,020
Those are just like what the Saiyans
were wearing. Yet... they're not Saiyans.

75
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,530
I haven't a clue what it means,
but I've got a bad feeling about this.

76
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:11,060
R-Right... Any way you look at
them, those are not friendly faces...

77
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,510
Gohan, build up your <i>ki</i> while
keeping your presence masked.

78
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,810
Right.

79
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,220
Do you see that? These guys are
common trash, with barely any battle power!

80
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,860
They're just tourists.

81
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,790
We won't get to have any fun if they run away.

82
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,730
Take care of their spaceship first.

83
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,740
All right.

84
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,010
Oh, crap! Our spaceship!

85
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,440
These guys are so unlucky to
have come here at a time like this.

86
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,190
Gohan, release your <i>ki.</i>
These guys aren't all that tough!

87
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,050
Hey, did you hear that?

88
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,000
Not all that tough? Does he mean us?

89
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,000
W-What kind of battle power ratings are these?!

90
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,510
Let's do it!

91
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,850
Right!

92
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,830
Hey, nice, nice!

93
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,870
That was not nice!

94
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,040
What are we going to do about that?

95
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,890
Is something the matter, Zarbon<i>-san</i>?

96
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,890
Yes, Freeza<i>-sama.</i> It is about
the search that was ordered earlier.

97
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,660
It would seem that
they are no ordinary people.

98
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,870
Their battle powers rose momentarily,

99
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:28,870
then once they had defeated our pair
of scouts, their readings disappeared again.

100
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,480
Ho, that is curious. It does
not appear to be Vegeta, either.

101
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,250
Correct, the readings are different from Vegeta.

102
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,480
Their battle powers were both around 1,500.

103
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,090
1,500, you say? We could leave
them alone, and nothing would come of it,

104
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,430
but their attitude does not
seem to be very good, does it?

105
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,920
The next time they are found, eliminate them.

106
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,400
<i>All right, just a little more...</i>

107
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,960
Goku<i>-sa...</i>

108
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,730
Chichi...

109
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:00,170
What are you doin'?

110
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,770
Oh, you know, I was bored, so...

111
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:10,610
Really... How about you realize
somewhat that you were seriously injured?

112
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:14,950
If you don't lie there quietly,
you're goin' to open your wounds up again.

113
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,180
Ow! Yow-ow-ow-ow! Don't be so rough!

114
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:22,780
Yow-ow-ow-ow! That hurts! That hurts!

115
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,590
Never mind that, I wonder if Gohan<i>-chan</i> is okay.

116
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:31,590
I hope he's washin' his
hair, and usin' that rinse.

117
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,770
His hair is so shiny and all,
so he has to look after his cuticles.

118
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,100
Is he usin' his hair dryer?

119
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:43,700
His hair dries out so fast,
and he has to take care of it right...

120
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,140
<i>Gohan...</i>

121
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,520
It's hopeless! It's all over!
We'll never get back to Earth now!

122
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,530
Uh, Bulma<i>-san</i>, for the time
being, let's get away from here.

123
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,530
It's dangerous here. Someone
even stronger might come along.

124
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,840
That's right. Those many <i>ki</i>
that we sensed weren't Namekians,

125
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,680
but appear to be friends of Vegeta,
so we need to go hide somewhere.

126
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,550
Things will work out somehow.

127
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,180
I'm sure the Namekians
will repair the spaceship for us.

128
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,750
How nice that you can be so optimistic!

129
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,930
Bulma<i>-san...</i>

130
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,740
Hmph, you're finally here, are you?

131
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,710
You imbecile.

132
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,420
It looks like the time has come

133
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,690
when we can finally settle things
between us as fellow rivals, huh?

134
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,060
But it looks like you've let yourself go.

135
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,130
You've got no chance of
beating me with that battle power.

136
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,940
Fellow rivals, you say?

137
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,140
Well, let me show you a little something.

138
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,710
When I was on Earth, I learned
something interesting from them.

139
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,120
What, how to run away quickly?

140
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,090
How to control my battle power!

141
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,860
H-How to control your battle power?

142
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,940
Take a good look at my battle
power rating on your Scouter!

143
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,940
I-Impossible! You and I have
always been evenly matched!

144
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:04,510
You idiot! I have been fighting
in actual combat constantly.

145
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,950
The battle on Earth was
such that it nearly killed me.

146
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,790
Did you think I would
remain equal with you forever,

147
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,820
as you just sat around
in comfort at Freeza's place?!

148
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:19,870
19,000... 20,000... 21,000... 22,000!

149
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,500
What happened, Zarbon?

150
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,510
I-I think it was a malfunction,

151
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,140
but the rating on my Scouter, which was
set on Vegeta, had just risen above 22,000...

152
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,850
22,000, you say?

153
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,550
That really was a malfunction.
Your Scouter is an older model, after all.

154
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,530
I'll find out his true rating for you on mine.

155
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,060
What's his rating?

156
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,230
T-This is absurd... Could my
newer model be malfunctioning, too?

157
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,870
He's gone up to 24,000...

158
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:02,470
If he's at 24,000... Are you saying that
his battle power is even higher than ours?

159
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,040
I-It couldn't be. His battle
power would just barely reach 18,000.

160
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,250
It is nothing to be surprised about.

161
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,920
Vegeta has been fighting
on the front lines, you see.

162
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,090
He probably came upon
some sort of new skill on Earth.

163
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:21,090
But...

164
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:26,860
It is only 24,000. If the
two of you fight together,

165
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,700
it is a rating that you can
sufficiently beat, is it not?

166
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,210
Vegeta probably wants to obtain
eternal life with the Dragon Balls,

167
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,880
the same wish that I have.

168
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,420
Unless he does so, there is no way
that he can prevail against me, you see.

169
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,850
Vegeta never has been respectful toward me.

170
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,060
He went to Earth without my orders,

171
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,900
and he even appears to be
after my position for his own.

172
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,470
Though I must say, this is brash of him.

173
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,240
To think that he would come
out in open treason against me...

174
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:19,710
W-Wait, Vegeta! I just had a great idea!
Let me work with you. I can lend you a hand.

175
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:26,050
I-I didn't like Freeza<i>-sa–</i>
I mean, Freeza before this, either.

176
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,460
T-That doesn't sound bad, does it?
If you team up with me at that battle power,

177
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,460
I think we could somehow
manage Zarbon and Dodoria.

178
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,200
Spout more of your worthless lies, will you?
You are one thoroughly disgusting bastard!

179
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,480
It's no lie, I tell you!

180
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,880
Believe me, Vegeta!

181
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,850
Oh! Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

182
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,820
What?!

183
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,950
Miserable fool!

184
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,620
No matter how much his battle power had risen,

185
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,890
nobody could stand up
to being taken unawares by that.

186
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,290
You wish.

187
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:45,030
What an utterly pathetic strategy,
coming from someone like you. I'm astounded.

188
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,570
W-When did you manage to–?

189
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:52,810
Having an elevated battle power means
that my speed has been elevated as well.

190
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,010
In other words, you have
now gotten me thoroughly angry.

191
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,040
Die!

192
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:32,780
That was one foul firework.

193
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,950
V-Vegeta's 24,000 rating
is the real thing, all right.

194
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,060
He did in Kewie with no trouble at all.

195
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,260
It is of little import. Now, we
search for the fifth Dragon Ball.

196
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,410
<i>Thanks to their Scouters,</i>
<i>they'll know exactly what my actions are.</i>

197
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,410
<i>Even if I were careless</i>
<i>enough to get too close to them,</i>

198
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,410
<i>I might be able to take Zarbon or Dodoria,</i>

199
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,210
<i>but there's still no way I can beat Freeza.</i>

200
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:10,790
<i>Judging by the transmissions I heard</i>
<i>over the Scouter between Freeza and his men,</i>

201
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:16,390
<i>these Dragon Ball things don't work</i>
<i>unless you have all seven of them together.</i>

202
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,390
All right, I'll search out just one of them.

203
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,230
Once they have gathered the remaining six,

204
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,270
I'll look for an opening
and take theirs from them.

205
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:28,840
<i>If things go right, and I get</i>
<i>them all, I'll gain eternal life.</i>

206
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,470
<i>Once I do, defeating Freeza</i>
<i>will no longer be just a dream!</i>

207
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,850
There is a reading of around
ten Namekians in that direction.

208
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,850
Very well.

209
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,650
It would be nice if they
had the fifth Dragon Ball.

210
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,160
Please make sure not
to let your guard down.

211
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,330
It would seem there are some mysterious
others out there, in addition to Vegeta.

212
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,630
Yes, sir.

213
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,070
Now, let us be going.

214
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,540
With him gone, <i>I'll</i> be number one.

215
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,810
The whole universe will be
ruled by Vegeta<i>-sama</i> the Saiyan!

216
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,390
Bulma<i>-san</i>, we have to hurry a little bit more,

217
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,230
or they're going to find us out here!

218
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,200
You guys can fly, right?
Take me with you, and fly.

219
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,370
I wish we could do that, but
we're walking to mask our presence.

220
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:41,210
Flying through the air requires a lot of <i>ki,</i>
and the enemy will know where we are.

221
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:49,250
Bulma<i>-san</i>, there's a good place.
It will be hard to find us in that hole.

222
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,300
H-How long am I going to
have to live in a place like that?

223
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,260
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

224
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,870
Do you sense any <i>ki</i> over there?

225
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:09,000
You're right. It feels different
from the <i>ki</i> we felt earlier, huh?

226
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,210
It could be the Namekians this time.

227
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,210
Hide! There's another <i>ki</i>
coming this way from that direction!

228
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:22,420
<i>What is this ki that is coming</i>
<i>toward them at top speed? Is it Vegeta?</i>

229
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,590
<i>Or is it Freeza and company?</i>

230
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,610
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

231
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,450
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

232
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,820
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

233
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:05,320
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

234
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,830
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

235
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

236
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,440
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

237
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,110
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

238
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

239
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

240
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,490
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

241
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

242
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,200
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

243
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,370
<i>So sorry.</i>

244
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

245
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

246
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,560
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

247
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,900
<i>I'm so excited!</i>

248
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,160
<i>To think that there's someone</i>
<i>out there even stronger than Vegeta.</i>

249
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,570
<i>I'm going to Planet Namek!</i>

250
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:22,340
<i>He's an idiot. He's got</i>
<i>zero chance of beating him.</i>

251
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,410
<i>He ain't normal, that's fer sure.</i>

252
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,170
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

253
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:30,040
<i>"Goku's Power Unleashed!!</i>
<i>Six Days to the Far End of the Galaxy."</i>

254
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,750
<i>Freeza, just you wait! My father is coming!</i>

255
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,680
"Next time"
"Goku's Power Unleashed!!
Six Days to the Far End of the Galaxy"
