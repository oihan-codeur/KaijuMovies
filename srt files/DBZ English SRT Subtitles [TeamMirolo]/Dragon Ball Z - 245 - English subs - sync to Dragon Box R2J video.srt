<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,370
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,090
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,020
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,730
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,240
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,070
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,660
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,660
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,340
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,220
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,050
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,680
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,680
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,060
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,230
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,070
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,900
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,160
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,710
<i>To defeat the outrageous Majin Boo,</i>

24
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,040
<i>Goku has begun his Fusion</i>
<i>special training with Goten and Trunks!</i>

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,060
<i>Elsewhere, where Madoshi</i>
<i>Babidi and Majin Boo are...</i>

26
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,610
I just received some significant information!

27
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,360
It seems that one of
those three urchins, Trunks,

28
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:31,450
lives in a house called the
Capsule Corporation, in Metro West.

29
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,880
Perhaps we should go and see him.

30
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,050
You'd better come on out!

31
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,960
Otherwise, the city where
you live will cease to exist!

32
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,390
Son-<i>kun</i>, it really will be
bad if Metro West is destroyed!

33
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,930
The Dragon Radar will also be lost!

34
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,060
All right, Trunks...

35
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,440
You return home as fast as you can,
get the Radar, and bring it back for us!

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,320
I will delay Majin Boo
and Babidi for a little while.

37
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,950
Yo!

38
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,250
I'll kill him for you.
I hate him for acting goody-goody.

39
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,720
<i>Majin Boo and Babidi are</i>
<i>headed toward Metro West.</i>

40
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,590
<i>Can Goku possibly stop them?</i>

41
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,060
Well, shall I see about going
once more beyond a Super Saiyan

42
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,940
that's gone beyond Super Saiyan?

43
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:47,530
<i>"An Astounding, Great Transformation!!</i>
<i>Super Saiyan 3."</i>

44
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,300
Go even beyond having
gone beyond Super-whatever...?

45
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,510
What is all this?

46
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,680
What the hell is this guy saying?
I don't get it at all.

47
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,680
Majin Boo, hurry and put this
guy away, and let's go to Metro West!

48
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,150
<i>By all appearances, he seems</i>
<i>to be utterly weak, and yet...</i>

49
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,160
<i>And yet, as an opponent, not even</i>
<i>Vegeta could do anything against him.</i>

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,790
<i>I have to do something to keep him</i>
<i>here until Trunks can get the Dragon Radar.</i>

51
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,150
I wonder if Trunks has reached
the Capsule Corporation yet.

52
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,780
No, he's still on his way.

53
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,080
<i>Hm? Trunks' ki ain't moving.</i>

54
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,910
<i>Is he just standing there?</i>

55
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,880
<i>Hurry it up, already!</i>

56
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,920
<i>If possible, I didn't want to take</i>
<i>my form even beyond Super Saiyan...</i>

57
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,930
This is Goten's father's <i>ki</i>?!
It's an incredible <i>ki</i>!

58
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,560
Besides that, all of a sudden,
he's traveled way past me!

59
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,440
Is this that Instantaneous
Movement technique?

60
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,530
Do you hear me?! Come on!!

61
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,910
Go get the Radar now!!

62
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,280
R-Right!

63
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,460
W-What?

64
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,540
Who the hell are you talking to? What radar?

65
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,800
Nothing at all. Don't worry about it.

66
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,100
It could be that old guy is
about as strong as Papa was...

67
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,020
In any case, I have to go
get the Dragon Radar fast!

68
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,570
It would seem you've got
something futile planned, huh?

69
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,940
Perhaps.

70
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,990
<i>There's no way around it.</i>
<i>Shall we buy a little time, then?</i>

71
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,500
Why'd you go back? You giving up?

72
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,170
That ain't it.

73
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:50,750
What I'm doing is explaining
to you about Super Saiyans

74
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:53,840
so you can easily understand.

75
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,470
Super... Saiyan?

76
00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,020
You needn't take the trouble.
We don't even want to know about it.

77
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,100
Aw, don't say that. Ready?

78
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,020
First, this is my usual state, right?

79
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,940
This is me as a Super Saiyan.

80
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,950
And then...

81
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:22,490
...this is a Super Saiyan that's
gone even beyond Super Saiyan.

82
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,250
So, I guess you could call it Super Saiyan 2.

83
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,290
Just insignificant transformations!

84
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,210
No great change between them, is there?

85
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,050
And then...

86
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,350
From a Super Saiyan that
has gone beyond Super Saiyan,

87
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,890
h-he's going beyond even farther?

88
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:47,140
Y-You're just bluffing, right Goku?

89
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,190
To think there's something even higher...!

90
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,860
...this...

91
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,150
G-Goku...

92
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,240
...is going even further beyond Super Saiyan...!

93
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:30,270
S-Stop, Goku! I-If you do that,
your remaining time will disappear!

94
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,900
Your time is limited!

95
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,430
I-Incredible! His <i>ki</i> is
swelling up more and more!

96
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,430
Father...!

97
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,310
W-What is this...?!

98
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:18,400
Awesome! It's even bigger than it was earlier!

99
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,910
Ah, I shouldn't be doing this!

100
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,660
I have to hurry!

101
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,070
Stop! Stop it, Goku!

102
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,930
...attacking the Earth...

103
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,650
Th-The entire Earth is shaking!

104
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,200
I-Is this Goku's power?
Even with us so far away?

105
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,910
W-W-What's happening?!

106
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,290
This is Super Saiyan 3!

107
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:17,500
Sorry it took so much time.

108
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,540
I'm still not used to this transformation.

109
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:36,680
I-Is that Goku?!

110
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,820
Th-This <i>ki</i>... Don't tell me
this is Father's, on Earth...

111
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,820
No, it isn't...

112
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,830
Y-Yes, it is!

113
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,160
It's Son Goku-<i>san.</i>

114
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,170
It's an extraordinary energy,
but I'm certain of it!

115
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,010
M-Most unbelievable!

116
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,840
For any power to reach
this sacred region from Earth...!

117
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,810
D-Dad! What in the world is happening?!

118
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,970
You might have made a scary face,
but I'm not at all scared!

119
00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:01,730
Th-That's right, you fool!
What about this Super-whatever-3?

120
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,440
You're just trying to look tough!

121
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,980
Majin Boo! Give it to him right away!

122
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,190
That's right. Let's hurry and do this.

123
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,700
Through me, everyone on Earth is
watching this! Boo, put him to shame!

124
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,210
<i>Ain't Trunks done yet?</i>

125
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,560
I'm home!

126
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,850
He's there! Trunks has arrived there!

127
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:48,820
He made it! Now the
Dragon Radar will be all right!

128
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,820
Way to go, Trunks!

129
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,440
Grandpa!

130
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,450
Trunks, welcome home.

131
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:06,460
My, my, my! You're just in time!
I just prepared some tea.

132
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,840
There isn't time for that!

133
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,800
Oh! Would you have preferred milk over tea?

134
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Or perhaps some cocoa?

135
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,840
No, it's not like that!

136
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,470
Um, so what are some of the other
things that Trunks likes? Juice, maybe?

137
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,020
Or maybe iced coffee?

138
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,020
No, no! Say, where's the Dragon Radar?!

139
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,400
Dragon Radar?

140
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,030
Uh-huh!

141
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:41,870
Ah, let's see... the Dragon Radar...
Mm... as I remember...

142
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:45,580
Hurry up! Hurry! Hurry!

143
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,670
Get him, Majin Boo!

144
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,100
Boo!

145
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,870
Majin Boo! What's the matter with you?!

146
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,290
Boo!

147
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,800
Awesome! Incredible, Goku!

148
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,970
Father! You can beat him like this, for sure!

149
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,810
I'm not so sure.

150
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,770
To be sure, Goku is so
incredible that we can't believe it.

151
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:54,320
However, even so, I'm not sure
whether or not he can defeat Boo there.

152
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,950
This Majin Boo, is he really that terrible?

153
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,450
Yeah...

154
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,960
Someone is fighting with Boo!

155
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,790
Incredible!

156
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:15,540
I don't know who you are, but hang
in there! Take out Majin Boo for us!

157
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,170
What are you doing, Boo?!

158
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,340
B-Boo!

159
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,800
Hey, what was that? What was that?

160
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,920
–What happened!
–Did he get him?

161
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,360
Great! Great!

162
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,980
<i>Sheesh! Hardly any damage at all?</i>

163
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,870
<i>That's Vegeta's technique!</i>

164
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,380
<i>You lousy rat...</i>

165
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,550
<i>It appears you absorb all</i>
<i>of an opponent's techniques</i>

166
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,720
<i>just by fighting with them a little bit.</i>

167
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,310
What's the matter, Boo?!
Hurry up and take care of this guy!

168
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,310
Goku! That's enough. Leave it at that!

169
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,100
If you keep using that extraordinary power,

170
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:39,150
your time on Earth will be drastically reduced!

171
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,860
You have to teach Fusion to the little ones!

172
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,510
For a goody-goody, you're pretty strong.

173
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,690
Same to you.

174
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:22,690
Hey, Majin Boo! What's taking so long?!

175
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,320
Hurry up and beat that guy!

176
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,690
You shut up!

177
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,360
W-What? What's this?!

178
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,700
You dare take that tone toward your master?

179
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:36,200
Hey, see here! Are you listening to me, Boo?!

180
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,330
I'm telling you to hurry
up and defeat that guy!

181
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,170
<i>Trunks still hasn't left yet.</i>

182
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:48,340
Trunks! What are you doing?! Hurry up!

183
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,680
Trunks?

184
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,230
Radar! Radar! Come on, where is it?

185
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:00,020
I'm sure it's around here.

186
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,070
I knew it! You were contacting that Trunks kid!

187
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,690
Hey, Boo!

188
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,700
Beat this guy up thoroughly and
make him tell us where Trunks is!

189
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,620
<i>Yeesh. I guess I have to</i>
<i>buy us even more time.</i>

190
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,260
Way to go, Goku! That's the way!

191
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,260
Father...!

192
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:49,280
<i>Goku has gone even beyond having</i>
<i>gone even beyond Super Saiyan!</i>

193
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,330
<i>His force is brutal!</i>

194
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,370
Not here, not here, not
here, not here, not here!

195
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:02,750
Not here, not here,
not here, not here, not here!

196
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:05,750
It isn't anywhere!!

197
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:11,130
<i>Hasn't Trunks found the Dragon Radar yet?</i>

198
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,640
<i>It's possible that Goku</i>
<i>might defeat Majin Boo!</i>

199
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,820
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

200
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,410
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

201
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,970
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

202
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

203
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,110
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

204
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,490
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

205
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,320
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

206
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

207
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,960
<i>Even now?</i>

208
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,590
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

209
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,970
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

210
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:48,480
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

211
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:58,490
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

212
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,760
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

213
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,380
<i>Very impressive, Majin Boo.</i>

214
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,600
<i>If I had the time, I'd like to play</i>
<i>with you at a more leisurely pace.</i>

215
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,930
<i>Be more careful, Majin Boo! You imbecile!</i>

216
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:27,940
<i>Can't you fight more cautiously?!</i>
<i>I was almost put in danger!</i>

217
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,230
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

218
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,400
<i>"Bye Bye Babidi!! Majin Boo Rebels."</i>

219
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,530
<i>Stop, Babidi! Don't make</i>
<i>Majin Boo any angrier!</i>

220
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,610
"Next time"
"Bye Bye Babidi!! Majin Boo Rebels"
