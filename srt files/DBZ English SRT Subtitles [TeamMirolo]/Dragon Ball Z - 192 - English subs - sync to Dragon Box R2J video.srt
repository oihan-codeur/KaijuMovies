That was awesome!

26
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:35,325
Hey, Gohan! You were
really incredible! You did it!

27
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:41,835
I still can't believe it!
We've all been spared, huh?

28
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:42,835
Yeah.

29
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,835
We'll take you to where Dende is
in the Heavenly Realm right away.

30
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,215
Even without <i>senzu</i> beans,

31
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:49,505
once we have him touch you,
you'll be back in business!

32
00:03:56,725 --> 00:03:58,305
All right, let's go.

33
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:03,185
Th-Thanks...

34
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:04,355
G-Gohan!

35
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:07,815
It's all right. He's just passed out.

36
00:04:07,855 --> 00:04:11,575
Never mind him, are you okay, Yamucha?

37
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:15,035
Are you sure you can fly all the way to
the Heavenly Realm in the shape you're in?

38
00:04:15,075 --> 00:04:19,205
Hey, compared to what Gohan
has done, it'll be a piece of cake.

39
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:21,035
You don't say.

40
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:23,205
Well, I guess I'll take Trunks.

41
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:27,455
Yeah, okay then, I'll take No. 18.

42
00:04:30,425 --> 00:04:34,555
A-After all, she was one of Cell's victims, too.

43
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,475
H-Hey...

44
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:53,575
Piccolo, we're going!

45
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:55,735
Yeah, you guys go on ahead!

46
00:04:55,775 --> 00:04:56,985
Okay.

47
00:05:04,835 --> 00:05:07,415
Let me give you a hand, Vegeta.

48
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,795
You mind your own business.

49
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:16,425
Go on, anytime you want.
I don't need any of your help.

50
00:05:16,465 --> 00:05:18,305
Is that right?

51
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:54,135
I've been completely outdone by
them, both the father and the son.

52
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:58,345
D-Damn you, Kakarrot!

53
00:06:00,385 --> 00:06:03,475
Dying the way you did...!

54
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:12,565
I won't ever fight again.

55
00:06:30,415 --> 00:06:33,585
W-What was all that with those guys?

56
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:48,515
I-It's gotten quiet...

57
00:06:50,185 --> 00:06:55,525
M-Mister Satan! What in the world happened?

58
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:57,525
Eh? W-Well...

59
00:07:02,405 --> 00:07:09,375
I saw the <i>bento</i> salesboy and Cell ramming
that strange light against each other,

60
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:12,375
but after that incredible
explosion, I couldn't see anything.

61
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:15,835
Oh, no, I suppose not, I suppose not.

62
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:19,555
Where's Cell? What happened to Cell?

63
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:24,765
Huh? C-Cell, um...

64
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:28,225
I-I defeated him!

65
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:29,975
I wish...?

66
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:37,405
It's the broadcast van we drove in on!

67
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:39,575
Just what you'd expect of Mister Satan!

68
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:42,785
In the end, he settled things for us!

69
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:45,075
Hiding your true ability like that–

70
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:48,245
what a marvelous performance, Satan-<i>sama</i>!

71
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:51,125
I-Is that really so?

72
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:53,125
O-Of course it is.

73
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,755
H-How in the world did you do it?

74
00:07:55,795 --> 00:08:01,255
Hey, they kept dragging out
that senseless light-ball trick,

75
00:08:01,295 --> 00:08:04,055
so I became impatient, and
sent Cell flying good and hard,

76
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,805
telling him to cut it out already!

77
00:08:10,265 --> 00:08:11,395
Good and hard!

78
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:12,775
How captivating!

79
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:18,235
S-So then, what about the
<i>bento</i> salesboy, and those others?

80
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:21,445
Good and hard! Huh?

81
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:24,785
Ah, they thanked me, and then went home.

82
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:29,245
Hey! The radio in the
broadcast van is working!

83
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:33,795
A-All right. Mister Satan, what
you've just told me is the truth, right?

84
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:36,165
Who do you take me for?

85
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:40,715
I am the World Combat Sports
Champion, Mister Satan-<i>sama</i>!

86
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,465
That's right!

87
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:45,465
The Earth has been saved
from the demonic clutches of Cell!

88
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,015
Give him your thanks!

89
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,815
People of the world, thank you for waiting!

90
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:56,145
We now resume our broadcast!

91
00:08:56,185 --> 00:09:02,825
Rejoice, people of the world!
The Earth–the Earth has been saved!

92
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:05,735
Thanks to Mister Satan!

93
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:10,825
That's our Mister Satan!

94
00:09:10,865 --> 00:09:12,205
He did it!

95
00:09:12,245 --> 00:09:13,875
Yeah!

96
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:19,215
Satan! Satan! Satan!

97
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:22,005
A savior appeared for us.

98
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,385
Perhaps all of our prayers to God reached him.

99
00:09:25,425 --> 00:09:26,715
We must be grateful.

100
00:09:27,885 --> 00:09:29,885
Pa!

101
00:09:30,845 --> 00:09:32,385
Th-There, now...

102
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:38,185
Well, that settles that, huh?

103
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:42,065
Yeah, all because of you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>. Thank you.

104
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:52,415
Now that the pressure's off, I'm hungry!

105
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:55,535
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, do you have anything to eat?

106
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,545
What are you talking about?!

107
00:09:57,585 --> 00:10:02,545
You blew my planet away,
so now there's nothing!

108
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,585
Is that right?

109
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,555
Oh, I'm so hungry, I could die!

110
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:08,555
You're already dead.

111
00:10:08,595 --> 00:10:11,595
What choice do I have? I guess I'll eat this.

112
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:17,565
This ain't filling me up at all.

113
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:20,895
Good grief, what a lively dead person.

114
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:24,645
Are they coming?

115
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:31,575
Hey! You guys all did purty good!

116
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:32,745
Yajirobe!

117
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:38,745
Y'know, I was gonna go help out too,
but my aircraft was all on the fritz.

118
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,585
You don't say.

119
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:42,965
You never really meant to come.

120
00:10:57,645 --> 00:11:00,105
A-Are you Dende?

121
00:11:00,145 --> 00:11:03,025
Yes. Let me see Gohan-<i>san</i>, quickly.

122
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:25,125
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

123
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:25,755
Dende...

124
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:27,545
Thank goodness!

125
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,505
I'm so sorry about Goku-<i>san.</i>

126
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:39,515
It's not like that.

127
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:46,025
I was able to hear my father's voice.

128
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:53,825
I felt Father's <i>ki</i>, and could even smell him.

129
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:58,705
I was together with Father the
whole time I was fighting with Cell.

130
00:11:58,745 --> 00:12:02,745
It was because I was with
Father that I was able to beat Cell.

131
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:07,375
Well...

132
00:12:07,415 --> 00:12:10,215
In any event, you've done well, Gohan.

133
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:11,545
Piccolo-<i>san...</i>

134
00:12:14,255 --> 00:12:17,555
You really have grown strong, huh Gohan?

135
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:36,365
You've come to, have you?

136
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:37,825
Dende!

137
00:12:37,865 --> 00:12:40,825
You'd better get away
from her, fast! You'll be killed!

138
00:12:40,865 --> 00:12:42,955
That's not going to happen!

139
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:49,585
Th-This is Kami-<i>sama</i>'s Temple. You're all right.

140
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,175
Cell has been defeated by Gohan.

141
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:53,555
Gohan?

142
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:54,715
That's right!

143
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,055
He's ridiculously strong!

144
00:12:57,095 --> 00:13:00,845
It won't do you any good to start rampaging!

145
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:03,395
Hey, you! Come a little closer.

146
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,225
You can thank Kuririn.

147
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:09,435
He did all he could to stand up
for you after Cell spat you out.

148
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:18,405
Y-Yeah, well, I mean, we
couldn't just leave you there.

149
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,785
I get it!

150
00:13:20,825 --> 00:13:24,415
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, you're fond of No. 18!

151
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,255
Don't just come right out and say it!

152
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:29,415
Eh?! Are you serious?!

153
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,425
You're kidding, right?!

154
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:33,465
S-She's an Artificial Human!

155
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:40,435
Who were you expecting to be grateful?

156
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:41,935
Did you think you would get me

157
00:13:41,975 --> 00:13:44,555
to clasp my hands together and say thank you?

158
00:13:44,595 --> 00:13:46,775
Eh, mister?

159
00:13:46,815 --> 00:13:48,645
Don't kid yourself.

160
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:59,575
Why, that jerk!

161
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,785
What kind of attitude was that?!

162
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,995
I'm going to send her sailing!

163
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:06,375
I doubt you could, though.

164
00:14:07,835 --> 00:14:10,965
Never mind her, shouldn't
our first order of business

165
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,295
be to hurry up and use the Dragon Balls...

166
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:15,795
...to bring Trunks and the other
people who were killed back to life?

167
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,255
Yes, yes.

168
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:21,635
I-It's all right, Kuririn-<i>san.</i>

169
00:14:21,675 --> 00:14:24,805
As far as friends go, you've got us, don't you?

170
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,435
J-Just shut up...!

171
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:45,535
Come forth, Dragon, and grant us our wish.

172
00:15:01,885 --> 00:15:04,555
W-What is that?

173
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,215
No matter how many times I see him,
Shen Long is always incredible.

174
00:15:33,255 --> 00:15:34,375
Y-Yeah...

175
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:39,845
Kami-<i>sama</i>, nice work.
Shen Long perfectly restored.

176
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:41,385
T-Thanks.

177
00:15:41,425 --> 00:15:48,225
Now, speak forth thy wishes.
I shall grant thee any two wishes.

178
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:52,435
Two? That's right, thanks to Dende,

179
00:15:52,475 --> 00:15:55,145
the number of wishes has increased to two.

180
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:58,605
Shen Long!

181
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:04,245
Please bring those people who
were killed by Cell back to life!

182
00:16:04,285 --> 00:16:06,825
That is a simple matter.

183
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:26,055
Satan! Satan! Satan!

184
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:29,265
W-What?!

185
00:16:29,305 --> 00:16:31,435
Everyone, please listen!

186
00:16:31,475 --> 00:16:32,815
The military that was annihilated,

187
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:33,975
as well as the people
from the city who were lost,

188
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:36,395
are reportedly coming
back to life one after another!

189
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:37,775
It's a miracle!

190
00:16:37,815 --> 00:16:41,405
This is also thanks to Satan defeating Cell!

191
00:16:41,445 --> 00:16:44,155
That's right!

192
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:57,585
Sure enough, it didn't work.

193
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:02,795
The Dragon Balls and Shen Long
that Dende reconstructed...

194
00:17:02,835 --> 00:17:05,805
Just in case, I sought him out,

195
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:08,635
but sure enough, I can't sense Son's <i>ki.</i>

196
00:17:08,675 --> 00:17:10,805
He hasn't come back to life.

197
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:12,265
Is that so?

198
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:16,355
I can grant thee one more wish.

199
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:19,195
Speak thy second wish.

200
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:24,365
Isn't there any way you can
bring Goku... Son Goku back to life?

201
00:17:24,405 --> 00:17:27,195
We absolutely want him brought back to life.

202
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:31,455
Son Goku has already
been brought back to life once.

203
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:36,375
It is not possible. Speak thee another wish.

204
00:17:36,415 --> 00:17:38,375
He says he can't do it.

205
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:42,175
No, I'm sure there's a good
way to go about this. Think!

206
00:17:43,255 --> 00:17:45,005
What about this?

207
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:49,175
What if we have time turned
back to before Goku died?

208
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:50,725
Oh! Let's go with that!

209
00:17:50,765 --> 00:17:52,145
If we do that,

210
00:17:52,185 --> 00:17:54,805
then Cell will also be resurrected,
before he blew himself up.

211
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:56,725
We'd be right back where we started.

212
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:57,725
That's right...

213
00:17:57,765 --> 00:18:00,195
I know!

214
00:18:00,235 --> 00:18:03,365
We could just ask Polunga on Planet Namek!

215
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:04,365
I get you.

216
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:07,035
Polunga, the original Shen Long,

217
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:10,365
can bring people back to
life any number of times.

218
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:12,415
That's right.

219
00:18:12,455 --> 00:18:15,375
Both Chaozu and Kuririn were
brought back to life that way.

220
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:18,835
In that case, if one of us goes to Planet Namek...

221
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,835
Well, should we make that our second wish?

222
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,925
Guys, hold on a second!

223
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:28,385
It's me! It's Goku!

224
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:29,385
Goku?

225
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:30,845
F-Father?

226
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,055
I'm speaking to you from the Next World.

227
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,475
Listen to me, would you?

228
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:39,395
There was something that
Bulma mentioned a long time ago.

229
00:18:39,435 --> 00:18:43,235
She said it was like I drew bad guys towards me.

230
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:46,235
When you think about it,
she's certainly right, ain't she?

231
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:49,115
Mm-hmm, that could be so, all right.

232
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:52,115
That Bulma is always saying too much.

233
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,245
And so, I have a hunch that the Earth

234
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:56,575
will be more peaceful without me around.

235
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:59,125
Kaio-<i>sama</i> admits to that, too.

236
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:00,795
Well, I suppose...

237
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:04,255
It ain't as though I'm
saying I'm some kind of victim.

238
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:06,255
Since I've saved the Earth and stuff,

239
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:09,595
Kaio-<i>sama</i> says they're
going to treat me special.

240
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:12,055
Ordinary folks, and bad guys
like Cell become just spirits,

241
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:16,435
but they're going to let me keep my body.

242
00:19:16,475 --> 00:19:19,435
What's more, I won't get any older like this.

243
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:22,275
There's also fighting experts
from the past in the Next World here,

244
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:24,485
and it sounds like it's going to be lots of fun.

245
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:28,405
Experts from the past, huh?

246
00:19:28,445 --> 00:19:32,405
Kaio-<i>sama</i> could have been brought
back to life by Shen Long's power just now,

247
00:19:32,445 --> 00:19:35,245
but he passed, saying he
would stick with me instead.

248
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:38,915
And so, maybe it ain't fair to Chichi and Gohan,

249
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:40,995
but you don't need to bring me back to life.

250
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:49,595
Gohan's already a lot more reliable than I am.

251
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:52,595
Th-That's not true, Father!

252
00:19:52,635 --> 00:19:55,265
There you have it. Bye, now.

253
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:58,765
Once you all die, I'll see you again!

254
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,855
Bye-bye!

255
00:20:04,815 --> 00:20:06,565
Goku...

256
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:20,375
You know, for a dead guy,
he sure seemed cheerful,

257
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:22,545
so I guess he's not too upset about this.

258
00:20:22,585 --> 00:20:26,915
Yeah. He's been like that ever since he was a kid.

259
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:42,395
"Oh, well," huh?

260
00:20:45,775 --> 00:20:47,895
Absolutely.

261
00:20:57,535 --> 00:21:00,705
He is always leaving us behind.

262
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:08,165
That's the kind of guy he was.

263
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:12,215
He fed me a <i>senzu</i> after I tried to kill him,

264
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:15,715
and then turned down becoming Kami.

265
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:22,435
Father was always kind...

266
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:37,365
And he always gave me courage.

267
00:21:48,165 --> 00:21:51,165
Father, thank you.

268
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:06,605
Um...

269
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:10,445
<i>Goku remains in the Next World.</i>

270
00:22:10,485 --> 00:22:15,525
<i>Gohan and the others move on,</i>
<i>with memories of Goku in their hearts.</i>

271
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:26,665
Um, I am awaiting thy second wish...

272
00:22:27,835 --> 00:22:31,955
...all this time...

273
00:22:44,725 --> 00:22:48,725
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

274
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:54,565
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

275
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,945
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

276
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

277
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:11,915
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

278
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:16,045
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

279
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:19,555
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

280
00:23:19,595 --> 00:23:22,175
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

281
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:29,685
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

282
00:23:31,935 --> 00:23:33,775
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

283
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,605
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

284
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

285
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

286
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

287
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,585
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

288
00:23:55,335 --> 00:24:00,635
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

289
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,395
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

290
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:16,605
<i>I'm going to train in the Next World,</i>

291
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:19,405
<i>but I'll come visit once in a while,</i>
<i>so keep your chin up, Gohan.</i>

292
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:22,235
<i>Hey, you don't have to</i>
<i>worry about what's to come.</i>

293
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:25,575
<i>I mean, he is your son, after all.</i>

294
00:24:25,615 --> 00:24:27,615
