<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,790

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,800
<i>And Babidi, who had</i>
<i>been cut in half by Piccolo,</i>

25
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,920
<i>was revived by Boo, and his anger set ablaze.</i>

26
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,810
That green guy and those two runts!

27
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,890
You're absolutely going to pay for this!

28

<i>Will the Earth be turned to hell by Majin Boo?</i>

<i>"The Struggle of Videl and the Others!</i>
<i>Find the Dragon Balls."</i>

30
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:04,110
Where could Gohan and Goten have gone off to?

31
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,440
Auntie, rather than these Dragon Ball things,

32
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,950
we should first be searching for
Gohan and the others, shouldn't we?

33
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,950
Hmm, Bulma-<i>san</i>?

34
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,540
We checked there,
but no one was around, right?

35
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:21,170
There's no way for us to look for them past that.

36
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:26,250
For my part, I'm not unconcerned
about Vegeta and Trunks myself.

37
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,880
Especially since Vegeta was acting so strangely.

38
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,600
Goku is together with them,
so I think they're okay.

39
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,390
We've already gathered six of the Dragon Balls.

40
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,980
Once we get the last one...

41
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,940
Bulma-<i>san</i>, don't tell me
you're thinkin' that Gohan

42
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,980
and the others are already dead, are you?

43
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,150
That we can have the Dragon
Balls bring them back to life?

44
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,070
No, that's not what I'm thinking...

45
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:52,110
As long as we don't know where everyone is,

46
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,910
I think that first we should bring
back to life all those spectators...

47
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:03,420
...that were killed as a result of Vegeta.
I... feel so sorry for them...

48
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,960
Let's hurry up findin' the Dragon Balls then.

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,090
Where's the last one at?

50
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,960
Let's see...

51
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:20,520
Can we really bring everyone
back to life with these balls?

52
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,770
If we appeal to Shen Long,
he will grant us any three wishes.

53
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,940
Yamucha, just keep going
straight for the last Dragon Ball!

54
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,610
Roger.

55
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:36,370
Yamucha, it's around here! What's beneath us?

56
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,950
Looks like it's the island in
the very middle of this lake.

57
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,750
It's there, no doubt about it. Land there!

58
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,410
Okay!

59
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,140
Yamucha! Can't you land
any better than that?!

60
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,180
Sorry, sorry! This wasn't
a very good place for it!

61
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,310
Old man! What are you doing?!

62
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,200
This wasn't my fault!
I just automatically slanted this way!

63
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,290
If you want to complain, talk to Yamucha!

64
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,330
Pafu-pafu-pafu!

65
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,750
Just like a real human!

66
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,180
Ah! My neck!

67
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,350
Why, you dirty old man!

68
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,390
Oh, please, no...!

69
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm gonna be crushed!

70
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,150
But that was the tops! The tops!

71
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,720
Things're gettin' terrible again, huh?

72
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,380
Yeah. Aren't there any more <i>senzu</i>?

73
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,140
We gave the last three
of 'em to Goku, y'know!

74
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,310
You guys're gettin' too greedy!

75
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,270
Just like always, you
know the wrong thing to say.

76
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,890
Kuririn, hang in there tough!

77
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,270
I'm gonna hold off here
an' see how things go.

78
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,820
You shut up! You're no use to anyone,
so just be quiet! Let's go, Piccolo.

79
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,340
We've been expecting you.
Are those two all right?

80
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,100
Are injuries severe?

81
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:08,640
They're not injured. Vegeta only
did enough to knock them out,

82
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,650
so it shouldn't be too serious.

83
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,070
Let them sleep for a bit inside.

84
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,480
That's easy enough. Popo?

85
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,150
Got it.

86
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:33,090
Majin Boo... A fearsome
devil has come back to life.

87
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:38,510
Mm. At this point now, those
two are our only slim hope.

88
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:43,760
Dende! Do you know
what's happened to Goku?

89
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,270
You needn't worry about
the late Goku-<i>san</i> dying again.

90
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,770
I guess that's right, huh?

91
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,450
However, Goku-<i>san</i> seems
to have taken great damage.

92
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:03,360
What about Majin Boo and Madoshi Babidi?

93
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,500
Their <i>ki</i>, filled with evil,
grows greater and greater.

94
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,040
And Gohan?

95
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,500
Unfortunately, I cannot feel him.

96
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,040
I see.

97
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,670
Dende, can you feel Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>'s <i>ki</i>?

98
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:22,680
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, you must be
able to feel it too, right?

99
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,680
Yeah. It's become weak,

100
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,510
but I can definitely feel Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>'s <i>ki.</i>

101
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:32,270
Yes. Piccolo-<i>san</i>, what's going
to happen to the Earth now?

102
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,360
If you, the Kami over the Earth can't tell,
there's no reason I should be able to!

103
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,280
Sorry...

104
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,700
Even Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> had this
much difficulty against this enemy.

105
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,410
You have to know that our chances
of winning against them are very slim.

106
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,630
I wonder what's going to happen now.

107
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,470
Laid the two down to sleep. They fine soon.

108
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:08,510
Can't fight if hungry. Meal is ready. Quickly!

109
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,430
Be my guest.

110
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,570
<i>Kaioshin-sama,</i>

111
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,990
<i>is there nothing more I can do but</i>
<i>stake everything on those two little ones?</i>

112
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,010
Gohan-<i>san</i>... Please be alive...

113
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,890
We will need your power...
to defeat Majin Boo...

114
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,620
Stop!

115
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,560
Why didn't you avoid that?!

116
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,070
Here it is!

117
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,050
Bulma! Hang in there!

118
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,760
Isn't anyone going to help her?
Auntie! Hang in there!

119
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,060
Who is she calling Auntie? How rude!

120
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,690
What are you doing?!

121
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,450
Bulma!

122
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,820
You dummy! You can't eat that! You dummy!

123
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,540
Ah! Thief! Thief! Thief!!

124
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,500
Take this!

125
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,760
Gotcha!

126
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,650
Yamucha, you have to
take responsibility for this!

127
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,860
Dive in after and chase it down!

128
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,070
Right, right!

129
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,360
Dive from up here?!

130
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,460
This suit was kind of expensive, you know!

131
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,370
You can always take it off!

132
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,800
The trunks I'm wearing
today are awful flashy though...

133
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,510
Come on! It's getting away, you know!

134
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:59,850
I think I've come down with a cold today...!

135
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,430
No. 18?

136
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,440
I don't handle water very well.
You know that, don't you?

137
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,020
This is no time to be saying that,
already! Chichi-<i>san</i>, please?

138
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,810
All right!

139
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,700
Videl-<i>san</i>! You're gonna be
Gohan's bride! Don't go gettin' hurt!

140
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:27,120
We're counting on this, Four-Star-Ball!

141
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,500
Me too!

142
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:25,640
Flashy trunks be damned!
If I don't go now, I'm not a man!

143
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,990
See here, Videl-<i>san</i>'s gonna be
Gohan's bride! Keep your paws off!

144
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:47,160
Cut it out! Don't embarrass me any further!

145
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,260
I've got a cold! A cold!

146
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,430
Here you go!

147
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,470
Good luck, there!

148
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,650
Ah! Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>!

149
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,840
Pee-yew!

150
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:48,350
Let's get over our colds quickly!

151
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,900
Turtle Hermit, thanks.

152
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,200
That's our Muten Roshi!
He's not just a dirty old man!

153
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,260
Boo! Boo! Turn to the left!

154
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,720
O-Or you can go right, too, just turn!

155
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,340
Damn... Vegeta took the last remaining <i>senzu.</i>

156
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,630
He knocked me out and went off
alone to where Majin Boo is, didn't he?

157
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,820
I can feel Majin Boo's <i>ki,</i>
but Vegeta's <i>ki</i> ain't there!

158
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,910
Did he get beaten?

159
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,330
I can't feel Gohan's <i>ki</i> either.

160
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,580
Piccolo and Kuririn are alive.

161
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,130
They must have been returned
from stone back to normal.

162
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,540
Those two might know what's been going on!

163
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:29,720
How long do you suppose
until the two pee-wees wake up?

164
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,390
Let's see, probably another hour or so.

165
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,430
I can't stand this. Both
Vegeta and Gohan are dead.

166
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,270
I weep for them!

167
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,770
This is the worst!

168
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:45,230
We don't know what happened to Goku, at all.

169
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:49,360
Say, Dende–or rather,
Kami-<i>sama</i>, would it be okay

170
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,240
if I brought everyone in my family here?

171
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,700
I guess that would be wrong, huh?
Us only choosing to save our own folks.

172
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,080
–What about that?
–You're Kami. Use your own judgement.

173
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,130
I don't think I would mind.

174
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:06,710
After all, it's because of everyone
that we have the Earth here now.

175
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,090
It's the least I can do.

176
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:10,760
Thank you! I'll go and call them now!

177
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,270
Th-That <i>ki</i>! It's...!

178
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,940
Yo!

179
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,190
Goku! Then you survived?!

180
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,120
You might say I survived,
but I'm still dead, you know!

181
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,750
I guess so! You still have the halo and all!

182
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:50,130
Kuririn, I came to hear what happened.

183
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:54,140
What happened yourself?!
You're pretty banged up!

184
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,140
I will heal you, Goku-<i>san</i>!

185
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,760
Yeah, Dende, if you would!

186
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,180
Piccolo, now that Goku has come,

187
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,440
our hopes for fighting Majin Boo
have just gotten greater, haven't they?

188
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:19,700
<i>Goku's heavily damaged body is</i>
<i>healed through Dende's mysterious power.</i>

189
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,460
<i>Are there any means left for Goku</i>
<i>and the others to defeat Majin Boo?</i>

190
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,890
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

191
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,480
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

192
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:56,030
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

193
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,120
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

194
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,130
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

195
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,510
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

196
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,390
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

197
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:27,440
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

198
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,980
<i>Even now?</i>

199
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:36,650
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

200
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,030
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

201
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:48,500
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

202
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:58,550
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

203
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,610
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

204
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,650
<i>If we're gonna defeat Majin Boo,</i>
<i>we'll have to use Fusion.</i>

205
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,780
<i>It's a move where two similar folks</i>
<i>become one, with awesome power!</i>

206
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,790
<i>Goten and Trunks,</i>
<i>power and size about identical.</i>

207
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,040
<i>Can they do Fusion?</i>

208
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,170
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

209

<i>"Enormous Hope!! A New Finishing</i>
<i>Technique for the Little Squirts."</i>

210
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,840
<i>Terrific! Knowing those two,</i>
<i>I'm sure they can do it!</i>

211
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,630
