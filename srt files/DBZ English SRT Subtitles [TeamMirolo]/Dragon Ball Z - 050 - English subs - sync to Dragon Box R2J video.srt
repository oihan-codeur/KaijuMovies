00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:17,475
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:24,785
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,745
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:08,225
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,735
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:26,685
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:30,255
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:37,125
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:56,485
<i>The Dragon Balls were falling into</i>
<i>the brutal hands of Freeza and his men.</i>

17
00:02:11,735 --> 00:02:17,435
<i>Instinctively jumping into the fray,</i>
<i>Gohan rescued the Namekian child.</i>

18
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:25,245
<i>Gohan was in jeopardy as</i>
<i>Dodoria followed in hot pursuit.</i>

19
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:32,255
<i>However, Vegeta then appeared before him.</i>

20
00:02:38,755 --> 00:02:42,625
We Saiyans grow stronger every time we fight.

21
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:04,775
<i>And Goku continued his</i>
<i>intensive training inside his spaceship</i>

22
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:08,015
<i>as it headed toward Planet Namek.</i>

23
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:21,195
<i>"Escape From a Burning Planet!!</i>
<i>A Life-or-Death Kamehame-Ha."</i>

24
00:03:32,885 --> 00:03:35,275
I shot down Dodoria!

25
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:39,215
I easily beat Dodoria,
who took such pride in his own power!

26
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:44,655
Even <i>I'm</i> surprised by how much I've improved.

27
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:49,225
It truly seems that my
battle on Earth was not in vain.

28
00:03:49,265 --> 00:03:53,795
Be that as it may, Dodoria
did say something curious...

29
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:58,675
I see now. Those runts I was chasing
earlier were Earthlings, weren't they?!

30
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:03,805
I do indeed sense two large
powers getting farther away.

31
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:07,645
Of course they couldn't be
Earthlings, but it's still disturbing.

32
00:04:07,685 --> 00:04:10,215
Maybe I should go look into it, just to see.

33
00:04:10,255 --> 00:04:15,185
Whatever the case, I have to get rid of
even the small fries that stand in my way.

34
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:31,695
The cave that Bulma<i>-san</i>
is hiding in is right over there.

35
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:35,645
For this being a planet you've never been to
before, I'm surprised you remember so well.

36
00:04:37,275 --> 00:04:40,805
What's that?! Something is
coming! It's incredibly fast!

37
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:45,245
Hide! Quickly!

38
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,415
Right!

39
00:04:49,225 --> 00:04:52,585
We'll be found if we stay here, won't we?

40
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,785
Never mind, just hurry up and suppress your <i>ki</i>!

41
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:57,225
All we can do now is
leave our fate up to heaven.

42
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:02,195
Will it be someone like
that monster from earlier?

43
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,575
Dammit, how did they know where we were?

44
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:16,245
Both of the power readings
have disappeared. What's going on?

45
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:18,615
Over in that area, all of a sudden...

46
00:05:29,265 --> 00:05:32,755
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>! O-Over there!

47
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:49,805
<i>V-Vegeta! T-Then he</i>
is <i>on this planet, after all!</i>

48
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:59,455
<i>How can he be here?! This is the</i>
<i>absolute worst thing that could happen!</i>

49
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,765
He's still looking.

50
00:06:13,805 --> 00:06:18,105
He wasn't wearing one of those Scouter devices.

51
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,135
And yet, how is it that
he can tell where we are?

52
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:28,185
D-Don't tell me he has the ability to sense <i>ki</i>!

53
00:06:28,225 --> 00:06:30,515
If that's the case, then this is bad.

54
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:34,155
We might be able to extinguish
our <i>ki</i>, but this kid still has a faint one.

55
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:42,525
Damn. Was I mistaken?

56
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:45,795
Is it because I'm not yet used to
using this power sensing technique?

57
00:06:45,835 --> 00:06:49,365
Maybe I shouldn't have destroyed that Scouter.

58
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:53,545
I'm sensing a small power.

59
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:57,385
It's no mistake this time. Let's check it out.

60
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,715
He's coming this way!

61
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:04,625
<i>It's hopeless! He's going to find us!</i>

62
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:09,295
It's near that rock over there.

63
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:14,195
At this point, all we can do is fight.

64
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:17,065
Even though we know we'll get killed.

65
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:33,185
Let's go!

66
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:34,555
Right!

67
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,115
Now!

68
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:07,315
Tch! It was a fish?

69
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:19,095
Oh, well. Right now, the first
order of business is to get the two–

70
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:23,135
no, even just one of
the remaining Dragon Balls.

71
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,465
Once I've hidden it,

72
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,495
Freeza and the others will no
longer be able to get all seven together.

73
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:34,745
Then I'll find the chance to take the five

74
00:08:34,785 --> 00:08:37,545
that Freeza and company have away from them.

75
00:08:40,055 --> 00:08:42,315
Their having lost their Scouters means

76
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,985
that luck has shifted in Vegeta<i>-sama</i>'s favor!

77
00:08:57,975 --> 00:09:00,665
W-We're saved!

78
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:04,635
I thought it was completely hopeless there.

79
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:09,485
Lucky for us, huh? We have
that guy in the water to thank.

80
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,645
Anyhow, let's get back to where Bulma<i>-san</i> is,

81
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:15,985
while keeping our
presence as masked as we can.

82
00:09:16,025 --> 00:09:17,555
You said it was right close by, right?

83
00:09:17,595 --> 00:09:18,555
Yes.

84
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:23,085
We didn't even fight, and I'm already
exhausted. I'd like to get some rest.

85
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,075
I, uh...

86
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:44,145
To be honest, I'm starting to think
we shouldn't have come to this planet.

87
00:09:44,185 --> 00:09:47,985
It might not be fair to the
late Yamucha<i>-san</i> and the others,

88
00:09:48,025 --> 00:09:50,485
but far from bringing everyone back to life,

89
00:09:50,525 --> 00:09:53,455
it looks like we're just going
to be adding to the deceased.

90
00:09:53,495 --> 00:09:55,655
You mean, us?

91
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:08,105
Look! Kuririn<i>-san</i>, over there!

92
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:10,775
Yeah, right, right.

93
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,375
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

94
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,915
Huh? She's not here.

95
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:21,115
I'm sure she's hiding deeper inside the cave.

96
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,915
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

97
00:10:24,955 --> 00:10:30,325
It's us! Where are you?! Bulma<i>-san</i>!

98
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:37,165
A Capsule house!

99
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:47,805
What were you guys taking it so easy for?!

100
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:53,175
While leaving a young girl
like me alone in a place like this?!

101
00:10:54,525 --> 00:10:56,825
Taking it easy, she says...

102
00:10:58,495 --> 00:11:01,885
W-What's with the small-size
Piccolo-looking kid there?

103
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:04,485
By any chance, is that a Namekian?

104
00:11:05,935 --> 00:11:07,925
It's okay.

105
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,875
Has something happened?

106
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:17,075
For now, just let us in, please.
We'll fill you in on the details.

107
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:19,505
Oh, right!

108
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:23,105
I just got some delightful news from my dad!

109
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:27,115
He said that Son<i>-kun</i> had
blasted off for Planet Namek here!

110
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:30,145
And that he would arrive in just six days!

111
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:36,325
You see, apparently, my dad
rebuilt the Saiyan spaceship

112
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:38,495
that Son<i>-kun</i> came in as a baby!

113
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:42,495
What's more, he said that Son<i>-kun</i> was
doing some incredible training inside it

114
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,525
along the way.

115
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:48,335
F-Father?

116
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,945
Yahoo!

117
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:58,355
Yay! Hooray! Hooray!

118
00:12:02,585 --> 00:12:04,985
Incredible training along the way?

119
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,015
All right! All right! We've found some hope!

120
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:37,125
Next up, I'll do this for thirty minutes!

121
00:13:26,675 --> 00:13:29,975
Huh? Is it already time for
the next item on the schedule?

122
00:13:40,285 --> 00:13:42,415
That's strange...

123
00:13:44,095 --> 00:13:45,955
What's going on here?

124
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,365
W-What's that?

125
00:13:58,175 --> 00:14:00,565
Goku, can you hear me?

126
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:04,605
Ah, it's Bulma's daddy!
What on earth is going on?

127
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:08,005
Part of the exterior of the
spaceship has been damaged.

128
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:11,775
A meteor or something must have hit it.

129
00:14:15,055 --> 00:14:18,615
If you keep going like this,
you'll slip off course.

130
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:20,625
W-What's going to happen?!

131
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:25,625
You won't be able to go to Planet Namek.
You'll become lost in space.

132
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,165
I can't have that!

133
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:29,165
Go outside and repair it.

134
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:30,165
Repair it?!

135
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,135
Mm-hmm, it will be easy.

136
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:36,975
Inside the repair box, there should be
some material and a powerful adhesive.

137
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:48,175
Wow, so this is space, huh?

138
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:03,535
Goku, don't panic.
You've got a lifeline, don't you?

139
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:08,095
That's right. I just
have to reel myself in, huh?

140
00:15:10,575 --> 00:15:13,915
You know, this speed is amazing.

141
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,915
Yikes, I'd better hurry.

142
00:15:34,635 --> 00:15:37,035
Oh, that gave me a start.

143
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:41,205
Goku, the soles of your boots are magnets,
so you can stand up and walk around.

144
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:43,365
Oh, yeah?

145
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,375
Ha-ha, it's true!

146
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:50,375
This is terrific!

147
00:15:53,555 --> 00:15:55,545
Oh, that must be it.

148
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,155
All right, there it is.

149
00:15:59,955 --> 00:16:03,895
Let's see... This is the glue, huh?

150
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:11,095
Let's see, the course
deviation caused by that damage is...

151
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:16,905
Oh, what's this?!

152
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:26,575
All right, that does it.
It was easier than I thought.

153
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:31,985
Goku, this is bad! You have to
make a course correction right now!

154
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:37,955
Goku, your position right
now is at SU-83 by 643-XY.

155
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:39,655
If you keep going the way you are,

156
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:45,165
you're going to collide
with the star Alpha HZ at 653-XY.

157
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,935
I can't understand anything as
complicated as that! What should I do?!

158
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:54,305
Oh, just do as I instruct
you to, and it will be easy.

159
00:16:54,345 --> 00:16:57,515
Hurry and get back inside the spaceship.

160
00:16:57,555 --> 00:16:59,515
All right, you got it.

161
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:00,885
Huh?

162
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:07,495
I'm stuck here. Come on, now!

163
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:14,965
This is bad. I can't get loose.

164
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:17,335
All right, one more time...

165
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:30,975
Goku, what are you doing? There's no time!

166
00:17:31,015 --> 00:17:33,545
That's easy for you to say,

167
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:37,155
but my feet got stuck with
the glue, and I can't get free!

168
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:39,355
What did you say?!

169
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,335
What do I do?!

170
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,335
Tell me!

171
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:53,335
G-Goku!

172
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,365
Goku<i>-san</i>!

173
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:07,855
I don't want to die out here!

174
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:15,525
All right, all I can do now is count on this...

175
00:18:15,565 --> 00:18:18,925
<i>Ka... me...</i>

176
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:22,925
<i>ha... me...</i>

177
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:27,305
<i>Ha!</i>

178
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:34,075
Whew! This is incredible power!

179
00:18:34,115 --> 00:18:37,445
I get it, this is the
result of the twenty G training!

180
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,485
He did it! He did it!

181
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:52,455
I-It's no use!

182
00:18:52,495 --> 00:18:54,295
Goku<i>-san</i>!

183
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:02,305
All right, I'm sure of myself now.
This time, full power!

184
00:19:02,345 --> 00:19:05,905
<i>Ka... me...</i>

185
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:11,315
<i>ha... me...</i>

186
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:15,285
<i>Ha!</i>

187
00:19:32,975 --> 00:19:37,305
He did it! He did it! He did it!

188
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:47,245
That much force from twenty Gs.

189
00:19:47,285 --> 00:19:50,255
If I raise the Gs even more,
I'll become even stronger!

190
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:11,435
I feel it! Larger-size powers!
They number about twenty.

191
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:14,505
No question about it, it's a Namekian village.

192
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:17,515
They probably have one of the Dragon Balls.

193
00:20:20,525 --> 00:20:23,485
Freeza and his men don't have Scouters!

194
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:28,355
No matter what action I may
take now, they won't know about it!

195
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:40,905
Sure enough. And since
the villagers are still alive,

196
00:20:40,945 --> 00:20:44,575
that proves that Freeza and
the others haven't been here yet!

197
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:58,855
W-What's this?

198
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:01,085
It's an alien!

199
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:07,425
Is the one called Elder here? I've come
to take your Dragon Ball off your hands.

200
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,695
W-What?

201
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:18,435
I am the Elder. Would you tell
me why you want the Dragon Balls?

202
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:22,445
Never mind, just hand it over
quickly. You have it, don't you?

203
00:21:22,485 --> 00:21:29,915
Leave us. I cannot allow you
to have it. I can sense evil in you.

204
00:21:32,895 --> 00:21:34,655
Then die.

205
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:40,495
Bang!

206
00:21:42,505 --> 00:21:44,125
Elder!

207
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:12,295
<i>Planet Namek was in the worst of circumstances.</i>

208
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:17,465
<i>At length, Vegeta had also set</i>
<i>out in search of the Dragon Balls.</i>

209
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:22,445
<i>Is their only hope to await the arrival of Goku?</i>

210
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:48,625
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

211
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:54,465
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

212
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,845
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

213
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:05,345
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

214
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:11,855
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

215
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:15,955
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

216
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,455
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

217
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:22,095
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

218
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:29,575
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

219
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,705
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

220
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,505
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

221
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:39,545
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

222
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:45,215
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

223
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:47,385
<i>So sorry.</i>

224
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:52,525
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

225
00:23:55,265 --> 00:24:00,535
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

226
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:13,245
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

227
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:17,015
<i>This is awesome! Everyone has</i>
<i>arrived at your place, Kaio-sama?</i>

228
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,925
<i>Yamucha, Piccolo, Tenshinhan, and Chaozu.</i>

229
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:25,725
<i>They all want even tougher</i>
<i>training than what you went through.</i>

230
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,255
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

231
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:30,965
<i>"Courage Times One Hundred!</i>
<i>The Warriors Gathered Under Kaio."</i>

232
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:34,475
<i>I Io-Io-Io-love Piccolo-san!</i>

233
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,565
"Next time"
"Courage Times One Hundred!
The Warriors Gathered Under Kaio"
