<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,050
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,730

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,620

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,070
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,860

<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,880
<i>Majin Boo absorbed Goten,</i>
<i>Trunks, Piccolo, and Gohan,</i>

24
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,300
<i>obtaining intellect and power.</i>

25
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,810
<i>In order to save the Earth from Majin</i>
<i>Boo, Goku and Vegeta merged together,</i>

26
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,770
<i>becoming the ultra-warrior Vegetto.</i>

27
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,940
You and the Earth together can cease to exist!

28
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,910
<i>The battle between Majin Boo and</i>
<i>Vegetto reached an extreme in intensity!</i>

29
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,910
<i>Offensive and defensive sides</i>
<i>continued to switch back and forth,</i>

30
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,870
<i>and just as their two powers</i>
<i>seemed evenly matched,</i>

31
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,410
<i>from within an aura of</i>
<i>light appeared Super Vegetto!</i>

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,170
This is Super Vegetto!!

33
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,340
<i>"A Fissure Between Dimensions!!</i>
<i>Has Boo Snapped!?"</i>

34
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:37,020
Satan-<i>san</i>! Satan-<i>san</i>!

35
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,990
It's Satan-<i>san</i>'s shoe...

36
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,160
D-Don't tell me he fell from here...!

37
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,670
Satan-<i>san</i>!

38
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:13,890
Satan-<i>san</i>! Satan-<i>san</i>!

39
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,400
S-Satan-<i>san</i>?

40
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,820
I thought I was going to die!

41
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,870
Thank goodness, Satan-<i>san</i>! You're all right!

42
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,830
It'll take more than this to make me,
the strongest martial artist in the world,

43
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,000
Mister Satan, kick the bucket!

44
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,170
By the way, what happened to Majin Boo?

45
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:51,010
W-What?!

46
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,430
Super Vegetto, you say?

47
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,570
You don't seem to understand yet, huh?
I have absorbed three Saiyans–

48
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,860
the two half-pints, as well as Gohan!

49
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,740
Now that you have combined
together and become a Super Saiyan,

50
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,830
what is that supposed to do for you?!

51
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,460
You're the one who doesn't understand.

52
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,750
Merging via the Potara
is not that simple a matter.

53
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,300
Hmph, of course, you probably wouldn't
understand if I explain it to you verbally.

54
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,840
I'll show you.

55
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,800
You're right! If you can't
understand something you're told,

56
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,020
all that's left is to make you
understand by force! You miserable fool!

57
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,270
The likes of you...!

58
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,810
What about "the likes of me"?

59
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,520
Your nose is bleeding.

60
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,700
It's disgraceful. Hurry and wipe it off.

61
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,670
The more you make me angry, the
more you're going to suffer and die!

62
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,830
Have you understood that?

63
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,480
Goku-<i>san</i>! Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

64
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:39,090
Hmph! Didn't feel that at all. I wish
you'd take this a little more seriously.

65
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:45,850
Inflicting damage is done like this...

66
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:02,030
Y-You're not...!

67
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,040
Big Bang...

68
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,080
...Attack!!

69
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,840
He did it!

70
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,680
Take that!

71
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,300
Satan-<i>san</i>...!

72
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,590
How was that? I bet you felt that!

73
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,030
That didn't hurt...

74
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,950
That did not hurt!

75
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,770
How about this? Can you see me, I wonder?

76
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,730
Nah, I can't see you. However...

77
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,330
W-What?

78
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,750
The important thing to grasp
is strength and movement of <i>ki.</i>

79
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,340
You follow me with your eyes, which is
why you can't keep up with my motions.

80
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,420
Y-You think you're so great!

81
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,740
He's so strong! To think
that Majin Boo is so helpless!

82
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,280
I never thought the Potara
union could be so incredible!

83
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,700
What are you so carried away for, you moron?

84
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,830
It's only because those
two did it that it's gone so far.

85
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,630
You've got two of the three greatest experts,

86
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,340
from This World and the Next World
combined, merged together, after all.

87
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,050
Moreover, you've got
two rivals teamed together.

88
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,930
That's obviously going to be what's strongest!

89
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:10,350
Under the circumstances, something
like that doesn't really matter, does it?

90
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,140
In any case, now the Earth–no,
the whole universe, will be saved!

91
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,850
How unsightly.

92
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,290
Awesome! This is really awesome!

93
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,420
Majin Boo there is no match for him at all!

94
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:29,680
Thinking ahead just in case, I requested
Yama-<i>sama</i> to leave you with your bodies,

95
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,010
but it seems you won't get your turns.

96
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,260
Get our turns nothing,

97
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,390
if our opponent is someone that
Goku and Vegeta couldn't handle,

98
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,850
there's no way we could win, is there?

99
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,600
That is true...

100
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,520
Hold on... if we don't get a turn... *ulp*!

101
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,030
Are we going to lose our bodies
and be turned into ordinary spirits?

102
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,990
You don't have to worry.

103
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,370
As with Goku, you are warriors who
saved Earth from crises countless times.

104
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:03,000
I will ask the Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i> to
allow you to train here like Goku does.

105
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,840
Thank you very much, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

106
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,840
Yamucha, good news... huh?

107
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,590
Yamucha? Yamucha?!

108
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,770
W-What are you doing?

109
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,820
This place is incredible!

110
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,740
There are strong guys like
I've never seen before all over!

111
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,950
My blood, which has been inactive,
is boiling hot for the first time in years!

112
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,590
And here, when he was alive, he had given
it up completely, and hadn't even trained...

113
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,150
What's the matter? You've
gotten awfully quiet, haven't you?

114
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,530
You know something, this isn't any fun at all.

115
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,450
I wish you would take this more seriously.

116
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,920
Or perhaps you have been
serious, and this is how it turned out.

117
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,580
In that case, it was rude of me to say
that, and I was out of line. I apologize.

118
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,170
Why, you...!

119
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:03,000
Y-You laughed at me!

120
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,160
A mere man such as you...!

121
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,360
What's this?

122
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,620
How about that? I've entered
inside your own body!

123
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,620
No matter how powered-up you may become,

124
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,040
I doubt there's anything
you can do about this!

125
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,170
Prepare yourself! I'm going to
destroy your body from the inside!

126
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,560
You're the one who
should be preparing yourself.

127
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,930
What?!

128
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,590
W-Why?! Why can't I move like I want to?

129
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,010
It's only natural. I've bottled up
your movements with my <i>ki</i>, after all.

130
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,220
As long as you're inside my body,
you cannot move freely.

131
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,020
What are you going to do?
You want to continue?

132
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,500
You are one distasteful creep!

133
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,500
And yet, with all those
many guys you've merged with,

134
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,340
if that's all you've got, I'm fairly disappointed.

135
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:59,590
Disappointed, you say?

136
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,010
In me? In me, the strongest in the universe?!

137
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,470
That's enough of you making a fool out of me!

138
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,870
Make a fool out of me, will you?

139
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,710
Me...?! Me...?!

140
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,230
Incredible power! You can
manage it if you just try, can't you?

141
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,770
You'll pay for that!

142
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,620
You can't! You mustn't
anger Majin Boo any further!

143
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,450
What do you mean?

144
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:15,080
There was a time when Majin Boo was
sealed up in the Room of Spirit and Time.

145
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,540
I can't stand this!!

146
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,390
Mad with anger, Majin Boo used his power

147
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:35,810
to break through the wall between
dimensions, and then came out.

148
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,610
Look at this, if you would.

149
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,450
Having forgotten himself in anger, the
extreme power radiating from Majin Boo

150
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,910
is causing the space surrounding him to warp!

151
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:55,160
At this rate, the walls between
dimensions will break down,

152
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,960
and other dimensions will rush through!

153
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,790
That would be awful.

154
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,340
Make a fool out of me, will you?
Make a fool out of me, will you?!

155
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:23,400
This is bad! He's gotten completely fired up!

156
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,280
If I don't stop him, this universe will
be crushed by alternate dimensions!

157
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,900
What the hell happened to me...?

158
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,950
That was close, that was close!
You sure do have awesome power, huh?

159
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,410
In which case, use that power to come hit me!

160
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,540
You were going to defeat
me as proof to all, right?

161
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,870
That you are the strongest in the universe?

162
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,050
Why the hell is he taking so long?!

163
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,720
Hurry up and defeat Majin Boo!

164
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,600
<i>Ultra powers clash</i>
<i>between Majin Boo and Vegetto.</i>

165
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,520
<i>Will the one who decides</i>
<i>this fierce battle be Vegetto?</i>

166
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,400
<i>Or will it be Majin Boo?</i>

167
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,990
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

168
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,580
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

169
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,180
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

170
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,270
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

171
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:09,270
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

172
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,650
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

173
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,530
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

174
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:27,580
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

175
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,130
<i>Even now?</i>

176
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:36,760
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

177
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,180
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

178
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,650
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

179
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:58,700
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

180
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,010
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

181
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,220
<i>Hey, now, what's the matter, Majin Boo?</i>

182
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,680
<i>I could beat you with just my feet.</i>

183
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,100
<i>You fool!</i>

184
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,730
<i>Nothing good can come of you</i>
<i>holding your power back, Vegetto!</i>

185
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,900
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

186
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,320
<i>"The Ace Up Boo's Sleeve!!</i>
<i>'You Become a Hard Candy'!"</i>

187
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,320
<i>Father, you can't let Boo</i>
<i>sucker punch you like that!</i>

188
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,780
"Next time"
"The Ace Up Boo's Sleeve!!
'You Become a Hard Candy'!"
