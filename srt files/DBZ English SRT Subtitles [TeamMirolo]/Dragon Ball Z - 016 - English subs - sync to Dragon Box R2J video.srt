Big Brother...

21
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,470
Mm-hmm, this one's dead.

22
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,640
Really?

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,470
You can tell if he's
dead or not by doing that?

24
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,610
Of course you can! You're five already,
and you don't even know that?

25
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,020
I did so know!

26
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,890
It doesn't look like he's
carrying anything worth any money.

27
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,050
Big Brother, over there!

28
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,260
All right, we will reap something!

29
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,530
Awesome!

30
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,740
That's mine...

31
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,080
Did he die again?

32
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,050
He doesn't look injured, huh?

33
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,580
You're right.

34
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,990
He's coming around.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,360
–Um...
–I'm Rom. Nice to meet you.

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,930
I'm his sister, Chiko. Who are you?

37
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,260
I'm Son Gohan.

38
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,800
–How old are you?
–Four.

39
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,600
Hooray! You're younger than me!

40
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,240
Where are we?

41
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,040
This is our cottage.

42
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,840
Not bad, huh?
Where did you come from?

43
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,410
I don't know. I think it
was a desert somewhere.

44
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,620
Well, no matter. In any case,
as of today, you're one of us.

45
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,560
It might be rough, but
don't cry, the way Chiko does.

46
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,060
"Mom! Where have you gone?!"

47
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't cry anymore!

48
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,600
Um, I...

49
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,600
Listen, from now on,
you have to call me Big Sister.

50
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,840
There's no need to be shy.

51
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,780
Without any parents,
we all have to help each other.

52
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:50,510
What's the matter? If you want
to tell us something, speak up.

53
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:54,620
I'm sorry. It's been a long
time since I talked to anyone.

54
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,560
I can't speak that well.

55
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,610
About two years ago,
there was this gigantic tsunami.

56
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,680
It swallowed up the whole city!

57
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,690
It was scary!

58
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,490
This place is packed with
kids like us that don't have homes.

59
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,670
Um, but I...

60
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,350
Uh-oh, they're making their regular stop.

61
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,020
Regular stop?

62
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,550
Uh-huh! Hurry!

63
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,060
Hurry! They'll catch you!

64
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,080
Wait here. Once I take
Chiko across, I'll be right back for you.

65
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,520
Come on...

66
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:35,010
Take that! You guys can't catch us!

67
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,450
Dammit!

68
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,620
They make sure to come here once every day.

69
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,820
Who are they?

70
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,150
The guys from the institution.

71
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,820
They're trying to catch
us and toss us in the pokey.

72
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,190
Is that a scary place?

73
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,830
According to the folks
who escaped from there,

74
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,970
they were picked on every day,
and got smacked with slippers.

75
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,140
You can't come out of there for
the rest of your life, that's for sure.

76
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,540
On top of that, they
cut your nails every night!

77
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,780
Let go of me! No! Oww!

78
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,150
Stop it! You're hurting me, I tell you!

79
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,820
Piegero!

80
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,630
She doesn't want to go. Cut it out!

81
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,660
You again?! Come on, now!

82
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,210
Why, you–!

83
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,270
Stop that!

84
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,540
You children up in the tree, come on down here!

85
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,280
If you do, you'll get new clothes,
a clean room, and a hot meal!

86
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,050
Really?

87
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,910
Dummy! Don't be fooled!

88
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,450
We don't want any of that! Get out of here!

89
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:26,190
So then, do you plan to go on
living in a place like this forever?

90
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,860
You think we're about to
put ourselves in your care?!

91
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,590
We'll go on living by ourselves just fine!

92
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,430
Yeah! Yeah! Get out
of here! Get out of here!

93
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,130
Get out of here!
Get out of here!

94
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,610
Yay! And don't come back!

95
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,550
We have a new kid?

96
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,320
Apparently, he got shipwrecked
out at sea, and washed up here.

97
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,320
I'm Son Gohan. Nice to meet you.

98
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,560
Hey, this boy is still little, so
give him a comparable share of food.

99
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,390
Look who's talking.
The same goes for you, doesn't it?

100
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,760
I guess so.

101
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,840
Well, anyhow, as a fellow person
without any family, let's stick together.

102
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,230
Come on over,
come on over! Delicious stuff!

103
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,860
Welcome by, son.
I'll let you have them cheap.

104
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,240
Yow!

105
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,670
Yow-ow-ow-ow!

106
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,070
What's the matter, son?

107
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,240
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

108
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,250
–All right, now!
–Okay.

109
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,080
It hurts! It hurts!

110
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,080
What's the matter?

111
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,050
It hurts! It hurts!

112
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,050
It hurts!

113
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,620
Where does it hurt?

114
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,220
It hurts!

115
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,630
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

116
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,230
So, it's you guys! Hold it!

117
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,230
It hurts!

118
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,240
You bastards!

119
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,670
Hold it!

120
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,580
You hold it!

121
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,410
Dammit!

122
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,590
Thieves!

123
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,490
Hey, you!

124
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,300
Hold it!

125
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,240
Take that!

126
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,270
Why, you–! Hey!

127
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,270
See? That was pretty fun, wasn't it?

128
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,640
Uh-huh!

129
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,940
Even without parents, children still grow up!

130
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,940
Yeah, yeah!

131
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,140
Well said! We're growing up fine, huh?

132
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:08,980
What's the matter?

133
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,320
Hmm? Nothing.

134
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,350
What's the matter? Need to pee?

135
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,050
What are you doing?

136
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,720
Standing watch. We've been
causing trouble all over, after all.

137
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,230
Sometimes there are people
that come after us at night here.

138
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,290
What is it, if you didn't
come out here to pee?

139
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm not an orphan. I have a mother,
and I was actually on my way home to her.

140
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,580
Oh, so the little boy has a home, huh?

141
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,250
I'm sorry, I just couldn't say anything.

142
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:55,080
There's nothing you have to apologize for.

143
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,090
I guess I jumped to the wrong conclusion.

144
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,750
Where is your home?

145
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,160
In a bamboo grove on Mount Paozu.

146
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,760
Mount Paozu? That's pretty far, huh?

147
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,330
–You know it?
–Yeah.

148
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,930
Please tell me the way, if you would!

149
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,930
You got it. I'll show you tomorrow.

150
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,130
Thanks!

151
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,740
Say, is your mom nice?

152
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,640
I wouldn't say that.

153
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,510
Everyday, she tells me to study,
study, and it gets annoying.

154
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,740
Being annoying is okay,
as long as she's around.

155
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,980
Yeah, yeah!

156
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,510
Do you go to school?

157
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,750
I go to a cram school.

158
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,150
Do you like to study?

159
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,150
There's stuff I like, and stuff I don't like.

160
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:37,330
Yeah, yeah, that's right, huh? I hate
gym and math, but art is my best subject!

161
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,330
For me, it's science.

162
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,330
–What about you, Ena?
–I've never been to school.

163
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,330
Oh, that's right. The tsunami
happened before Ena started school.

164
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,100
Do you guys... want to go to school?

165
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,040
Not especially. Who needs studying?

166
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,020
If you go to the institution,
you can do all you like.

167
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,210
No way, that place smells like medicine!

168
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,720
Yeah, that goes for me, too. No way.

169
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,590
And someone who's
escaped from there ought to know!

170
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,160
I know! How about we all
drive to Gohan's house tomorrow?

171
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:09,720
Cool!

172
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,170
That will be fun! Let's go, let's go!

173
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,000
Not yet?

174
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,970
Not yet.

175
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,340
They're late today.

176
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,610
Maybe they've given up.

177
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,450
They're coming, they're coming! Here they come!

178
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,750
Hey, wait!

179
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,750
Hurry up!

180
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,230
O-Oh, no!

181
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,990
Hey, get out!

182
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,320
Ow! Ow!

183
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,750
Chiko!

184
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,480
Come quietly!

185
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,580
Damn!

186
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,320
Gohan, this way!

187
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,320
But everyone else is–!

188
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,620
Just come on!

189
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,320
–Piegero!
–Gohan!

190
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,160
Piegero!

191
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
What are you doing?!

192
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,330
Hey, you!

193
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,400
Piegero!

194
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,340
Why?! Huh?

195
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,750
Why?! Why did you do that?!

196
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,410
Why?!

197
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,220
It's for the best! They're still...

198
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,520
...just little kids...
and already they're delinquents.

199
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,260
They're too young for that!

200
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:38,170
You're no ordinary kid, huh?
You're incredibly strong.

201
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,330
Are you going back there?

202
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:45,610
No. There's nobody there, even if I
did go back. See ya. Respect your mom.

203
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,940
Thanks, Piegero<i>-san.</i>

204
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,250
<i>Say, is your mom nice?</i>

205

206

<i>Respect your mom.</i>

207
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,750
What is your mission?!

208
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,340
Say it!

209
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,510
To defeat the Saiyans, and to save...

210
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,510
...the Earth!

211
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,450
We're going back!

212
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,790
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>

214

<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

221

<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

222
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,740

<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

224
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:45,450
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

225
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,620
<i>So sorry.</i>

226

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:24,790
