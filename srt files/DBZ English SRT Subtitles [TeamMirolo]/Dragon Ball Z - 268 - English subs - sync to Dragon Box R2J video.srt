<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,105
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:41,735
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:49,035
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:54,745
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:11,685

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

Here, put one of these Potara on your left ear.

24
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:58,685
<i>Having obtained the Potara earrings,</i>

25
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:01,945
<i>mysterious items used for</i>

Everything...

28
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,245
...be gone!!

29
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:12,745
I-I'm sorry, Majin Boo!

30
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:40,015
W-Why, you...!

31
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:51,115
Gohan! Here!

32
00:02:57,575 --> 00:02:59,075
Here it is!

33
00:03:13,465 --> 00:03:15,265
D-Dammit, no!

34
00:03:20,015 --> 00:03:23,815
<i>However, Majin Boo absorbed Gohan!</i>

35
00:03:27,645 --> 00:03:32,025
This is great! I'm much
more powered-up than before!

36

<i>"Merged!! Vegeta's Pride And Goku's Rage."</i>

37
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:09,695
So, what will you do?!

38
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:15,325
I have taken the Son Gohan
you wanted to merge with first!

39
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:24,035
What should I do?

40
00:04:25,585 --> 00:04:28,545
Damn, what should I do?

41
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:32,925
There is nobody anywhere
left for you to merge with!

42
00:04:34,595 --> 00:04:40,055
Th-That was dirty, Boo, absorbing everyone!

43
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:46,565
Winning is everything,
just as it must be for you.

44
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:48,145
Damn you...!

45
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:51,565
Well now, it's nothing
to get so despondent over.

46
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,075
I'll put you out of your misery soon enough.

47
00:04:54,115 --> 00:04:57,495
You will only suffer for a little bit!

48
00:04:57,535 --> 00:05:01,705
H-Hey, why is Majin Boo still alive?

49
00:05:03,205 --> 00:05:10,585
Th-This is bad. I don't have any bullets
left in my pistol. I can't finish him off!

50
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,175
Y-You don't say.

51
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:18,715
I am kind at heart, and will give
you a chance to merge with someone.

52
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:25,475
You have until I count to five to decide
which one of them you will merge with. Got it?

53
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:31,895
One!

54
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:39,745
Two!

55
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:59,885
<i>D-Dende ain't a fighting type.</i>

56
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,135
<i>Even if I do merge with him,</i>
<i>it won't mean any more power.</i>

57
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,975
Three!

58
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,785
<i>I-It's no use!</i>

59
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:27,625
<i>With Satan, it would be like a power</i>
<i>of 1000 rising to a power of 1001,</i>

60
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:29,755
<i>and we couldn't beat him!</i>

61
00:06:29,795 --> 00:06:33,045
<i>Or worse, if I'm unlucky, I could</i>
<i>even become weaker, couldn't I?</i>

62
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:37,385
Four!

63
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:45,305
<i>Damn! It's all or nothing!</i>

64
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:49,815
Satan!

65
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:53,025
Catch...

66
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,815
...this!

67
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:59,065
<i>That ki...!</i>

68
00:07:00,195 --> 00:07:02,905
<i>I-It's a huge ki! It couldn't be...!</i>

69
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,835
Th-This is as far as I bring you.

70
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,755
I'm sorry it's a bit distant, but I'm too scared!

71
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:24,055
Hmph. Don't worry about it.

72
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:29,095
It will just mean my getting killed
by Majin Boo will come a little later.

73
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:34,145
Five!

74
00:07:34,185 --> 00:07:36,735
I-It's Vegeta!

75
00:07:36,775 --> 00:07:40,155
What's the matter? Have you
given up on combining with someone?

76
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:43,745
In that case, die right now!!

77
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:45,115
Lucky!

78
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,505
Instantaneous Movement, huh?

79
00:07:54,545 --> 00:07:56,795
–Okay then, be careful!
–Yeah.

80
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:01,175
Vegeta!

81
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,595
All right! It really is you!

82
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:05,595
K-Kakarrot!

83
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,095
G-Goku!

84
00:08:07,135 --> 00:08:08,555
Hey!

85
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:11,105
W-Why are you here?!

86
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:17,735
You aren't supposed to return to
this world again! This can't be possible!

87
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:20,115
V-Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

88
00:08:20,155 --> 00:08:26,115
Good timing! If he combines with that
man, something could just turn out!

89
00:08:26,155 --> 00:08:29,745
W-Why is Vegeta-<i>san</i> there?

90
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:32,625
Everyone who goes to hell is
supposed to have their souls cleansed,

91
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:37,125
have their memories taken away,
and become a new life form.

92
00:08:37,165 --> 00:08:41,135
This is Great King Yama's doing!

93
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:45,425
He might have a blank look about him,
but when he does something, he really does it!

94
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:57,065
Does he think he can escape me?

95
00:08:57,105 --> 00:09:02,315
Be it under the ground, or another planet,
I will pursue you, no matter how far!

96
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,525
Until I have squeezed the life from you!

97
00:09:10,205 --> 00:09:12,165
He's gone!

98
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:15,295
H-Hey, that man named Goku or whatever

99
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:18,505
looked like he was planning
on giving me something.

100
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:19,755
What could it have been?

101
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:22,255
I-It doesn't matter now!

102
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,595
Never mind that, I'm going to go
after them and see what happens!

103
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:29,595
W-Whoa, please, take
me too! I hate to be alone!

104
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,885
I won't let you go!

105
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:36,855
W-W-What does this mean?!

106
00:09:36,895 --> 00:09:42,155
What's more, the ring over your
head is gone! You've come back to life!

107
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,525
Oh, this? There's this old guy,

108
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:49,155
the Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama,</i>
who exchanged his life so that I...

109
00:10:00,085 --> 00:10:05,675
We'll talk later. Majin Boo is
coming this way at ultra-speed!

110
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:07,675
Ba-<i>chan</i>, hurry and run
away to the Other World!

111
00:10:08,715 --> 00:10:11,845
Y-You're right! Good luck, the both of you!

112
00:10:11,885 --> 00:10:14,935
I'll be pulling for you in the Other World!

113
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:20,645
I thought you'd already been wiped out in hell!

114
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:25,565
Yama-<i>sama</i> sure did something crafty,
to leave you the way you were, didn't he?

115
00:10:29,525 --> 00:10:34,535
There ain't time! Vegeta, don't talk,
just put this on your right ear! Please!

116
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:37,495
Why?

117
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:42,085
If you put this on too, then
you and I can merge together!

118
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,085
Merge?

119
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:46,045
That's right! Our powers
will be multiplied together,

120
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:49,545
and a warrior with absurd power will be born!

121
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,395
Don't be ridiculous! How can I believe that?

122
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:58,565
V-Vegeta!

123
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:03,445
There's another person
there with a large power!

124
00:11:03,485 --> 00:11:05,445
However, naturally, they're no match for me!

125
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:08,615
Even if they were to combine together!

126
00:11:08,655 --> 00:11:14,075
Vegeta! There ain't nothing else we
can do, if we're going to beat Majin Boo!

127
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:17,035
Why should I have to unite with you?!

128
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:20,625
If I'm to become one with you,
I'd rather be wiped out!

129
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:43,485
I've found you!

130
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,525
H-He's here!

131
00:11:47,695 --> 00:11:51,025
Stop it, Vegeta! You're simply no match for him!

132
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:56,665
Please! Put this on!

133
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:59,665
I refuse! It's the same, no
matter how many times you say it!

134
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:05,665
Move it!

135
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,545
All right, come on!

136
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,585
You, huh? We've fought before.

137
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:54,545
No matter what, you are no match for me!

138
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:02,265
<i>Tenshinhan-san!</i>

139
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:05,065
<i>Tenshinhan-san...!</i>

140
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,615
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>!

141
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:21,785
Dende? Thanks. Where's Goku?

142
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:25,745
Where's Majin Boo?

143
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:29,165
He's gone, with his Instantaneous Movement.

144
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,755
Boo then chased after him.

145
00:13:31,795 --> 00:13:32,755
I see...

146
00:13:32,795 --> 00:13:36,095
W-What's this? Another trick?

147
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:43,185
What's the matter? Have you chickened out?

148
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:45,565
Vegeta! This is insane!

149
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:51,485
Majin Boo is far, far more powered
up than when you fought him before!

150
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:58,535
Hmph! I know that he has tremendous strength!

151
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:02,155
Even so, is there any way I can give up?!

152
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:09,085
So long as there is an opponent
before my eyes, I will fight him!

153
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:14,005
I am the proud prince of the Saiyans!

154
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:20,515
The warrior race Saiyan prince!

155
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,505
Dammit!

156
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:55,005
Stop, Vegeta!

157
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,235
Ah, hell!

158
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:27,705
Damn it all!

159
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:44,095
Even the two of you
together cannot stand up to me!

160
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:04,235
D-Damn...

161
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,175
Stop it, Vegeta!

162
00:16:17,215 --> 00:16:19,255
No matter how many times we
try this, we're no match for him!

163
00:16:19,295 --> 00:16:21,755
There really ain't
anything to do but combine!

164
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:29,635
Vegeta! Please! Put this Potara on!

165
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:37,735
Vegeta!

166
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:39,565
No!

167
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:42,115
Vegeta-<i>san</i>! Goku-<i>san</i>!

168
00:16:42,155 --> 00:16:46,115
There's no other way to defeat Majin
Boo except to quickly merge together!

169
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:49,615
What in the world are they doing?

170
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:52,665
Is it that they don't
get along with each other?

171
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:07,135
I suppose that under these rocks
would be a good place for them to die.

172
00:17:07,175 --> 00:17:11,145
Please, Vegeta! This ain't
the time to be particular! Okay?

173
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:15,145
It will be the end for everything!

174
00:17:15,185 --> 00:17:18,565
You irritate me!

175
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:21,655
Earlier, when you were fighting with me,

176
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:26,575
you hid the fact that you
had an even higher power!

177
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:28,615
I was watching from the Other World!

178
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:33,585
What is this Super Saiyan 3?!
You were toying with me!

179
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:36,585
You really grate on my nerves!

180
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,755
How am I supposed to
merge with someone like you?!

181
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:48,765
I'm sorry. The time I can transform
into Super Saiyan 3 is limited.

182
00:17:48,805 --> 00:17:50,635
Your excuses don't matter!

183
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:54,685
It doesn't change the fact that when
you fought me, you were holding back!

184
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:58,475
I have been made a fool of!

185
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:01,525
This fighting between
yourselves is getting all too annoying!

186
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:05,865
If you're not going to
come at me, then I'll go at you!

187
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:29,715
Dammit!

188
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:31,515
All right! Now!

189
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:13,055
It's hopeless! No matter
what we do, we can't win!

190
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:19,105
The Earth and everything
else are going to be blown away!

191
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,105
It's the end of everything!

192
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,105
Hmph! Do I care?!

193
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:31,115
Vegeta, everyone was eaten by Boo!
Including Kuririn, and Chichi...

194
00:19:31,155 --> 00:19:33,115
...and Bulma too!

195
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:41,125
Piccolo too, and Gohan, Goten, and
even Trunks were absorbed by that guy!

196
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:46,125
That's what Boo's sudden power-up is due to!

197
00:19:46,165 --> 00:19:49,595
Everyone will have died for nothing like this!

198
00:19:49,635 --> 00:19:54,845
We're going to be killed here,
without being able to offer any resistance!

199
00:20:30,715 --> 00:20:32,885
Is that okay with you, Vegeta?!

200
00:20:41,725 --> 00:20:44,105
Kakarrot!

201
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:47,485
If we merge, will we really
be able to win against Boo?

202
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:53,065
I don't know. All that's certain is
that we will become incredibly strong!

203
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:03,665
It's about time I put you out of your misery!

204
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:05,165
Give it to me! Quickly!

205
00:21:07,705 --> 00:21:11,045
Stop dawdling! Hurry up!

206
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:13,175
Vegeta! Here!

207
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:18,055
I'm done playing with you!

208
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:20,685
Dammit! It was the right ear, right?

209
00:21:20,725 --> 00:21:24,515
Vegeta! I'll tell you now,
once we merge together,

210
00:21:24,555 --> 00:21:28,065
we can never return to being
two people again! Got that?

211
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:34,655
W-What was that?! Dammit,
tell me at the last second, will you?

212
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:38,075
This is the end!

213
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:40,495
This is okay then, right?

214
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:42,365
Thank you, Vegeta!

215
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:18,075
All right, then!

216
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:23,785
<i>At last, Goku and Vegeta have merged!</i>

217
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:28,995
<i>And so, the ultimate clash of</i>
<i>the mightiest is about to begin!</i>

218
00:22:33,415 --> 00:22:38,005
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

219
00:22:39,755 --> 00:22:44,595
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

220
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:55,155
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

221
00:22:55,195 --> 00:23:01,285
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

222
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:08,285
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

223
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:13,665
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

224
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:17,505
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

225
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:26,595
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

226
00:23:26,635 --> 00:23:28,145
<i>Even now?</i>

227
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:35,775
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

228
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:41,195
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

229
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:47,665
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

230
00:23:47,705 --> 00:23:57,675
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

231
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:14,935
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

232
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,605
<i>It looks like we managed to</i>
<i>successfully merge together.</i>

233
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:19,905
<i>What's more, our power</i>
<i>is beyond imagination.</i>

234
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:22,235
<i>Don't get too carried away with yourself.</i>

235
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:26,495
<i>You think that joining together</i>
<i>is all it will take to defeat me?!</i>

236
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:28,665
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

237
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:32,165
<i>"Magnificent Power!!</i>
<i>Vegetto Surpasses the Ultimate."</i>

238
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:36,165
<i>No one is a match for Father and Vegeta now!</i>

239
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:38,795
"Next time"
"Magnificent Power!!
Vegetto Surpasses the Ultimate"
