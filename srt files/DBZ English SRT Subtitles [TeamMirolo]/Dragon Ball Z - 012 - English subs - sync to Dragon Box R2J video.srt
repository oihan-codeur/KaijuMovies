Father...

30
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:17,185
All right, I've decided. I think
I'll go back to where Mother is.

31
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:29,365
Ain't I gotten to... Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s place yet?

32
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:41,345
I wonder if Goku has
arrived at Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s place

33
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:43,825
and is getting his training yet.

34
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:47,655
Uranai Baba<i>-sama</i> told us that
even once we gather the Dragon Balls,

35
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:50,685
not to bring him back to life for a year.

36
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:55,655
Mmm... And one year is right
about the time when those Saiyan guys

37
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,895
are supposed to arrive here on Earth.

38
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:03,165
I wonder if he'll be able to
defend Earth against the Saiyans.

39
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,185
Bulma<i>-san</i>, aren't we there yet?

40
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:21,785
There's no doubt that he's
along this direction somewhere...

41
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:26,185
We have to find Tenshinhan<i>-san</i> and
them quickly, and climb up Karin-to Tower.

42
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,825
Yamucha<i>-san</i> might
already have arrived there.

43
00:05:29,865 --> 00:05:32,855
Earth's fate is in the balance.

44
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:52,605
Hey! It's time to eat!

45
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:58,085
Come quick, Tenshinhan! I've got
some top-notch cooking ready for you!

46
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:13,995
Ten<i>-san</i>, it's incredible!

47
00:07:14,035 --> 00:07:16,095
How is it that there's so much?

48
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,135
I hired these guys
to make it all, of course!

49
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:24,975
I had nothing but first-rate
ingredients brought together! Right?

50
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,145
Must have cost some money.

51
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:31,145
Don't worry. I just finished a pretty good job.

52
00:07:31,185 --> 00:07:35,685
By the way, Tenshinhan, how long
are you planning on doing all this?

53
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:38,355
Until Ten<i>-san</i> beats Son Goku.

54
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:41,955
Cut it out, cut it out.
Things are peaceful now.

55
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:44,365
There's no use in getting any stronger.

56
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:48,835
And for that matter, you're strong
enough as it is in the first place.

57
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,395
I am not so strong.

58
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:55,675
When I met Son, I learned
that the world was a large place.

59
00:07:55,715 --> 00:08:01,115
And it's not just Son, there's sure to be
other strong guys out there in the world.

60
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:03,055
That is why I train.

61
00:08:05,655 --> 00:08:08,015
How about, instead, you team up with me

62
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:11,155
and we hold up banks or something?
We could make a real bundle!

63
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:14,955
If we did, then you could eat as
much of this delicious stuff as you want!

64
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,995
After all, from now on, money is everything!

65
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:21,265
Money talks in this world! As long
as we have money, we'll be happy!

66
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,005
Aren't you eating?

67
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,165
Ten<i>-san</i>, let's eat up!

68
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,035
That's more like it! There's
no need for you to hold back!

69
00:08:29,075 --> 00:08:31,005
Go on, baldy, chow down!

70
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:32,175
R-Right.

71
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:36,015
Y'know, Tenshinhan,
holding up banks is fun!

72
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:39,215
Just by shooting off your
gun, everybody gets the jitters!

73
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:43,985
Yeah, let's do it!
If you teamed up with me,

74
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:47,365
there's nothing we'd have
to fear! We'd be invincible!

75
00:08:50,565 --> 00:08:52,435
Chaozu, training!

76
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,565
He's really got himself a hard head.

77
00:08:57,605 --> 00:09:00,475
Ten<i>-san</i> can even break rocks with his head!

78
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:06,045
That's not what I meant... you stupid bastard!

79
00:09:07,615 --> 00:09:09,915
I-I didn't mean it!

80
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:22,395
<i>Son, just what sort of</i>
<i>training are you doing?</i>

81
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:44,285
<i>–Oni?</i>
–Hey there! What are you doing, Pops?

82
00:09:44,325 --> 00:09:45,945
What am I doing, <i>oni</i>?

83
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,855
I was asked by Great King
Yama<i>-sama</i> to clean this road <i>oni.</i>

84
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:53,925
I'm going to Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s place!

85
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,925
<i>Oni</i>?! You're going to Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s place?

86
00:09:56,965 --> 00:10:00,495
I've never seen a daredevil
dead person as big as you <i>oni</i>!

87
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,735
Is there still a long way to go?

88
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:05,635
Of course there is!
From what I've heard,

89
00:10:05,675 --> 00:10:09,805
you're still only about
halfway to the halfway point <i>oni.</i>

90
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:13,645
Still only halfway to halfway?!
It is pretty long then, huh?

91
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:17,145
<i>Oni</i>?

92
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:21,185
Hey, what's the matter <i>oni</i>?

93
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:24,615
I need a little break!

94
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,325
<i>Oni.</i>

95
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,465
If you want me to take you part
of the way, I can give you a ride <i>oni</i>!

96
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:35,165
Get on back of here <i>oni</i>!

97
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:38,005
Really? Yahoo!

98
00:10:38,045 --> 00:10:39,535
Ready, Pops!

99
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:41,515
All right, here we go <i>oni</i>!

100
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,675
Chaozu!

101
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:38,425
Ten<i>-san</i>, you did it!

102
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:41,695
No. I still have much
more to do than just this.

103
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,645
O-Oh, no!

104
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:55,135
<i>How could I have done that?</i>
<i>I messed up the control over my power.</i>

105
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:59,505
<i>At this rate, it will</i>
<i>reach where that kid is!</i>

106
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,045
Hang in there, hang in there!

107
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:08,775
T-This is a big one!
And I can't stand earthquakes!

108
00:15:10,685 --> 00:15:12,275
Tenshinhan!

109
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,495
Tenshinhan!

110
00:15:28,535 --> 00:15:29,935
Ten<i>-san</i>!

111
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:51,525
Ten<i>-san</i>!

112
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:01,235
I've located Tenshinhan!

113
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:09,235
Where the hell have you gone?!

114
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:50,345
I made it!

115
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,665
I'm cold!

116
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:22,535
Huh?

117
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:26,605
Oh, my! Have I done it again?

118
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:30,045
Apparently, he's within those mountains.

119
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:34,045
That's just the kind of place you'd
expect Tenshinhan<i>-san</i> to be training!

120
00:17:38,165 --> 00:17:41,425
I'm really sorry I've been a bother to you.

121
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:46,295
I'll go back to the Kame House for now.

122
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:50,365
That will be great. Please give
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i> my regards,

123
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:52,765
and tell him that we are continuing
to train as he would expect of us.

124
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,905
Yes, you certainly are.
Okay then, take care of yourselves.

125
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:59,245
–Be careful.
–Farewell!

126
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:08,255
Chaozu, now we can
devote ourselves to training.

127
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,265
She's an odd person.

128
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:27,675
Such pretty flowers!

129
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:35,975
They smell nice!

130
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,485
Stupid bastards! I've been
looking for you, you know!

131
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,325
You're trying to get rid
of me, but I won't have it!

132
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:29,065
Now cut out that stuff
already, and get over here!

133
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:34,105
Keep out of this!

134
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:37,535
B-Bullets?!

135
00:19:45,755 --> 00:19:49,785
I-Impossible! To think
that Son could have died!

136
00:19:51,465 --> 00:19:54,525
But Goku is training in the Other World.

137
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:58,665
And we need to be sure that we can
keep up when the two Saiyans get here.

138
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:01,765
Kami<i>-sama</i> is going to
be training you, after all!

139
00:20:01,805 --> 00:20:03,065
Ten<i>-san</i>!

140
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:06,065
It's something better than I could
have hoped for! We'll go immediately!

141
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,905
Ten<i>-san</i>, we can train!

142
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:10,275
What's more...

143
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:12,375
What is it, baldy?!

144
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,175
Hey, Tenshinhan...

145
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,915
If you're trying to run away
from me, I'm not about to let you.

146
00:20:19,955 --> 00:20:22,285
I don't care if you're going to
Kami<i>-sama</i>'s place or anywhere else,

147
00:20:22,325 --> 00:20:24,265
I'm going to come with you.

148
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:34,395
<i>I'm going to have Kami-sama</i>
<i>train me through-and-through!</i>

149
00:20:34,435 --> 00:20:37,105
<i>Son, let's make sure we meet again!</i>

150
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:54,525
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, I'm Son Goku...

151
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:00,425
<i>Oni</i>!

152
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:08,505
Yow! Kaio<i>-sama</i>, you're
training is as tough as I expected...

153
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:20,945
Ee-yow!

154
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:30,325
W-Where is this place?

155
00:21:31,895 --> 00:21:36,165
I wonder if I've arrived at Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s
place without even realizing it.

156
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:40,835
That smells good!

157
00:21:57,925 --> 00:22:00,255
That fruit looks delicious!

158
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:14,265
<i>Just where exactly has Goku fallen into?</i>

159
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:19,565
<i>And as Umigame was anxious about,</i>

160
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:23,005
<i>and the Turtle Hermit was</i>
<i>unable to offer a reply to,</i>

161
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:29,545
<i>will Goku and the others be able</i>
<i>to defend Earth against the Saiyans?</i>

162
00:22:44,505 --> 00:22:48,495
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

163
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:54,375
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

164
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,745
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

165
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:05,245
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

166
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:11,725
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

167
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,825
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

168
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:19,325
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

169
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,995
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

170
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:29,505
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

171
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:33,575
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

172
00:23:33,615 --> 00:23:35,415
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

173
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:39,485
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

174
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:45,155
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

175
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:47,325
<i>So sorry.</i>

176
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:52,425
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

177
00:23:55,135 --> 00:24:00,405
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

178
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:13,715
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

179
00:24:13,755 --> 00:24:17,625
<i>Wow, I've had it! I just took a</i>
<i>little nap, and fell down into Hell!</i>

180
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,955
<i>Father, what is Hell like?</i>

181
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:24,295
<i>Hmm, let's see... There's</i>
<i>a blue ogre, and a red ogre,</i>

182
00:24:24,335 --> 00:24:26,165
<i>and we play tag every day.</i>

183
00:24:26,205 --> 00:24:28,195
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

184
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:31,165
<i>"Hands Off! Yama-sama's Secret Fruit."</i>

185
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,135
<i>Wow, that sounds like fun.</i>

186
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:36,175
<i>Father, it's no fair that</i>
<i>you're the only one who gets to.</i>

187
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:38,045
"Next time"
"Hands Off! Yama<i>-sama</i>'s Secret Fruit"
