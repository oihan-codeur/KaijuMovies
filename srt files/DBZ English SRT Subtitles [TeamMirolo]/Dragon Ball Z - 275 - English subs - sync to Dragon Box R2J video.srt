<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,745

<i>Having infiltrated their</i>
<i>way inside Majin Boo's body,</i>

24
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:05,065
<i>Goku and Vegeta returned</i>
<i>to their original forms,</i>

25
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:08,365
<i>and began searching</i>
<i>for Gohan and the others.</i>

26
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:59,625
Fighting against these
two opponents is truly hard!

27
00:02:59,665 --> 00:03:02,625
And at a critical time like this,
Kakarrot is not around!

28
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:20,015
<i>Even as they were baffled</i>

29

<i>by the sudden appearance of</i>
<i>false versions of Gohan and company,</i>

00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:25,395
<i>they finally found the real ones!</i>

31
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:28,405
Hey, Kakarrot!

32
00:03:28,445 --> 00:03:30,945
This way! They're here!

33
00:03:38,035 --> 00:03:43,545
<i>"A Majin's Secret!!</i>
<i>Two More Boos Inside Of Boo."</i>

34
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:57,225
The pipsqueaks' union has been separated,

35
00:03:57,265 --> 00:04:00,975
like ours was, so there's two of them.

36
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:06,525
No, they separated because their
Fusion had lasted for thirty minutes.

37
00:04:09,605 --> 00:04:15,575
When Gotenks was absorbed, Boo
certainly displayed the traits of Fusion.

38
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:20,865
Which means performing
Fusion is okay, even in here.

39
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,485
Just how many times does he have to
go around this city before he's satisfied?

40
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,445
This makes the 25th cake store he's been to.

41
00:05:07,045 --> 00:05:10,665
Now then, my belly is full...

42
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:19,555
Now where does he plan on going?

43
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:25,565
W-What are you doing?
We're going to lose sight of him!

44
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:28,435
Please, allow me to rest for a little bit.

45
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:43,455
You can't trust anyone
that can fly through the air!

46
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:58,595
In recognition of my becoming
invincible, I'll eradicate this planet!

47
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,895
What in the world is going on inside here?

48
00:06:10,435 --> 00:06:12,395
You're in the way. Move!

49
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:14,485
We're going to tear them out from there!

50
00:06:39,045 --> 00:06:40,885
<i>W-What's this?!</i>

51
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,635
Come on...!

52
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:49,185
W-What?

53
00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:56,905
What the hell does this mean? I-It can't be...!

54
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:00,985
Yahoo! Boo is returning
to the way he was! All right!

55
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:04,785
Way to go! Way to go! Way to go! Way to go!

56
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,705
Way to–!

57
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:13,215
He's gone back! He's gone back!
They did it! They did it!

58
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,415
Way to go! Way to go!

59
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:23,015
Boo's power must have
dropped considerably after that.

60
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:24,515
Just a little bit farther now.

61
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:31,775
There, see? The size of his <i>ki</i> is
completely different than it was before.

62
00:07:31,815 --> 00:07:35,775
All right. Now we blow
this place away and get out.

63
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:37,485
Yeah.

64
00:07:40,815 --> 00:07:46,575
B-But hold on a second. No matter how
much Boo may have returned to normal,

65
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:50,495
even at that, he still has more
strength than we can stand up to.

66
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:56,545
If we go outside like this,
we'll be beaten for sure!

67
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:59,795
In that case, what else
would you have us do? Huh?

68
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:03,055
This is because you're the
one who broke your Potara!

69
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:07,885
In that case, you can live
out your life inside Boo's head.

70
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:09,725
I'm not about to.

71
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:20,615
Even so, there's still one
method by which we can win!

72
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:21,775
No way.

73
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:24,785
I still ain't said a thing!

74
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:29,785
You want to suggest Fusion, right?
I know about it–what it is.

75
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,625
You already know?

76
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:35,625
I saw it from the Other World.
You've got to be joking!

77
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:38,625
How could I go through
an inelegant pose like that?!

78
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:43,635
I-Is it all that inelegant?
I don't think it's so bad...

79
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:47,635
And besides, I told you already that
I'm not about to merge with you again!

80
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:56,725
Hey! What does this mean?!

81
00:09:07,445 --> 00:09:09,575
Majin Boo...

82
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:12,495
It's the one from the very beginning.

83
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,005
Inside of Boo, there's yet another Boo, huh?

84
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:25,845
Does this mean he was
absorbed too? By himself?

85
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:39,395
Huh?

86
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:44,405
Huh? Huh? What's this? Suddenly,
the inside of Boo isn't being displayed!

87
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:48,155
Th-That can't be! It was just
getting to something important!

88
00:09:54,535 --> 00:09:57,915
Hey, should we try tearing him out too?

89
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,835
That skinny Majin Boo
was born of this Majin Boo,

90
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,925
then he turned this fat
one into choco and ate him.

91
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,295
I'll turn you into choco!

92
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:28,215
Then maybe everyone else who
was turned into choco and eaten

93
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:30,345
could be around somewhere, huh?

94
00:11:30,385 --> 00:11:33,515
They aren't! He's the only
one to get special treatment.

95
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:38,895
Here I thought things were strange,
and sure enough, it's your doing...

96
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:40,315
What's going on?!

97
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:43,485
W-Why is Majin Boo showing up inside himself?!

98
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:47,905
I don't know how this happened,
but it seems you weren't absorbed!

99
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:51,825
How dare you remove the others
I took so much trouble to absorb?!

100
00:11:56,535 --> 00:11:58,915
Damn, th-this could be bad!

101
00:11:58,955 --> 00:12:01,745
This is why I told you to
keep the Potara on, you know!

102
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:05,415
Once we're outside, if we could only
merge, this guy would be easy to beat!

103
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:13,595
Is that so? You guys
cannot merge any more, then?

104
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:16,595
You idiot! If you'd kept quiet,
he wouldn't have known that!

105
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,685
You don't say. You don't say, then!

106
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:00,725
All right, if you're coming, then come on!

107
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:04,605
I'll open up a giant
hole here inside your body!

108
00:13:06,225 --> 00:13:10,605
What are you laughing about?
You don't think I can open one?

109
00:13:10,645 --> 00:13:12,485
It's impossible!

110
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:17,115
Don't you belittle me.

111
00:13:51,145 --> 00:13:53,525
Th-That's ridiculous!

112
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:56,115
Th-There's no effect?

113
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:59,785
All I felt was a little twinge in this area here.

114
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:08,795
Have you forgotten? Right now,
you're much, much smaller than even fleas!

115
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:17,295
In other words, after we defeat you,
we'll have to find ourselves an exit?

116
00:14:20,265 --> 00:14:23,805
That will be impossible as well,
for you two as you are now.

117
00:14:23,845 --> 00:14:25,805
Shall we put it to the test?

118
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,515
Of course we will!

119
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:58,555
We've completely lost sight of Majin Boo!

120
00:14:58,595 --> 00:15:04,515
No, we've gotten quite close to him.
I'm sure he should be around here.

121
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:10,605
H-How can you tell that?

122
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:15,605
From his <i>ki</i>. I can feel Majin Boo's <i>ki</i> nearby.

123
00:15:15,645 --> 00:15:19,315
W-What? What was that? Majin Boo's "<i>ki</i>"...?
[<i>ki</i>: tree]

124
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,705
Tree!!

125
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:31,495
He's here!

126
00:15:46,265 --> 00:15:48,935
S-See? On top of that rock!

127
00:15:54,565 --> 00:15:57,695
What's the matter? He's not moving.

128
00:15:57,735 --> 00:16:02,405
H-His form has gone back to how
it was before! W-What in the world?

129
00:16:07,655 --> 00:16:10,785
W-What exactly could be going on?

130
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:12,835
I don't know either! I'm getting annoyed!

131
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,585
Annoyed, annoyed, annoyed, annoyed!

132
00:16:23,845 --> 00:16:25,215
Don't you look down on us!

133
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:35,275
What?!

134
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,535
Y-You rock-head...!

135
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:55,545
That was a moronic attack, but
it looks like it had quite an effect.

136
00:16:55,585 --> 00:16:57,705
No way it could have!

137
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,645
Let's go, Vegeta!

138
00:17:11,685 --> 00:17:13,645
Don't you give me orders!

139
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:37,705
How long are you going to stick on me?!
Hurry up and get away from me!

140
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,795
Take care of the fragments from Majin Boo!

141
00:17:39,835 --> 00:17:41,505
R-Right!

142
00:17:55,765 --> 00:18:01,185
<i>That bastard... If I'd known this,</i>
<i>I'd have rather merged with him!</i>

143
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:05,775
Yo, Vegeta! Are you done there, too?

144
00:18:05,815 --> 00:18:07,655
Stay back, Kakarrot!

145
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:11,825
What?!

146
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:17,795
Have you forgotten what place this is?

147
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:19,545
Where are you, Boo?!

148
00:18:38,265 --> 00:18:39,645
Bastard!

149
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:43,605
This is the inside of my body!

150
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:46,565
Inside here, I am immortal!

151
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:07,215
Don't you understand?!

152
00:19:08,675 --> 00:19:11,175
Why, you...!

153
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:19,105
Blow me to pieces, and I still
won't die! The reason being, I am Boo!

154
00:19:26,645 --> 00:19:28,485
S-Shut up!

155
00:19:54,175 --> 00:19:59,265
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!!

156
00:20:09,155 --> 00:20:12,275
Shut up!!

157
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:22,665
Vegeta, take it easy!
Don't fall for Boo's taunting!

158
00:20:34,595 --> 00:20:38,805
Huh? Are you trying to kill your
friends who you worked so hard to rescue?

159
00:20:45,605 --> 00:20:48,565
<i>That was dirty, Boo!</i>

160
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:19,555
Where's Boo?

161
00:21:24,185 --> 00:21:27,355
Like I told you!
It's impossible for you to beat me!

162
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:29,935
I'm getting tired of this. I'm done playing!

163
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:06,645
<i>This is a desperate pinch!</i>

164
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:09,645
<i>Even though they have managed</i>
<i>to rescue Gohan and the others,</i>

165
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:14,105
<i>can it be impossible for them to</i>
<i>escape from before the immortal Boo?</i>

166
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:25,875
Vegeta!!

167
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:39,055
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

168
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:45,595
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

169
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:56,195
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

170
00:22:56,235 --> 00:23:02,285
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

171
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:09,295
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

172
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:14,665
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

173
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:18,545
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

174
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:27,605
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

175
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:29,145
<i>Even now?</i>

176
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:36,775
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

177
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:42,195
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

178
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:48,665
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

179
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:58,715
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

180
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:15,945
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

181
00:24:15,985 --> 00:24:20,365
<i>Hey, Vegeta, after you</i>
<i>ripped that chubby Boo out,</i>

182
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:22,365
<i>Boo's body started acting funny.</i>

183
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:24,945
<i>He's probably just going to transform again.</i>

184
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:28,495
<i>But never mind him, we've</i>
<i>got to get out of here first.</i>

185
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:30,625
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

186
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:34,455
<i>"Where Is the Exit!?</i>
<i>Escape from a Collapsing Boo."</i>

187
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:37,665
<i>Boo is changing into a</i>
<i>form we've never seen before.</i>

188
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:39,795
"Next time"
"Where Is the Exit!?
Escape from a Collapsing Boo"
