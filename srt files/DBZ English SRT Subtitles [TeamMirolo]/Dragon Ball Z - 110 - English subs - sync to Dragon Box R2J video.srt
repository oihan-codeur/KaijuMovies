What have we here? If it isn't Piccolo<i>-san.</i>

21
00:03:26,075 --> 00:03:28,705
Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i> is waiting for you.

22
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:31,375
He has much he wishes to say to you.

23
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:34,075
Garlic Jr., you say?

24
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:54,355
<i>"The Heavenly Realm is the Battlefield!!</i>
<i>Piccolo Becomes Devilish Again..."</i>

Garlic Jr., huh?

26
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:10,015
There was once someone so foolish...

27
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:13,385
...he fell into a Dead Zone of his
own making and couldn't get out.

28
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:14,885
Wasn't that his name?

29
00:04:14,925 --> 00:04:16,915
What?!

30
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:19,255
Garlic Jr....

31
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,195
What's happening?

32
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:28,895
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, do you hang
around with monsters like this?

33
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:34,705
–I'm shocked! I'm shocked! I'm shocked!
–M-M-Maron<i>-chan</i>!

34
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:39,375
How did he escape from the Dead Zone?

35
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:43,615
I doubt you guys had
the power to do it alone.

36
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:46,145
That's enough out of you!

37
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,985
I'll tell you how.

38
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,625
It's thanks to the Makyo World.

39
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,765
The Makyo World?

40
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,195
That's right.

41
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:12,405
The homeworld of our Demon Clan.
It approaches Earth every 5000 years.

42
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:18,215
You once numbered
yourself among the Demons,

43
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:19,915
you must have known this.

44
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:26,055
As the Makyo World approaches,
our dormant powers awaken,

45
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:29,255
and we grow several dozen times stronger.

46
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:38,005
Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i> raised his increased
dormant powers as high as they would go,

47
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:42,005
and freed himself under his own power.

48
00:05:53,355 --> 00:05:57,085
And now that he's defeated
Kami in the Heavenly Realm,

49
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:01,525
and gained immortality
with the Dragon Balls,

50
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:04,195
Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i> has
become Kami for all eternity!

51
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:09,125
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>?

52
00:06:09,165 --> 00:06:11,135
All that remains is to wait for the Aquamist...

53
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:15,805
...to change all living things
on Earth into Demon Clansmen.

54
00:06:15,845 --> 00:06:19,645
That will only take a few hours more!

55
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:25,375
The effects of the Aquamist will
become permanent after 24 hours.

56
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:28,385
That means that 24 hours after breathing it,

57
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:33,655
not even the Ultra Holy Water
will return you to normal!

58
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,595
H-How awful!

59
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,055
By sunrise tomorrow,

60
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:43,765
every living thing on Earth will
bow down before Garlic Jr<i>.-sama.</i>

61
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:49,975
Piccolo, our Garlic Jr.
is a magnanimous being.

62
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:54,575
If you would go along, he said he
would be willing to forget about the past.

63
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:58,175
How about it?

64
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:04,415
Don't you want to once again live
as they do, as a Demon Clansman?

65
00:07:07,265 --> 00:07:08,555
Don't you want to join us...

66
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:13,395
...in seeing that the world is again
filled with terror and hopelessness?

67
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:17,765
This is the desire of Garlic Jr<i>.-sama.</i>

68
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:34,915
Why you!

69
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,455
Is that your answer?

70
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:41,295
In that case, we'll have
to persuade you by force!

71
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,495
Go ahead and try.

72
00:07:55,845 --> 00:07:58,645
What's the matter, Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

73
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,055
Stop this, Yamucha<i>-san</i>!

74
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,295
Move it!

75
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:21,995
Piccolo<i>-san</i>! Stop it!

76
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,735
What are you doing, Kurin<i>-chan</i>?

77
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,735
Your opponent is an old man, isn't he?

78
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:32,405
Why don't you clock him one?
Clock him one good!

79
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,435
H-How can you ask me to do that?

80
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:43,525
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

81
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,155
Maron<i>-chan</i>!

82
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:03,035
Everyone is ganging up on me!

83
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,905
Maron<i>-chan</i>!

84
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:11,375
Help me!

85
00:09:11,415 --> 00:09:13,385
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

86
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:21,755
Maron<i>-chan</i>!

87
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:26,895
Haiya Dragon!

88
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:29,265
Take care of Maron<i>-chan</i>!

89
00:09:30,775 --> 00:09:32,365
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

90
00:09:33,245 --> 00:09:37,405
Watching these friends kill each
other is really something to see.

91
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,305
Please stop!

92
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:41,335
Look out!

93
00:09:47,455 --> 00:09:48,855
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

94
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:52,985
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, are you all right?

95
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:55,125
I can handle this by myself!

96
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:58,155
You guys go to the Heavenly Realm!

97
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:00,895
Get the Ultra Holy Water away from Garlic!

98
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:02,925
B-But...

99
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:06,065
Gohan, let's leave this to Piccolo!

100
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,765
There's no time to spare!

101
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:11,265
If we don't hurry, they're
going to have their way!

102
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:18,045
Go!

103
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:20,955
Right! Okay, then!

104
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:48,445
This is unfortunate for all of
you, but I need for you to die.

105
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:11,105
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

106
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:46,365
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

107
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,065
Stay away!

108
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:09,595
Hurry! Hurry up!

109
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:11,985
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

110
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:17,095
I said go!

111
00:12:23,415 --> 00:12:25,475
The kid, he's getting away!

112
00:12:25,515 --> 00:12:26,975
Let him go.

113
00:12:27,015 --> 00:12:29,545
He's headed to the Temple
of the Heavenly Realm anyway.

114
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:31,415
It saves us the bother.

115
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:38,425
I-I'm counting on you, Gohan!

116
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,275
Go-Gohan...

117
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:06,745
Gohan!

118
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:07,885
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

119
00:13:07,925 --> 00:13:09,745
Well, let's go!

120
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:11,085
Right!

121
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,425
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

122
00:13:20,965 --> 00:13:24,735
Kurin<i>-chan</i>! Just a minute!

123
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:30,405
No way, Maron<i>-chan</i>, you and Haiya
Dragon have to find somewhere safe to hide!

124
00:13:30,445 --> 00:13:33,435
You have to be kidding! I'm going with you!

125
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:38,745
It sounds like fun. And I love adventures!

126
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:43,415
Maron<i>-chan.</i> Where we're going
isn't going to be all that easygoing.

127
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:44,885
It's all right.

128
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:49,055
If it gets really dangerous,
you're going to save me, Kurin<i>-chan.</i>

129
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,055
Unbelievable!

130
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,055
I get it now.

131
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:57,735
Go ahead and toss me aside, and
take off to wherever you feel like going!

132
00:13:57,775 --> 00:13:59,765
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, we have to hurry!

133
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,105
Uh, yeah...

134
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:10,115
Oh, all right.

135
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:17,285
Haiya Dragon, fly as fast as you can!

136
00:14:19,455 --> 00:14:22,125
This is why I like you so much, Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

137
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:43,855
This guy sure has a big mouth!

138
00:14:44,755 --> 00:14:45,655
Don't.

139
00:14:46,415 --> 00:14:48,715
If we kill him, then Kami dies,

140
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,385
and we won't be able to use the Dragon Balls.

141
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,385
Oh, that's right.

142
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:55,485
Besides...

143
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:02,465
Being bitten by one of these guys...

144
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:05,375
...puts you in the same condition
as if you had inhaled the Aquamist.

145
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:21,175
Rise then, our newfound ally.

146
00:15:56,585 --> 00:16:03,425
D-Damn. Even with all of us
Litts against just one monkey...

147
00:16:03,465 --> 00:16:06,435
For us to be wiped out...

148
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:23,405
Hey, I have something to ask you.

149
00:16:23,445 --> 00:16:24,415
There should have been...

150
00:16:24,455 --> 00:16:28,415
...a Saiyan calling himself Kakarrot
or Son Goku on this planet recently.

151
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,085
S-Saiyan, you say?

152
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:32,455
That's right. Where did he go?

153
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:36,385
You mean there are
more of them than just you?

154
00:16:36,425 --> 00:16:40,395
Filthy Saiyan monkeys!

155
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:43,095
So then, you don't know?

156
00:16:47,045 --> 00:16:50,235
If you see Freeza in the
Other World, tell him this for me–

157
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:54,905
"I'm going to beat the same
Kakarrot that killed you."

158
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:57,075
"You should feel grateful."

159
00:16:57,115 --> 00:17:02,445
Freeza<i>-sama</i> killed by a
Saiyan?! That's impossible!

160
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:05,015
Naive, to the very end.

161
00:17:24,415 --> 00:17:28,805
<i>Kakarrot, I know you're</i>
<i>around here somewhere.</i>

162
00:17:28,845 --> 00:17:31,845
<i>I can feel your unique Saiyan ki.</i>

163
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:43,925
Wherever you are, whatever
you're doing, I'll be sure to find you!

164
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:00,675
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, this is strange!

165
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:03,745
Where could Karin<i>-sama</i> have gone?

166
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:06,375
You don't suppose that strange smoke...

167
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:08,215
Hey! What's the matter?!

168
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:17,155
All right, let's go in.
Keep your eyes peeled, Gohan.

169
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,785
Right!

170
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:29,205
Kurin<i>-chan</i>! I'm getting cold!
Is there anything I can wear?

171
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:36,885
Hey, is this the Heavenly Realm then?
Sure is a gloomy place.

172
00:18:38,455 --> 00:18:39,615
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

173
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,255
What noisy folk you are!

174
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:54,495
Oh, it's you guys?

175
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:55,565
Karin<i>-sama</i>!

176
00:18:55,605 --> 00:18:57,635
You're all right then?

177
00:18:57,675 --> 00:19:01,605
Indeed! And I was sleeping so happily, too.

178
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,005
What a cute kitty<i>-chan</i>!

179
00:19:11,485 --> 00:19:12,955
Hey, now!

180
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:17,785
W-Who is the young lady?

181
00:19:17,825 --> 00:19:20,115
M-Maron<i>-chan.</i>

182
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:24,095
What kind of fool comes to a holy
place such as this wearing a swimsuit?!

183
00:19:24,135 --> 00:19:25,755
No, um, you see...

184
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:28,765
She is Kuririn<i>-san</i>'s girlfriend.

185
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:29,925
What did you say?

186
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:35,105
Nice to meet you!

187
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:36,965
Who're you foolin'?!

188
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:40,445
Ain't no way a pachinko-head
like you could get yerself a girl!

189
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:42,945
It's nothing for you to get upset over, is it?

190
00:19:42,985 --> 00:19:47,215
Well, in that case, it's okay.
So then, what can I do for you?

191
00:19:48,225 --> 00:19:51,785
That's right! Karin<i>-sama</i>, right
now the world is in a terrible mess!

192
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:56,695
Hold on. Rather than having you go
spelling it all out, I'll read your mind.

193
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,675
What's this?! Aquamist?! I see.

194
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:16,005
That's why you're headed
to the Heavenly Plane?

195
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:17,035
R-Right!

196
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:19,375
That will be perilous!

197
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:23,045
The Ultra Holy Water is
surely up in the Heavenly Realm.

198
00:20:23,085 --> 00:20:28,725
However, it is in a container deep
within the temple, next to the Aquamist.

199
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:32,895
It's pretty likely that
Garlic Jr. has it well protected.

200
00:20:35,105 --> 00:20:37,065
Karin<i>-sama</i>! Thank you very much!

201
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,395
Take good care of Maron<i>-chan</i>!

202
00:20:39,435 --> 00:20:41,065
Now hold on there!

203
00:20:41,105 --> 00:20:43,905
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, take me with you!

204
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:49,435
How do you expect me to
look after this loud young lady?!

205
00:20:53,415 --> 00:20:55,885
Now cut that out!

206
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:09,425
This is terrible!

207
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:12,095
Where are Kami<i>-sama</i> and Mister Popo?

208
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:22,975
Welcome to my temple!
I've been waiting for the both of you.

209
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,285
The Ultra Holy Water is in here.

210
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,725
Come and take it!

211
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:35,725
Gohan!

212
00:21:35,765 --> 00:21:36,755
Right!

213
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,075
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

214
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:56,745
Wait! There's something strange about him!

215
00:21:56,785 --> 00:21:58,945
Piccolo, don't tell me, you...

216
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:06,115
We meet again, kid.

217
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:09,455
You're faster than we thought,
I'll give you credit for that.

218
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:11,125
Damn.

219
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,425
They got Piccolo<i>-san</i> too.

220
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,665
<i>W-What's this?!</i>

221
00:22:15,705 --> 00:22:20,395
<i>Piccolo has joined forces with Garlic Jr.?!</i>

222
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:25,605
<i>How will Gohan and Kuririn</i>
<i>overcome this development?</i>

223
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:48,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

224
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

225
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

226
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

227
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

228
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,985
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

229
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:19,495
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

230
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

231
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

232
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

233
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

234
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

235
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

236
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

237
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

238
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,565
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

239
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:13,845
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

240
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:17,485
<i>If even Piccolo has turned demonic,</i>
<i>who's gonna protect Gohan?</i>

241
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:19,685
<i>What exactly is going on, Kurin-chan?</i>

242
00:24:19,725 --> 00:24:23,425
<i>All your friends are turning</i>
<i>demonic, one after the next.</i>

243
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:26,595
<i>Are you really sure they're such prizewinners?</i>

244
00:24:26,635 --> 00:24:28,465
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

245
00:24:28,505 --> 00:24:32,335
<i>"Direct Confrontation with Piccolo!!</i>
<i>An Angry Masenko in the Heavenly Realm."</i>

246
00:24:32,375 --> 00:24:35,675
<i>Father! Come back soon!</i>

247
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:38,305
"Next time"
"Direct Confrontation with Piccolo!!
