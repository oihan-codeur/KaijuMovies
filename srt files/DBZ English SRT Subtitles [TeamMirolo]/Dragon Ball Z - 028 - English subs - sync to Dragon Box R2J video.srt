00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,850

00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,840
Get out of here... Gohan...

00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,550
Piccolo<i>-san</i>! W-Why did you... save me?

26
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:28,720
I-I told you to get out
of here... Hurry, or else...

27
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,760
D-Don't die! Father will be
here soon to beat him for us!

28
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,030
Please, don't die!

29
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:44,340
Miserable fool! My killing order might
have gotten switched around, but oh well.

30
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,610
Either way, it will all turn out the same.

31
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,350
<i>One ki is rapidly growing smaller.</i>

32
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,480

K-Kami<i>-sama...</i>

34
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:29,920
I-It looks like my life is about at
its end... G-Goku didn't make it in time...

35
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:37,860
H-However, at the very end, Piccolo
surpassed even me, Kami... I'm so pleased...

36
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,000
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

37
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,170
W-What a pitiful tale...

38
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:53,570
Imagine, Piccolo Daimao,
of all people, protecting some kid...

39
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,380
Nothing could be worse...

40
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,540
U-Uncle!

41
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,750
Gohan... you're the only one
who ever spoke decent to me...

42
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,860
T-This last year that
I spent with you wasn't bad...

43
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,030
Uncle!

44
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,200
Don't you die, G-Goha–

45
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,670
Uncle!

46
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:03,240
Mister Popo, I leave the rest to you...

47
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,850
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

48
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,890
G-Gohan...

49
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,430
Interesting! You want to fight?

50
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,410
<i>Masenko!</i>

51
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,040
T-That's an incredible <i>ki</i>!

52
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,910
700... 1,200...

53
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,440
2,400...

54
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,250
Battle power 2,800?!

55
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,020
Sure enough, these guys can
alter their battle powers intensely!

56
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,050
2,800, huh?

57
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,440
Gohan!

58
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,250
For a kid, you can do
some amazing things, huh?

59
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,950
My arm tingles a little.

60
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,990
His battle power just plummeted.

61
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,660
It looks like he used up
all of his power just now.

62
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,830
T-They're too strong...
T-They're just too strong...

63
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,300
–Let go of me!
–See here, Chichi Calm down!

64
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,900
–Let me go, I say!
–Come now, Chichi<i>-san...</i>

65
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,040
–Let me go!

66
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:42,910
–H-Hold on, now, that's dangerous...
–Come on, calm down, okay? It's not safe.

67
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,550
T-That's dangerous like that! Stop that!

68
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,790
Aren't you spirited?

69
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,190
–Uranai Baba!
–Sis!

70
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,390
Goku just passed by Karin Tower.

71
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,390
But will he be in time?

72
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,930
I know! Even without a TV,

73
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,270
we can always watch what's
happening using Baba's crystal ball!

74
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,680
Don't be ridiculous! You want to
use my sacred crystal ball to do that?!

75
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,050
–What are you doing?!
–Never mind, just come on inside!

76
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,430
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to avenge you.

77
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,760
Gohan! Run! Get out of there!

78
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,680
Pipsqueak, I'm sending you
to the Next World for sure this time.

79
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,770
I don't have the strength to run away anymore.

80
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,850
D-Damn it all!

81
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,820
I can't wait to see the
look on Kakarrot's face...

82
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,920
...when he sees his own son smashed to a pulp!

83
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,660
Kinto Un?

84
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,250
What is that?

85
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,270
Father!

86
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,180
G-Goku!

87
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,320
So you've finally shown up, huh?

88
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,140
G-Goku! We've been waiting for you!

89
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,910
Father!

90
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,450
What have you come all this way for, Kakarrot?

91
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,790
Don't tell me you're here
to tell us some nonsensical joke,

92
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:17,520
such as you've come
to defeat us, or something.

93
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,410
Piccolo...

94
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,750
Piccolo<i>-san</i> died to protect me.

95
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,090
<i>Tenshinhan...</i>

96
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,860
Yamucha...

97
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,270
Shocked over your dead idiot friends, are you?

98
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:07,250
Come to think of it, there was another,
puny little guy, that went to pieces.

99
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,420
He had more power than
you'd expect for such a runt.

100
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,030
Naturally, he was no match for Nappa<i>-sama.</i>

101
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:34,500
<i>Is that so? Even Chaozu?</i>
<i>And Kami-sama, too... Damn...</i>

102
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,110
There's no need to grieve for them.
You'll be joining your friends soon.

103
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,610
After going through all the
trouble to come back to life,

104
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,090
you just had to stroll on by, huh?

105
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,660
His battle power is rising higher and higher.

106
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,470
W-What? You want to die already?

107
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,270
Here's something by way of greeting!

108
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,040
<i>He's fast!</i>

109
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,550
Gohan, over here.

110
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,280
Kuririn...

111
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,690
G-Goku...

112
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,630
Sorry I'm late. Way to hang on, you two.

113
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,830
Each of you eat half of this.

114
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:41,300
I-Isn't that a senzu bean?
K-Karin<i>-sama</i> still has them, huh?

115
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,700
Mm-hmm. This is the last one.

116
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,710
T-Then, you eat it.

117
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,210
That's all right. I ate one before I came.

118
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,450
N-No, you save it in case you need it.

119
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,320
Even if we recover, we
won't be much help to you.

120
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,850
Don't worry needlessly.

121
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,720
If you don't eat it, I'm throwing it away.

122
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,100
Here.

123
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:09,990
Thanks.

124
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,000
Gohan, you too.

125
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:24,710
Kuririn, you've gotten a lot
stronger, huh? I can tell by your <i>ki.</i>

126
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,210
I thought I had, but to no avail.

127
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm no use against them. They're too strong.

128
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,720
I-I just stood by and let everyone else die...

129
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,720
Gohan, I hardly recognized
you, too. You sure trained hard.

130
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,160
Mm-hmm. Piccolo<i>-san</i> trained
me, but I wasn't able to do anything.

131
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:50,600
With Piccolo<i>-san</i> dead, we'll never
be able to use the Dragon Balls again.

132
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,040
No one is coming back to life.

133
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,720
Let's avenge them–the three of us!

134
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,090
With you joining us, Goku, we
might be able to deal with one of them!

135
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,730
Hey, Goku, you trained under
some incredible guy named Kaio, right?

136
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,930
Yeah.

137
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,030
But I'm going to fight them by myself.

138
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,740
You guys stay back and watch, so
you don't get caught in the middle of it.

139
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,740
B-By yourself?!

140
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:29,810
No matter how strong
you are, Goku, that's crazy!

141
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:34,110
Their strength is far
greater than we can even imagine!

142
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,150
H-He's right, Father!

143
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,770
G-Goku...

144
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,500
Father!

145
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,810
Let Goku handle this!

146
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,340
B-But...

147
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,180
I've never seen Goku show that much anger.

148
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,120
W-We've got no place getting in his way.

149
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,380
Remember, you're going to be
paying me a viewing fee for this.

150
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,660
Goku!

151
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,660
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

152
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,260
Where's Gohan?!

153
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,960
Gohan!

154
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,700
G-Gohan is alive! T-Thank goodness...

155
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,870
Chichi! Goku and Gohan
are fightin'! Keep it together!

156
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:13,610
Son<i>-kun</i>, hang in there! Beat those Saiyans!

157
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,150
P-Piccolo!

158
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,020
Even Piccolo has been done in!

159
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:26,320
Which means we can no
longer use the Dragon Balls!

160
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,700
T-Then, nobody is coming back to life?

161
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,210
What's with that look
on your face? I don't like it.

162
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,050
Is this how badly you
want me to effortlessly kill you?

163
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,620
You're going to pay for this!

164
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,740
Father, you're incredible!

165
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:25,920
Battle power 7,000... 8,000... impossible!

166
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,140
What is Kakarrot's battle power?!

167
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,770
Higher than 8,000!

168
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,640
Higher than 8,000?! There has to
be some mistake! It's a malfunction!

169
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,080
Don't worry, I still won't be
using the <i>Kaio-ken</i> technique on you.

170
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,250
<i>Kaio-ken</i>?

171
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,090
Shut up!

172
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,060
There's no way you can
stand up to Nappa<i>-sama</i>!

173
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,470
<i>What?</i>

174
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,240
H-How did he do that just now?

175
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,980
W-When did you get behind me?

176
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,220
Why, you!

177
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,650
For as big as you were
talking, you ain't all that great.

178
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,660
W-What did you say?!

179
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,060
I-I'm not all that great, am I?!

180
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,400
That's right. I could tell
from your attack just now.

181
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:52,970
Why don't you tell me...

182
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,450
...exactly what it is that you can tell?!

183
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,070
Strange... His battle power is completely
different from when he fought Raditz.

184
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,710
Over here!

185
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,210
D-Did you see your father's moves?

186
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,750
But he's amazing.

187
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,760
<i>What's going on?</i>

188
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,260
<i>How did Kakarrot get this much</i>
<i>power in such a short amount of time?</i>

189
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,910
Why, you!

190
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,820
That punch just now was for Chaozu.

191
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,990
<i>Goku is strong!</i>

192
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,030
<i>But will Goku be able to protect the</i>
<i>Earth from the hands of the Saiyans?</i>

193
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,820
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

194
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,690
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

195
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,060
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

196
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,570
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

197
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,040
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

198
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,110
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

199
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,650
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

200
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,280
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

201
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,800
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

202
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,900
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

203
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

204
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:37,770
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

205
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:43,440
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

206
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,610
<i>So sorry.</i>

207
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,750
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

208
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,730
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

209
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,870
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

210
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,740
<i>Woah, awesome! I ain't ever</i>
<i>seen anyone as awesome as this guy!</i>

211
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:23,180
<i>Brace yourself! Your life will only</i>
<i>last for a moment against Vegeta!</i>

212
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,450
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

213
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,050
<i>"Father is Awesome! Kaio-ken,</i>
<i>the Ultimate Finishing Technique."</i>

214
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,000
<i>Father, avenge Piccolo-san!</i>

215
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,430
"Next time"
"Father is Awesome! <i>Kaio-ken,</i>
the Ultimate Finishing Technique"
