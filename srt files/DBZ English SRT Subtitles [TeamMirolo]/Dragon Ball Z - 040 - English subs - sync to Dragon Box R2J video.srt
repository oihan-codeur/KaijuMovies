We come from a planet called Earth,
and in no way do we mean you any–

24
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:15,215
I don't want to hear anything
you invaders have to say to us!

Invaders? W-W-Wait just a minute, would you?

26
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:22,825
There's nothing sinister about
us, I tell you! We're not invaders!

00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,265
Shut up!

28
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,825
Hold on a minute! Those boys are right!

29
00:04:28,865 --> 00:04:35,365
You talk too much for men!
You're not popular with the girls, so–

30
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:38,605
Stop standing around and do something!

31
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,215
Gohan, we're fighting.

32
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:45,615
Right.

33
00:05:11,575 --> 00:05:15,745
Yee-ow-ow-ow!

34
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:17,315
Hey! What did you do that for?!

35
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:18,515
Don't move!

36
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:23,715
I-I really will kill you.

37
00:05:27,525 --> 00:05:31,725
Zeshin, let's hurry and kill them.
These guys have to be Freeza's men.

38
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,325
Y-Yeah...

39
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:43,345
W-We have to kill them, huh?

40
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,845
W-What's happening?!

41
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:59,255
Zeshin! Bad news!
We've gone into a meteor swarm!

42
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:01,485
What?! Damn...

43
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:07,465
Hey, keep an eye on these guys! If they
try anything funny, shoot them right there!

44
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,655
Kuririn!

45
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:38,055
Now's our chance! Save me, quickly!

46
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:39,725
Y-Yeah. Gohan...

47
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:40,925
Right.

48
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:55,505
No! No! No! Absolutely no way!

49
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:06,585
Oww!

50
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:08,755
I haven't even stuck you yet.

51
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:14,795
My, my, Goku is positively
hopeless over this sort of thing.

52
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:18,665
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

53
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:22,405
I told you, I haven't stuck you yet.

54
00:07:22,445 --> 00:07:26,375
Good grief. For someone who's
always doin' push-ups and sit-ups,

55
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,945
what are you so upset over
somethin' as small as this for?

56
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:29,945
Chichi...

57
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:31,715
Hmph! How embarrassin'.

58
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:36,585
Compared to the sufferin' Gohan went
through, that pain should be nothin' at all.

59
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:44,425
I'm goin' to go pace a hundred times in
front of the shrine for Gohan<i>-chan</i>'s sake.

60
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:49,795
Chichi...

61
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,595
And stickum...

62
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,395
What are you doing?! Hurry it up!

63
00:08:19,435 --> 00:08:21,725
Right... but...

64
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:26,135
Any ship that goes into a meteor swarm like
this won't last long, no matter how tough it is!

65
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:28,905
If we don't hurry, we won't be spared, either!

66
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:33,405
But that's why we can't just
leave these needy people like this...

67
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,215
Who are you calling needy people?!

68
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,135
Are you okay?

69
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:05,845
All right!

70
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:20,325
W-Who are these guys?

71
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:25,695
Somebody help!

72
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,295
Oh, no!

73
00:09:27,335 --> 00:09:29,095
Take care of things here!

74
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:37,265
Geez, you two are just too nice to others...

75
00:09:40,285 --> 00:09:43,915
Hey! What kind of piloting is that?!

76
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,225
Which one is–? Damn!

77
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:03,595
I can't stand to watch this! Move it!

78
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:05,595
What are you doing?!

79
00:10:05,635 --> 00:10:08,765
Let me do this. I'm a pro
at this sort of thing, after all.

80
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,775
How can we trust you?!

81
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,905
W-We don't need your help!

82
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:17,345
Letting me do this is better
than getting everyone killed, right?

83
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:22,045
Let's see... this and this controls
the ascent, and this is left and right.

84
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:24,285
Which one is the speed control?

85
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:30,595
Hurry up and tell me!
You don't want to die, do you?!

86
00:10:30,635 --> 00:10:33,195
T-The keys on the left side.

87
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:34,725
Okay.

88
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:12,195
Awesome!

89
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:35,025
Looks like we somehow
managed to pull through, huh?

90
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:43,265
W-What is this? Don't you trust us yet?

91
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:45,635
How can we ever trust you?!

92
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:49,905
Your pals are the ones who
destroyed our planet, after all!

93
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:11,755
What do you mean, our pals?

94
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:13,765
Hmph, don't play dumb!

95
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:16,895
You guys are Freeza's men, aren't you?

96
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:18,495
Freeza?

97
00:12:18,535 --> 00:12:20,305
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

98
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,875
Help me out here, Kuririn.

99
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:26,875
These kids still seem to have us all wrong.

100
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:28,875
We don't have anything wrong!

101
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:33,885
We were convinced when we
saw that barbaric power you have!

102
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,685
Barbaric, he says?

103
00:12:35,725 --> 00:12:37,685
That's mean.

104
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:40,885
I will admit that those two are barbarians,

105
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:44,055
but I am a sincere person,
who loves peace and justice.

106
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,095
N-Now hold on...

107
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,695
How can we believe what you're saying?!

108
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,595
Hold it!

109
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,035
Z-Zeshin...

110
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:54,205
Guys, it's okay for you to put your guns down.

111
00:12:54,245 --> 00:12:57,875
Why, Zeshin?! These guys are Freeza's men!

112
00:12:57,915 --> 00:13:01,205
Their pals are the ones
who killed our moms and dads!

113
00:13:01,245 --> 00:13:04,775
If they were Freeza's men,
they wouldn't have saved us.

114
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,985
They would have just suddenly
come attacking us, and have killed us all.

115
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:11,215
That's right. Before, they came without warning,

116
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:15,425
and killed Dad and Mom
without saying anything, didn't they?!

117
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,425
Maybe so, but...

118
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:32,315
<i>Dad! Mom!</i>

119
00:14:06,985 --> 00:14:09,545
You've got a nice look in your eyes.

120
00:14:11,855 --> 00:14:13,685
Bun...

121
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:19,615
Thanks for believing us.

122
00:14:19,655 --> 00:14:23,695
Then again, those guys
sound just like Saiyans, huh?

123
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:29,465
Say, by any chance, did the
guys that attacked you have tails?

124
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,465
Tails? No, they didn't have those.

125
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:35,465
I-I see. Then they weren't Saiyans, huh?

126
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:39,635
Which would mean that there
are other bad folks out here in space.

127
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:43,705
So, what happened to your planet?

128
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:50,555
Our planet was peaceful,
and a very easy place to live.

129
00:14:50,595 --> 00:14:53,285
Until <i>they</i> came!

130
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:14,545
Those guys appeared
before us without any warning.

131
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:17,545
They said they were going to
deliver our world to Freeza<i>-sama,</i>

132
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:19,945
and that we should be thankful.

133
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:27,385
And then they suddenly started killing
our dads and moms like they were worms.

134
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,955
They were going to kill all the
people who were on the planet,

135
00:15:30,995 --> 00:15:33,595
and turn it over to Freeza!

136
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,405
I'm surprised you guys survived.

137
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:47,575
The adults, who realized what Freeza's
scheme was, had us escape in spaceships.

138
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:52,875
But all of the other spaceships were
chased down by Freeza and shot down!

139
00:15:52,915 --> 00:15:56,445
So this mirror-clad spaceship
is the only one that survived.

140
00:15:56,485 --> 00:16:03,895
Mirror-clad spaceship? I see,
so the mirrors reflect outer space.

141
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:07,925
That explains why we couldn't
see the shape of your ship, either.

142
00:16:14,945 --> 00:16:18,905
So where are you guys going now?
Do you have any destination?

143
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:23,915
Yeah, there's a planet where our dads
used to travel to on business long ago.

144
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,915
We're sure that they will take us in.

145
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:28,485
Is this planet far away?

146
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:32,725
Not to worry. We'll get to that planet,
no matter how many years it takes.

147
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:46,865
Hang in there, all right?

148
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,005
Yeah. You guys, too.

149
00:16:49,045 --> 00:16:50,345
Right.

150
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:57,815
Okay, let's go. We've lost quite
a bit of time, so we need to hurry.

151
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,645
Oh, that's okay, isn't it?
Planet Namek isn't going anywhere.

152
00:17:02,685 --> 00:17:06,655
Planet Namek? Are you
guys going to Planet Namek?

153
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:08,785
That's right. You know it?

154
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:12,655
We passed it about two weeks ago.

155
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:18,195
If you go straight in the direction
KS-162, there should be quite a shortcut.

156
00:17:18,235 --> 00:17:20,195
Huh? You mean it?

157
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:22,205
Y-Yeah...

158
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:27,605
The direction KS-162, right?
Thank you! Come on, we're going.

159
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:29,205
Bye-bye.

160
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:33,245
Oh, but that shortcut is...

161
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,525
Well, they're gone.

162
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:47,225
They were nice folks, huh?

163
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,855
Bun...

164
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,545
Okay, we'll hurry on, too!

165
00:18:00,585 --> 00:18:03,575
All right! Guys, let's go!

166
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:13,115
Take direction KS-162
and head to Planet Namek.

167
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:16,125
That's a bit of a relief, huh?

168
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:17,125
What's the matter?

169
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:21,565
Oh, I'm just worried about the
other bad aliens those kids talked about.

170
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:24,035
But they weren't the Saiyans, right?

171
00:18:24,075 --> 00:18:27,565
However, the Saiyans did have allies.

172
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:30,735
They've got nothing to do with us.

173
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:35,345
Well, I'm going to bed.
I'm completely exhausted.

174
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:40,945
<i>However, Kuririn's concerns</i>
<i>were by no means off the mark.</i>

175
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,525
<i>Eighteen days after Vegeta left Earth...</i>

176
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,165
All right, here...

177
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:58,065
Something is coming!

178
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:01,765
–Is it Freeza<i>-sama</i>?
–It couldn't be! He just left!

179
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:04,735
I-It's an older model. It's a soldier.

180
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:07,775
That signal is Vegeta<i>-sama</i>'s.

181
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:10,675
That's strange. We didn't get
any word that he was returning.

182
00:19:10,715 --> 00:19:12,075
Could something have happened to him?

183
00:19:12,115 --> 00:19:15,645
Hey, this is the control room!
Vegeta<i>-sama</i> is arriving!

184
00:19:15,685 --> 00:19:17,685
Fall out to greet him at once!

185
00:19:22,825 --> 00:19:24,025
He's here.

186
00:19:24,065 --> 00:19:27,055
There's just one pod,
all right. Where's Nappa<i>-san</i>?

187
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:43,045
What's the matter? He's not coming out.

188
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:46,045
H-Hey, his life signs are awfully low.

189
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,715
What?

190
00:19:49,425 --> 00:19:51,385
He's using the life-support equipment!

191
00:19:51,425 --> 00:19:54,325
This is bad! Hurry and take
him to the treatment center!

192
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:22,015
W-W-What is that?!

193
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:23,755
An earthquake?

194
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:32,855
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>, has something
happened to cause this shaking?!

195
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:36,565
You guys make light of outer space, so that's
why you're so surprised by something like this.

196
00:20:36,605 --> 00:20:40,095
This is a shortcut, so it's
going to be a little bumpy.

197
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:55,445
How can she sleep through a situation like this?

198
00:21:21,985 --> 00:21:24,915
I-It's settled down.

199
00:21:31,495 --> 00:21:33,715
That was mean, Bulma<i>-san.</i>

200
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:36,555
I didn't think that <i>you</i>
would try anything like this!

201
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:39,295
No, you misunderstand, Bulma<i>-san</i>!

202
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:44,635
How would you know?! You're a
student of that Old Man Turtle, too, after all!

203
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:51,505
Poor Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

204
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:53,445
Look at that!

205
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:59,785
We made it! We've arrived at Planet Namek!

206
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,745
That was fast, huh?
It's only been about ten days.

207
00:22:03,785 --> 00:22:06,015
That's what a shortcut will do for you.

208
00:22:06,055 --> 00:22:08,325
Is that really...

209
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:09,825
...Planet Namek?

210
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:14,855
Sure it is. Isn't it obvious?
Just like those kids said.

211
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:27,715
<i>Bulma and the others had arrived in</i>
<i>no time. But was this really Planet Namek?</i>

212
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:48,025
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

213
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:53,895
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

214
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:56,275
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

215
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:04,775
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

216
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:11,255
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

217
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:15,355
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

218
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,855
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

219
00:23:18,895 --> 00:23:21,525
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

220
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:29,035
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

221
00:23:31,245 --> 00:23:33,105
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

222
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,945
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

223
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:39,015
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

224
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:44,685
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

225
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,855
<i>So sorry.</i>

226
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:51,955
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

227
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:59,935
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

228
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:13,545
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

229
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:16,645
<i>What? Gohan and the others</i>
<i>have already arrived on Planet Namek?</i>

230
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:17,755
<i>We made it!</i>

231
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:20,655
<i>Okay, everyone, let's start looking</i>
<i>for the Dragon Balls, right away!</i>

232
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:24,255
<i>Huh? By any chance, are you guys Namekians?</i>

233
00:24:24,295 --> 00:24:25,995
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

234
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:29,595
<i>"Kind-hearted Aliens.</i>
<i>There's the Wu Xing Qiu Ball Already."</i>

235
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:34,105
<i>Father, I made friends with the aliens.</i>

236
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:37,335
"Next time"
"Kind-hearted Aliens
There's the Wu Xing Qiu Ball Already"
