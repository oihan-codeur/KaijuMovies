<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,780
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:56,740
Three years from this time,
on May 12, at around 10 a.m.,

17
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,410
on an island located 9 kilometers
southwest of Metro South,

18
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,780
a terrifying pair will appear.

19
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,750
They will be monsters,
both possessing a power so great,

20
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,780
it will be unthinkable
that they are of this world.

21
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,400
<i>The fearsome enemies that Trunks,</i>

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,070
<i>the youth from the</i>
<i>future had told them about,</i>

23
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,580
<i>as well as his hellish future–it was for</i>
<i>these reasons that Goku, Piccolo, Vegeta,</i>

24
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,050
<i>and the other Z Warriors desperately</i>
<i>continued their special training.</i>

25
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:49,090
<i>The Artificial Humans will appear in three years.</i>

26
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,920
<i>There is no time for the warriors to take off.</i>

27
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,200
<i>Until one day...</i>

28
00:02:54,370 --> 00:03:02,400
<i>"License Mastery?</i>
<i>Goku's Newest Trial."</i>

29
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,810
Cut it out! I ain't all that tasty!

30
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,590
Stop!

31
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,930
That cloud looks like Old Man Turtle Hermit.

32
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:20,250
Father, look!

33
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,250
Oh, you caught us a
huge one there, Gohan.

34
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,120
Chichi's sure to be happy.

35
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,130
Taking these breaks
from training is useless!

36
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,610
That's the couple from
the next mountain over.

37
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,660
Mother, we're home!

38
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,630
I have a present for you.

39
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,330
Welcome home, Gohan<i>-chan.</i>

40
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,440
We sure worked up quite a sweat today.

41
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,280
Gohan, wanna hop in the tub with me?

42
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,450
Okay, Father.

43
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,460
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, will you join us?

44
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,130
Hey, Chichi, we'll be in the tub.

45
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,100
I've had enough already!

46
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,760
This ain't even funny!

47
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,100
You don't make Gohan<i>-chan</i> study,

48
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,300
and spend all day doin'
nothin' but trainin' with Piccolo!

49
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,110
As for me, I was just chased by a wild boar,

50
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,310
and had a real terrible time of it!

51
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,640
Yet with you, Goku<i>-sa,</i> you
play all ya want without any fuss!

52
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,680
You know, sometimes I see the
husband from the next mountain over,

53
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,280
an' how they have a nice Air Car
they use for fetchin' their shoppin' in!

54
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,790
But we don't have that kind of car,

55
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,060
and even so, I ain't got a license.

56
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,130
So, you can just get one!

57
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:18,730
These days I bet you're the only one
who don't have a single license, Goku<i>-sa</i>!

58
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,300
Piccolo ain't got one.

59
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,300
You expect I would have such a thing?!

60
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,070
So then, starting tomorrow,

61
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,740
you both are goin' to the driving
institute in town and learnin'!

62
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,480
It'll be a good chance for you two
to expand your knowledge of the world.

63
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,480
W-What?!

64
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,810
H-Hold on, Chichi, this is so sudden!

65
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,680
No more discussin' it!

66
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,820
Startin' tomorrow, you two
are takin' a break from trainin',

67
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,190
and you're gonna start goin' to the institute!

68
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,060
If you don't, neither
of you get anythin' to eat!

69
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,090
You got that?!

70
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:04,610
So this is the institute
that Chichi was talking about?

71
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,280
I don't see why you had to bring me into this.

72
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,920
Sorry, sorry. The truth just kind of slipped out.

73
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,720
Let's just get our licenses
quick and go back to training.

74
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,460
Well, I suppose that's the only way.

75
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,090
You know, the power of that earthling,

76
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,760
silencing the strongest man
in the universe, is formidable.

77
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,270
Which one of you is Goku<i>-san</i>, then?

78
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,770
That's me.

79
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,280
You will be under my supervision.

80
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,280
I hope you will treat me well...

81
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you okay, old timer?

82
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,490
I'm fine, I'm fine! This
happens all the time, after all.

83
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:55,760
Then you must be Piccolo<i>-san,</i>
whom I will be supervising, right?

84
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,100
So now, I will first
demonstrate what it is to drive,

85
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,440
so please watch carefully.

86
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,880
<i>I'm supposed to learn</i>
<i>driving from this chatterbox?</i>

87
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,780
Don't forget your seatbelt.

88
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,790
Dammit...

89
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,800
What?!

90
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,800
Here we go!

91
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,800
Open your eyes wide and watch closely!

92
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,260
W-What is the deal with this woman?!

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,440
What incredible speed...

94
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,170
Well, why don't we get going too...

95
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,410
Forgive me, but Son<i>-san</i>, wasn't it?

96
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,120
Could I get you to open my door?

97
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,590
Vegeta<i>-chan</i> hasn't shown
himself around here lately.

98
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,430
Mama misses him.

99
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,400
For some reason, he seems to be
staying overnight inside the spaceship.

100
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,570
You know, those Saiyans have
such wonderfully tough bodies.

101
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,110
Lately, he's been training
under a gravity of 400g.

102
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,450
He can do that because
he's a deviant maniac for battle.

103
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,480
<i>Damn. You just watch this, Kakarrot!</i>

104
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,280
I wonder how Father
and Piccolo<i>-san</i> are doing.

105
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,920
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

106
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,960
How admirable, Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

107
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,260
You've been studyin' hard all along, right?

108
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,930
Thanks to Goku<i>-sa</i> and Piccolo,
you've gotten so far behind, you know?

109
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,440
While those nuisances are out of our way,

110
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,140
study up as much as ya can!

111
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,220
You're tickling me, Haiya Dragon!

112
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,760
I've got an idea!

113
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,780
Nicely done, Piccolo<i>-san.</i>

114
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,270
Okay, try pulling out again.

115
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,100
Why don't you hurry and get going?

116
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,440
I've forgotten how to make it go.

117
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,580
Not again! You know, in
my 70 years as an instructor,

118
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,580
you're the only one to
have a memory this poor.

119
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,920
Sorry, old timer.

120
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,580
Try stepping on the accelerator.

121
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,120
Akuseru?

122
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,590
No, I took a bath before I came.

123
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,260
No, not <i>asekusai</i>, the accelerator!
[<i>asekusai</i>: smells of sweat]

124
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,060
There's a pedal under your right foot, see?

125
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,100
That's the accelerator. Next to it is the brake.

126
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,630
How long before you
finally remember this?

127
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,730
So that's it.

128
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,710
W-What?!

129
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,450
I made a mistake!

130
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,430
What are you doing?

131
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,730
Right now we're supposed
to be backing! Backing!

132
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,140
That's what I meant to do!

133
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,590
The brake! Step on the brake!

134
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,160
Let's see, the brake is on the left, so...

135
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,800
Cut in the steering handle!

136
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,800
Cut in the handle!

137
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,710
A-Are you sure?

138
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,150
Of course I am! Hurry up!

139
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,090
I cut it!

140
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,500
It's going to take you about
three years to get your license.

141
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,870
But I ain't got that much time!

142
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,250
See, if I don't train, then
the Artificial Humans will...

143
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,120
Idiot.

144
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,460
Over there, Haiya Dragon!

145
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,400
Ready? Go forward. Forward.

146
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,100
Right! Leave it to me!

147
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,770
All right, now press it down little by little...

148
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,080
Yahoo! I actually made it move forward!

149
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,110
Didn't I tell you just a little bit?

150
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,260
Goku! Are you trying to compete against me?!

151
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,960
Fine! I'm not losing to the likes of you!

152
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,800
That's the way, Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

153
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,790
Father!

154
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,480
You have quite a talent for this, Piccolo<i>-san.</i>

155
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,450
What?!

156
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,300
Hang on...

157
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,320
These Air Cars sure are dangerous.

158
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,450
Very well, today we'll start
teaching you on public roads.

159
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,890
If you start driving
recklessly like you were earlier,

160
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,060
we will immediately expel you.

161
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,500
You can't possibly get your license,
and I'm going to treat you as such.

162
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,580
See here! Don't take your
hands off the steering handle!

163
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,420
Minus one point.

164
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,420
Just a second now...

165
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,750
You mustn't look to the side!

166
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,760
Looking sideways is minus two points.

167
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,130
You're kidding!

168
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,900
You can't stop suddenly like that!

169
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,600
What about the people following after you?

170
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,770
That's minus ten points!

171
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,980
I'm leaving this to you, Piccolo!

172
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,700
Thank you, mister! Good-bye!

173
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,030
See ya!

174
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,740
Sorry, old timer!

175
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,070
We didn't mean to slip out in
the middle of our practice like this.

176
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,580
Huh? Looks like I just can't
manage whatever it takes for driving.

177
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,910
Maybe I don't have the talent.

178
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,410
How can you say that?

179
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,520
So, you mean you'll let
us continue our practice?

180
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,090
You were marvelous! Marvelous!

181
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,820
I am so impressed by what you did!

182
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,260
Really? Well, let's get our practice
going again right away, old timer!

183
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,030
Out of the question.

184
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:46,760
There's nothing we can teach to you!

185
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,140
What?

186
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,070
S-So, our licenses?

187
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,570
What are you joking about?

188
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,880
With the power you two have,
you don't need licenses, do you?

189
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,110
It's the truth!

190
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:07,080
What did you say?!

191
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,620
You didn't get your license?!

192
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,460
N-No.

193
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,770
Mother!

194
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,400
Chichi! Are you okay?

195
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:32,080
<i>And so, in no time at all,</i>
<i>three years had passed.</i>

196
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,320
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, Goku<i>-sa,</i>
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, you all be careful!

197
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,750
You're sure you don't
wanna take lunch with you?

198
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:42,090
N-No, thank you.

199
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,750
Thanks anyway.

200
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,460
Well, let's go.

201
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,100
Because of the Artificial Humans,
the future I live in is a hellish world.

202
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,440
Too strong... They're too strong!

203
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:21,230
<i>Finally, the time for battle had come.</i>
<i>We're counting on you, Goku!</i>

204
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:24,100
<i>We're counting on you, Super Warriors!</i>

205
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

206
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

207
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,870
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

208
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,370
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

209
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,880
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

210
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

211
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

212
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,120
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

213
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,600
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

214
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

215
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

216
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

217
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

218
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,410
<i>So sorry.</i>

219
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

220
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

221
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,870
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

222
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,570
<i>Yajirobe's Sky Car has been shot down!</i>

223
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,540
<i>Was it the Artificial Humans?</i>
<i>I didn't sense their ki at all!</i>

224
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,250
<i>This is bad. We'll just have to</i>
<i>search them out visually. Damn...</i>

225
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,450
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

226
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,590
<i>"Murderers Who Leave No Trace –</i>
<i>Which Ones Are the Artificial Humans!?"</i>

227
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,190
<i>They've descended into the city!</i>

228
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:38,260
"Next time"
"Murderers Who Leave No Trace–
Which Ones Are the Artificial Humans!?"
