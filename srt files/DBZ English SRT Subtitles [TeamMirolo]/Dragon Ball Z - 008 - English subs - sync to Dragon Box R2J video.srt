Dirty brat! Give me trouble, will you?

However, this is the

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,810
I can't do anythin' at all with Goku<i>-sa</i>!

27
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,240
I'm sure that right now, he's
keepin' Gohan up, no doubt about it!

28
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,750
And right now is the most
important time for him, too!

29
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,950
With everyone gathered at the Kame House,

30
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,790
there's not a single person who
can serve as a good example for Gohan!

31
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,090
Goku<i>-sa</i> has to know that it's not good
for him from an educational standpoint!

32
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,600
I can see from this how
Gohan's future is goin' to be.

33
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,720
<i>I've really had it this time.</i>

Eat some more. We've got
barbecued elephant this time...

No need to be shy. You can

<i>Goku...</i>

<i>Nobody would have</i>
<i>been able to tell them, right?</i>

41
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,810
Wah! It's too bright!

42
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:48,160
I can't get down! And I'm hungry!

43
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,760
If you're hungry, you can just climb
down from there and find something to eat.

44
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,700
What? You couldn't tell them?

45
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,830
I'm very sorry.

46
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,770
Don't tell me you didn't say anything!

47
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,940
No...

48
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,050
What's the use?
Geez, you're so spineless!

49
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,720
T-That's easy for you to say,

50
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,620
but if any normal person saw Chichi<i>-san</i>'s face,

51
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,790
they'd be unable to tell her!

52
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,620
Oh? So you're saying
that I'm no normal person?!

53
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,930
T-That's not what I meant...

54
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,560
Well, I suppose it's no surprise.

55
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,760
But we can't just keep quiet like this.

56
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,330
If we wrote her a letter
explaining what happened,

57
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,140
perhaps she would understand.

58
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,340
R-Right! That will work!

59
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:40,640
By the way, Kuririn,
what about the Dragon Balls?

60
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,840
There were two of them
at Son<i>-kun</i>'s house, right?

61
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,150
I forgot.

62
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,520
You're good for nothing!

63
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,460
I wonder what happened to Kuririn.

64
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,970
Chichi, don't get so worked-up,
I tell ya. Kuririn was just–

65
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,940
Pa, would you shut up?!

66
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,770
He told me he'd be sure
to be back by nighttime!

67
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,880
Goku ain't been to the
Kame House in a long time.

68
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,780
He must've just accidentally lost
track of time talkin' about the old days!

69
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,950
That may be fine for Goku<i>-sa,</i>
but Gohan has his cram school!

70
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,960
D-Don't be silly!
Gohan is four years old!

71
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,960
It won't hurt for him to
skip just one day of cram school.

72
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,790
You're too soft, Pa!

73
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,600
In these coming times, it's
those who can study that will win out!

74
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:46,740
Chichi! Chichi! I ain't fastened in!

75
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,760
I wonder if this is it...

76
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,370
Hey there, it's finally finished!

77
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,880
How nice of you guys to be
napping around at a time like this!

78
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,590
Now then, you there,
Grandpa Turtle, stand on up.

79
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,930
G-Grandpa Turtle?

80
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:44,570
I changed the display numbers
to make it easier to understand.

81
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,740
Let's see, 139...

82
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,080
139? I'm not as young as that!

83
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,710
This is the number that represents
your strength, Muten Roshi<i>-sama.</i>

84
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,450
The number that represents my strength?
Whoa, that's an incredible device.

85
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,890
It can even tell that?

86
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,800
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>, what would my number be?

87
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,600
Amazing! It says 206!

88
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:22,270
Muten Roshi<i>-sama,</i>
I really have surpassed you, huh?

89
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,670
H-Hey, are you sure it's not malfunctioning?

90
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,080
Malfunctioning?

91
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,550
That could not be.

92
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,290
Just 0.001!

93
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,860
It's not malfunctioning, all right!

94
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,700
Yahoo!

95
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,030
Is that right?

96
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,800
I don't mean to brag,
but when it comes to my skills–

97
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,640
Hey! Hey!

98
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,170
Who could it be, this early?

99
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,270
Hey, I say, hey! Hey!

100
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,540
Hey! Hey!

101
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,680
Who's out here calling to us so unusually?

102
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,150
It's me!

103
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,290
Y-You're that guy who was at
Karin<i>-sama</i>'s place, as I recall–Armadillo!

104
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,190
That's Yajirobe, ya dumb bastard!

105
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,260
I'll just betcha ya got
my name wrong on purpose!

106
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,630
What're ya doin' buildin'
a house way out here?

107
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,690
Makes it a real hassle to find.

108
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,870
I came here at Karin's
askin' to give ya a message.

109
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,870
A message from Karin<i>-sama</i>?

110
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,670
"I know the whole situation," he says.

111
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,370
So you, along with that Yamucha guy,

112
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,510
and that Ten-whatever-guy
and Chaozu are to come immediately.

113
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,250
Everyone is to go to Karin-to Tower?

114
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,080
What for?

115
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:45,690
Kami<i>-sama</i>, see, is gonna give us trainin',
he says. I'm in there with ya too.

116
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,860
R-Really?!

117
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,720
Yeah. For my part,

118
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,860
I told 'em that I don't wanna
fight no whatever-their-face-is aliens,

119
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,870
but they says I gotta do it no
matter what. I've had it with 'em.

120
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,880
U-Understood! I'll go find
everyone and head there right away!

121
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,710
Catch ya later. I told ya
everythin', that's for sure.

122
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,580
Oh yeah, right. I forgot.

123
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,790
Goku says not to bring him
back to life 'fore those enemies come.

124
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,120
W-Why not?

125
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,060
He says he's gonna train in the Other World.

126
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,560
If ya wanna know details,

127
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,970
some old hag named Uranai Baba's
supposed to be along pretty soon. Ask her.

128
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,570
W-What? When?

129
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,770
T-Training in the Other World?

130
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,780
O-Of all things!

131
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,910
Huh?

132
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,520
He turned around again.

133
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,820
It's a different kind of plane.

134
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,330
Ahoy! Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>!

135
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,470
It's Chichi and Gyumao!

136
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:15,610
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>, what do we do?!

137
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,480
I still haven't written their letter!

138
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,530
Muten Roshi<i>-sama,</i>

139
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:41,480
it's been a terribly long time!
Have you been well?

140
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,710
I-I suppose so.

141
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,510
–Y-Yikes...
–Y-Yikes...

142
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:51,350
My Goku<i>-sa</i> and Gohan
are supposed to be here!

143
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,520
Where are they?
Are they inside the house?

144
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,390
U-Um, the f-fact of the matter is...

145
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,470
He was taken away by Piccolo Daimao?!

146
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,640
W-What happened to Goku?!

147
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,840
He d-died...

148
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,020
Chichi! Steady!

149
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,030
Hey! Hey!

150
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,470
Let me down!

151
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,710
Hey!

152
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,210
They're gone...

153
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:05,950
Mother... Father... I can't get down...

154
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,270
What have we here?

155
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:11,390
You don't have to run away.
I won't do anything mean to you.

156
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,010
Hold on...

157
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,720
Ah, so that's how you get down. But still...

158
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,890
I want to get down!

159
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,600
Urinating, huh?

160
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,970
Why is this happening to me?

161
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,610
Why is it this bright out?

162
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,610
It's the moon!

163
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,250
Wow! It's completely round!

164
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,650
This is the first time
I've ever seen a full moo–

165
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,830
What is it?

166
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,350
What?!

167
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,660
I-Impossible!

168
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,550
What's going on?! He's got
extraordinary destructive power!

169
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,440
A-At this rate, Earth will be annihilated
before the Saiyans even get here!

170
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,500
How can this be?

171
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,180
Don't play stupid! It is
when the moon is at its fullest

172
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,350
that we Saiyans are
at our best, you know!

173
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,920
<i>That's it!</i>

174
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,760
<i>It's the full moon!</i>

175
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,560
Get lost!

176
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,270
T-To think that he could transform!
It must be his Saiyan blood.

177
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,340
I get the feeling that I've discovered
the secret to him and Son Goku's strength.

178
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,850
Looks like blowing the moon
away was the right thing to do.

179
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,660
I shudder to think of those Saiyan
guys turning into monsters like that.

180
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,730
He said something
or other about their tails,

181
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,400
but it appears that both the tails
and a full moon are required to transform.

182
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,630
Maybe I'll pull out his tail, too.

183
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,570
There's no need to worry
about him transforming like this,

184
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,480
but Saiyan tails seem
to be their weak spots.

185
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,510
All right, then.

186
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,540
I think I'll provide him clothes
and a sword at no charge...

187
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,720
I'll let you have the
same design as your father's.

188
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,300
Although the character
may be a little different.

189
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,600
I have to go do my own
training. I'm leaving now.

190
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,440
If you can survive here without
anything happening to you for six months,

191
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,610
I, Piccolo<i>-sama</i>, will personally
put you through some hellish training!

192
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,850
So much so that you'll come to
believe you'd be better off dying!

193
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,650
Brace yourself!

194
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,450
I'll also turn you into an
outstanding Demon Clansman!

195
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,560
<i>The goal is to bring down the Saiyans.</i>
<i>Separated by time and space,</i>

196
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:29,330
<i>the harsh trials that both the sleeping</i>
<i>father and son must face, continue on and on.</i>

197
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,520
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

198
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,390
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

199
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,760
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

200
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,260
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

201
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,740
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

202
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,840
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

203
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,350
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

204

<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

205
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,490
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

206
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,590
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

207
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,430
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

208
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,500
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

209
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:45,170
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

210
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,340
<i>So sorry.</i>

211
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,450
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

212
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,420
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

213
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,240
<i>Hello, I'm Gohan.</i>

214
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,040
<i>Father, I met a robot in</i>
<i>the middle of the desert.</i>

215
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,610
<i>Oh, yeah? What kind of robot?</i>

216
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,610
<i>A crabby one. But he really is nice.</i>

217
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,280
<i>Lucky you, Gohan. I know it</i>
<i>may be rough, but hang in there.</i>

218
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,380
<i>Right!</i>

219
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,380
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

220

<i>"Sorry, Robot-san –</i>
<i>The Desert of Vanishing Tears."</i>

221
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,660
<i>Still, I miss Mother.</i>

222
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,100
"Next time"
"Sorry, Robot<i>-san –</i>
The Desert of Vanishing Tears"
