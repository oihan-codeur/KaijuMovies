<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,060
<i>There is one minute</i>
<i>until Planet Namek explodes!</i>

17
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:10,410
<i>Thanks to Super Shen Long, Gohan</i>
<i>and the others were able to return to Earth.</i>

18
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,870
Very well, I will make it clear to you.

19
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,070
I am the one who is going to survive!

20
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,880
Before this planet explodes,

21
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,760
I will defeat this guy with my own hands!

22
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,360
<i>"Pathos of Freeza! Once He</i>
<i>Starts Shaking, He's Unstoppable!!"</i>

23
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,080
There's no way I'm going to lose to a monkey!

24
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,090
Not to a mere Saiyan monkey!

25
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,540
Goku! Goku!

26
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,210
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what has happened?

27
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,410
It's even! Goku is matching
up evenly against Freeza!

28
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,890
However, there's under a minute
left until Planet Namek explodes.

29
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,890
If the fight continues like this,
it'll be just what Freeza wants.

30
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,420
What exactly do you mean?

31
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,030
Freeza, as emperor of the universe,

32
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,400
has likely never had a foe that has
given him as hard a time as Goku has.

33
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,410
When Freeza got anxious
during his fight with Goku...

34
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,710
I can survive even in the vacuum of space.

35
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,750
But you Saiyans cannot live there.

36
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,090
Disappear, together with the planet!

37
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,090
Father!!

38
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,070
But Planet Namek was
not immediately destroyed.

39
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,600
I restrained my power too much, did I?

40
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:30,270
That's because you were fearful of
being caught in the explosion of the planet.

41
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,940
As a result, I've hung on to life.

42
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,640
Hung on to life, you say?

43
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,620
You don't seem to understand at all, do you?

44
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,220
You have avoided the
planet's instantaneous explosion,

45
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,690
but I've completely destroyed its core.

46
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,390
Do you understand what that means?

47
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,560
Five more minutes!

48
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,700
Five more minutes, and then Planet
Namek will undergo a great explosion,

49
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,400
vanishing into space dust!

50
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,210
The better part of that five
minutes has already passed!

51
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,910
There's no more time!

52
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,580
When Planet Namek is
destroyed, Goku dies too.

53
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,420
However, Freeza will remain alive.
He can survive in any location!

54
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,700
How's that?!

55
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,570
I am not losing to the
likes of a lowlife Saiyan!!

56
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:41,080
Not to a mere Saiyan!

57
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,750
Y-You monkey!!

58
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,060
What is that you're doing, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

59
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,920
Fortune-telling!

60
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,920
I was taught how to do
this when I was a child.

61
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,030
When you wish for a
traveler to return home safely,

62
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:08,260
you lay three leaves inside
a circular ring and burn them.

63
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,070
It's said that if the
leaves burn completely up,

64
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,600
the traveler will return safely.

65
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,910
Oh? We're foretelling
what Goku<i>-san</i> will do, right?

66
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,600
See? They're burning!

67
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,570
I'm sure they'll all burn up!

68
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,240
Goku<i>-san</i> is coming back, isn't he?

69
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,080
That's right! This fortune is sure to come true!

70
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,750
Telling fortunes is nonsense!

71
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:05,590
Father is certain to come back!

72
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,890
You're right!

73
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,770
Father will beat Freeza,
and certainly come back!

74
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:33,110
Dammit! How long must I be
bothered with the likes of this Saiyan?!

75
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,390
How's that, you monkey scum?!

76
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,540
Is this all you've got?

77
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,070
What?!

78
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,210
I asked you if this is all you've got!

79
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,410
Enough impudence!!

80
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,730
You monkey scum!

81
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:55,410
<i>Not to the likes of a Saiyan...!</i>

82
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,100
Dammit!

83
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:55,770
I'll repay you for this
ten-fold–no, a hundred-fold!

84
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,830
I'm stopping.

85
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:02,500
W-What was that?!

86
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,840
Stopping, you said?

87
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,780
What has happened?

88
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,530
W-What do you mean, you're stopping?

89
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:34,040
In reaction to your using
your 100 percent power,

90
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,540
you've passed your peak,
and your <i>ki</i> is falling rapidly.

91
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,540
I've begun to think that it's
useless to fight you any further.

92
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,550
I'm already feeling satisfied,
and your sense of pride is in tatters!

93
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,050
After all, someone has come
forward and surpassed you,

94
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,450
when no one in the world was
supposed to have been able to.

95
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,120
And what's more, that someone...

96
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,760
...was a mere Saiyan!

97
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,160
There ain't any reason to kill you,
now that you've started trembling.

98
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,170
You should go on living with the shock
you have undergone here, in tranquility.

99
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,040
I'm going back to Earth.

100
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,070
I can still barely make it in time.

101
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,380
Freeza, don't you misbehave any more!

102
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,090
I don't want to see your face again.

103
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,060
Don't mock me!

104
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,090
Don't you mock me!

105
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,540
A-Am I...

106
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,510
Am I...

107
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:52,750
...to have lost?!

108
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:21,580
You're an impossible fool!

109
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,450
I had given you one last chance!

110
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,200
It will pursue you no matter how far you go,

111
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,070
and cut through any substance!

112
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,540
That this should be your final technique!

113
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,410
You disappoint me, Freeza!

114
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,550
Hmph! I see through your strategy!

115
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:43,050
You'll come toward me, evading at the
last moment and causing it to hit me, right?

116
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,790
You think I would fall for
such a worthless tactic?!

117
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,060
Goku, there's no time!

118
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,430
Planet Namek is going to explode!

119
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,610
Father!!

120
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,060
<i>Only moments remain until</i>
<i>Planet Namek's great explosion.</i>

121
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:28,760
<i>Will the goddess of victory</i>
<i>smile on Goku? Or will it be Freeza?</i>

122
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

123
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

124
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

125
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

126
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

127
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

128
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

129
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

130
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

131
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

132
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

133
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

134
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

135
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

136
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

137
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

138
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,200
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

139
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,340
<i>Somehow or other, I'm going back to Earth.</i>

140
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,170
<i>Freeza, you're going to share</i>
<i>the same fate as this planet,</i>

141
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,040
<i>which you yourself have destroyed.</i>

142
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,510
<i>Goku! What are you dawdling around for?!</i>

143
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,880
<i>Hurry and take off! Take off!</i>

144
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,880
