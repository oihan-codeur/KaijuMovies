<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,090
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,730

<i>Majin Boo was beginning to</i>

24
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,710
<i>However, two gunshots changed everything!</i>

25
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,350
Satan...!

26
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:29,950
Run away! Take the dog... far away! You'll die!!

27
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,340
<i>Boo's intense anger had given</i>
<i>birth to another, purely evil Boo.</i>

28
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:23,340
<i>There are two Majin Boos!</i>
<i>What is going to happen to the Earth?!</i>

29
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,720
<i>"Which One Will Win!?</i>
<i>A Good-and-Evil Boo-Boo Confrontation."</i>

30
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,700
Who are you?!

31
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,540
Who are <i>you</i>?!

32
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,080
–I'm Majin Boo!
–I'm Majin Boo!

33
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,590
Th-There are two Majin Boos!
W-What is going on?!

34
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:46,630
H-Hang in there, Majin Boo!
What are you doing, Majin Boo?!

35
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:50,590
Get him! Get him, Majin Boo!
Don't you lose, Majin Boo!

36
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,800
They're both Majin Boo, huh?
That sure makes it hard to root for him.

37
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,480
What does this mean, exactly?

38
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,820
I feel a tremendously evil <i>ki</i> coming
from the new one that came out.

39
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,990
It's probable that the evil part within Boo
has surged up and has been spewed out!

40
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:46,400
Nice going, Boo! Attaway! Keep it up like that!

41
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,210
This is bad! There's no
chance the original Boo can win!

42
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,380
When they split in two, the evil Boo
took most of their power with him!

43
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,380
At this rate...!

44
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,060
You must be tired, Goten. Here, drink up!

45
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,640
Trunks! Goten! What are you doing?
We're going to train right now!

46
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,650
Again? I want to rest a little.
We just barely got back here.

47
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,610
You saw the power we had
during our Fusion, right?!

48
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,700
Leave the destruction of Boo to us!

49
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,950
Don't get so full of yourself!

50
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,700
We must make your
Fusion even more impeccable!

51
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,870
Your power is still not enough!

52
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,040
There's no time to be playing around!

53
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,960
If things continue, everyone
will be done in by this new Boo!

54
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,960
Piccolo, what are you lordin'
it over on them so much for?!

55
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,130
Don't go bullyin' Goten around just
because you figure Goku-<i>sa</i> is gone!

56
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,550
B-Bullying?

57
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,140
That's right! Who do you think you are?!

58
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,060
Goten and Trunks are still children!

59
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,310
This is usually the time they'd
be takin' their naps, you know!

60
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,640
If you keep up nothing but
their special training like this,

61
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,230
then when the time comes,
they'll be all tired out and get beaten!

62
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,820
Let them rest for a little while!

63
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,570
A-All right. So then, for a
short while, we'll take a break.

64
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,820
But after you've rested a bit, we're
going to train even harder than before!

65
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,410
Yeah!

66
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,240
–I'm hungry! Let's go eat something, Goten!
–Yeah!

67
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,620
Don't go overdoin' it, Goten!
You're still a child, after all!

68
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,210
In a pinch, you can leave
the fightin' up to the adults!

69
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,800
Okay, mother!

70
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,800
You too, Trunks! Got it?

71
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,800
I got it!

72
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,220
Will that be all right, do you think?

73
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:45,640
There's still one day left before the
appointed time. We'll manage something.

74
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,990
I-I'll turn you into chocolate!

75
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:43,190
H-He's turned into something
funny again! W-What's going on?!

76
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,540
W-What is this?!

77
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,880
Goten, don't panic! Stay calm! Stay calm!

78
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,720
Huh?

79
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,230
What's that?

80
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:05,240
It's coming from Earth, huh?

81
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,820
Is that Majin Boo?

82
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,760
<i>That's an incredible ki! I wonder</i>
<i>what in the world is happening on Earth.</i>

83
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,520
H-How can this be?!

84
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,650
Hey, Piccolo, what was that just now?

85
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,900
Majin Boo has transformed!

86
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,660
Thanks to some foolish Earthling,
he has become pure evil,

87
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,830
and his body is now more suited to fighting.

88
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,630
Th-This... This means...!

89
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,920
W-What, Piccolo? Don't tell
me this means more trouble!

90
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,140
I-It's all right! Trunks and
Goten have their Fusion!

91
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,770
Goku said Fusion was the
strongest there is, didn't he?

92
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,830
This <i>ki</i> is enormous!
What in the world is happening?

93
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,580
A good question.

94
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,220
U-Um,

95
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,100
can I ask you to please
power me up a little faster?

96
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,730
At this rate, the Earth itself,
which I have to save, will be lost!

97
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:54,110
Don't worry so. I'm doing it full-tilt.

98
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,820
I don't expect that you are.

99
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,570
Die!!

100
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,280
He's gone! He's gone! H-He was afraid!

101
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,210
He was afraid of me,
Mister Satan, and ran away!

102
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,710
I know it! I know he did!

103
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,590
That's only right! I am the
strongest man in the world!

104
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,840
Not even Majin Boo is so
reckless that he would fight with me!

105
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,940
H-He heard that...!

106
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,990
Sa... tan...

107
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:57,020
B-Boo... We're saved...!
He still remembers me...!

108
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:24,170
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, what do you
suppose will happen to the Earth now?

109
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,640
In any case, all we can do is
strengthen Trunks and Goten.

110
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,810
Those two half-pints are the
last card we have left to play.

111
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,230
Once the break is over,
we'll begin training immediately!

112
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,490
I'm full, I'm full!

113
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,580
Now that my stomach is full,
I've become sleepy.

114
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,750
Me too! How about we take a nap?

115
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,160
Yeah!

116
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,170
Trunks, before you take a nap,
make sure you take a shower!

117
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,170
Goten! Same goes for you!

118
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,590
Yeah, we know.

119
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,130
–Trunks-<i>kun</i>, let's take one together!
–No way, take it by yourself!

120
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,220
What's the matter, Piccolo?!

121
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,510
He's coming! He's headed for this temple!

122
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,780
Ah, hell!

123
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:14,320
This Majin Boo is able to seek out our <i>ki</i>!

124
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:44,310
<i>Majin Boo, having become the very essence</i>
<i>of evil, has at length intruded at the temple!</i>

125
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,650
<i>Gohan is still in the middle of his training.</i>

126
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,020
<i>Is there anything that can actually be done?</i>

127
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,950
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

128
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,540
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

129
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,090
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

130
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,180
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

131
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:09,190
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

132
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,570
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

133
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,450
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

134
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:27,500
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

135
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,040
<i>Even now?</i>

136
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,720
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

137
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,100
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

138
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:48,560
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

139
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:58,610
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

140
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,010
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

141
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,340
<i>It's no use. If we let Boo fight</i>
<i>Goten and Trunks now, they can't win.</i>

142
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,300
<i>What are we supposed to do?</i>

143
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,350
<i>We have to buy some time</i>
<i>somehow. If we had just one hour,</i>

144
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,390
<i>we could get them to train</i>
<i>in the Room of Spirit and Time.</i>

145
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,440
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

146
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,730
<i>"A No-Timeout Catastrophe!!</i>
<i>Earth's Humanity Exterminated."</i>

147
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,230
<i>How could this happen?</i>

148
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,610
<i>The remaining people on</i>
