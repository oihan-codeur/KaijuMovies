<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:24,465
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:29,725
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,765 --> 00:00:36,485
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:43,075
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:51,915
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

15
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,745
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:47,275
<i>Goku and Cell had reached their full power.</i>

17
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:51,485
<i>The highest level of battle had begun.</i>

18
00:03:26,895 --> 00:03:32,285
You've suddenly appeared
and vanished before, as well.

19
00:03:32,325 --> 00:03:36,575
Instantaneous Movement. I can do it.

20
00:03:48,335 --> 00:03:50,755
And when it comes to speed,
I'm pretty sure of myself.

21
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:56,135
Although, I can't keep up
with Instantaneous Movement.

22
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:05,645
<i>"Defeat or Death!?</i>
<i>Goku's Turnabout Ploy."</i>

23
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:11,625
Awesome! They're ridiculously fast!

24
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:35,405
W-Wha–What a fight this must be...

25
00:05:51,255 --> 00:05:52,585
Goku!

26
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:17,275
Th-They've vanished...

27
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:41,465
W-Where... where could
the two of them have gone?

28
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:55,985
All in all, those guys are
incredibly fast, both of them!

29
00:07:12,915 --> 00:07:15,965
You're pretty good, really.

30
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:20,885
I honestly didn't think you
would entertain me this much.

31
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:22,465
Me, too.

32
00:07:22,505 --> 00:07:25,765
This is the way a fight has to be.

33
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:31,355
Now then, I think it's about time we got going.

34
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:37,445
Over there!

35
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:39,575
That broken up area there!

36
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:44,075
They're hiding there,
using some camouflage as a trick!

37
00:07:47,495 --> 00:07:51,165
A-Ah, so that's it!

38
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,625
No matter what tricks they
may use, they cannot fool my eyes!

39
00:07:55,665 --> 00:08:00,675
That's our Mister Satan, the
greatest combat sportsman in the world!

40
00:08:15,475 --> 00:08:18,145
O-Over there...

41
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:28,285
They're up there, huh, Mister Satan?

42
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,295
Cameraman! Above us! Above us!

43
00:08:33,335 --> 00:08:35,245
R-Right!

44
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:44,305
–We can't see anything!
–What is this? We can't tell what's going on!

45
00:08:44,345 --> 00:08:47,215
What happened to Satan? Where's Satan?!

46
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:51,605
We want to see Satan defeat Cell!

47
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:54,605
Put Satan on! Satan!

48
00:08:54,645 --> 00:08:56,435
Yeah, yeah!

49
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:11,745
Their battle is already beyond the
point where a TV camera can capture it.

50
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:31,935
Yes. Previous Kami-<i>sama</i> also stood there often,

51
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:34,765
observing status of Lower Realm.

52
00:09:35,895 --> 00:09:37,275
Is that so?

53
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:38,435
Yes.

54
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:44,065
No need strain yourself.

55
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:47,235
Previous Kami-<i>sama</i> also concentrated

56
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:51,615
until clearly understood Lower Realm situation.

57
00:09:52,825 --> 00:10:00,045
Use less force. Feel out <i>ki,</i>
like differentiating quiet sounds.

58
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:11,805
Goku-<i>san</i> is fighting. It's an incredible fight...

59
00:10:13,635 --> 00:10:16,515
Yes. Now you got it.

60
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,995
W-Watch out!

61
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:19,035
F-Father...!

62
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:59,375
This is a magnificent fight!

63
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:03,545
I would hate to let it end
due to an out-of-bounds defeat.

64
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:09,425
Let's remove the out-of-bounds
defeat from the rules.

65
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:12,635
It doesn't hold any meaning for us.

66
00:12:16,515 --> 00:12:20,805
What...? What do you intend to do?

67
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:38,615
Everybody! Get away from the ring!!

68
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:41,635
Phew, that was close...!

69
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:51,645
Th-Thanks so much...

70
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:56,275
You guys should go home already.

71
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:57,615
You're in the way here.

72
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:03,375
W-We can't very well do that.

73
00:14:03,415 --> 00:14:08,295
After this, our Mister Satan
is going to be fighting, after all.

74
00:14:08,335 --> 00:14:10,505
Right, Mister Satan?

75
00:14:12,915 --> 00:14:14,925
Satan-<i>sama</i>?

76
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,135
O-Of course I am!

77
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:25,185
But then, maybe we should watch
from a little bit further distance.

78
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:44,205
Now, the whole land is our ring.

79
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:47,875
Whoever loses will now be determined
only by surrendering or dying.

80
00:14:47,915 --> 00:14:51,585
I get it. You want to fight all-out.

81
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,465
That is what is most appropriate
for a fight between you and I.

82
00:14:55,505 --> 00:14:56,885
All right.

83
00:14:59,925 --> 00:15:05,635
Now then, what do you say we
make full use of this expanse right away?

84
00:15:20,325 --> 00:15:25,455
C-Cameraman, move forward
some more. More, more, more, more!

85
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,915
R-Right...!

86
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,455
What are they doing?!

87
00:15:32,495 --> 00:15:34,665
We can't see anything!

88
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:56,485
N-No, there's no malfunction, our
courageous announcer and cameraman

89
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:59,865
are providing special coverage from the site...

90
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:03,985
Yes... yes... if you could
please just wait a little longer...

91
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:07,285
No, that's not what I meant... Yes...

92
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,665
Yes, Z-TV...

93
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:35,685
S-Such extraordinary shockwaves!
W-What in the world could this be?

94
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,655
Satan-<i>sama</i>...?

95
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:42,115
T-Tricks! Tricks...

96
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:21,405
I-It's trembling... The ground is trembling!

97
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:25,575
Mister Satan, could this be a trick, too?

98
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:41,335
I-Incredible!

99
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:45,755
It's not just speed, neither one of
them is falling behind on power, either!

100
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:37,895
Incredible, incredible,
incredible, incredible, incredible!

101
00:18:37,935 --> 00:18:42,275
No, hold on–don't!
Not like that, there, there, there!

102
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:46,735
You got him! No, not like that! Got him!

103
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:52,995
That's the way! That's the way! Go! Go! Go!

104
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:56,625
Go–

105
00:18:56,665 --> 00:19:00,625
You're here, are you?
How long have you...?

106
00:19:03,335 --> 00:19:07,635
What a fierce battle.

107
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:10,845
What's more, even though a good deal
of time has passed since the fight started,

108
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:14,515
neither one of those two's
<i>ki</i> has dropped hardly at all.

109
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:18,555
If Cell is a monster, then
Son Goku is also a monster.

110
00:19:56,845 --> 00:20:02,685
G-Goku... what are you planning
to do from way up that high?

111
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:06,945
<i>Ka... me...</i>

112
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,405
It's a <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>!

113
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:13,905
Is Goku thinking of launching
a <i>Kamehame-Ha</i> at full power?!

114
00:20:21,245 --> 00:20:24,915
You can't shoot a
<i>Kamehame-Ha</i> from that position!

115
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,625
If you did, it would be a disaster for the Earth!

116
00:20:30,255 --> 00:20:32,505
Th-There's no way he would shoot it.

117
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:36,385
If he did so from that position,
it would destroy the Earth.

118
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:39,935
<i>ha... me...</i>

119
00:20:41,685 --> 00:20:43,935
H-Hey...!

120
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:52,155
F-Father is planning to fire it!

121
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:00,955
Y-You wouldn't...!

122
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:12,795
Holy–!

123
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:14,925
<i>Ha</i>!!

124
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:21,705
<i>Finally, Goku's full power</i>
<i>Kamehame-Ha bursts forth!</i>

125
00:22:21,745 --> 00:22:26,495
<i>The goddess of victory has smiled upon Goku.</i>

126
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:28,585
<i>Or has she?</i>

127
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:48,765
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

128
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:54,605
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

129
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:56,985
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

130
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:05,495
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

131
00:23:07,785 --> 00:23:12,005
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

132
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:16,085
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

133
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:19,595
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

134
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:22,215
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

135
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:29,725
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

136
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:33,855
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

137
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:35,655
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

138
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:39,695
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

139
00:23:39,735 --> 00:23:45,365
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

140
00:23:45,405 --> 00:23:47,535
<i>So sorry.</i>

141
00:23:47,575 --> 00:23:52,665
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

142
00:23:55,415 --> 00:24:00,675
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

143
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:14,235
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

144
00:24:14,275 --> 00:24:17,985
<i>Cell is back up. Rats,</i>
<i>sure enough, he's still alive.</i>

145
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,155
<i>I knew that I'd beaten him too easily.</i>

146
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:22,275
<i>I'm sorry to say it but Goku can't win.</i>

147
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:24,825
<i>What's more, it looks like he</i>
<i>knows that while he as fighting.</i>

148
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:27,575
<i>I don't know what he has in mind.</i>

149
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:29,705
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

150
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:33,165
<i>"A Conclusion to the Deathmatch!!</i>
<i>Goku's Declaration of Surrender!?"</i>

151
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,755
<i>It can't be! Father, why?</i>

152
00:24:35,795 --> 00:24:38,295
"Next time"
"A Conclusion to the Deathmatch!!
Goku's Declaration of Surrender!?"
