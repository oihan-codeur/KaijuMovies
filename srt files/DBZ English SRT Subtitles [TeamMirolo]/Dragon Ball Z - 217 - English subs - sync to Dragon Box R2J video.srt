24
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,300
<i>Videl, having received Gohan's training,</i>
<i>should have won easily. However...</i>

25
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,780
Just what kind of mystery is hidden
within this unusual strength of Spopovitch's?

26
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:20,420
<i>"A Tragic Videl!!</i>
<i>Are You Coming Out, Angry Super Gohan?"</i>

27
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,720
H-How can this be?!
Contestant Spopovitch is also flying!

28
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,810
It can't be!

29
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,170
H-Hey, do you suppose this
flying thing is becoming a trend?

30
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:09,640
U-Unbelievable! He can do that? Spopovitch?

31
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,090
Absurd!

32
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,730
How is it he too can fly?

33
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,920
A <i>Kikoha</i> blast?!

34
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,210
<i>What kind of guy is this?!</i>

35
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,750
Th-That lousy creep!

36
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,590
It wasn't all that powerful,
but he used a <i>Kikoha</i> on her!

37
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,880
Not quite!

38
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,600
By killing her, he would lose.
He purposely kept the blast weak.

39
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,390
Why would he?

40
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:43,140
He seems to have a lot more power
than his own abilities can account for.

41
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:51,070
He shouldn't have the kind of power it takes
to use the Bukujutsu and <i>Kikoha</i> techniques.

42
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,610
So what does it all mean?

43
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:59,200
I don't know. How is it he
came to possess such power?

44
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,840
<i>I don't care who or what he is!</i>

45
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,590
<i>I'm Videl! I'm the daughter of</i>
<i>Mister Satan, who defeated Cell!</i>

46
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,220
<i>I am going to beat him for sure!</i>

47
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,250
Contestant Videl is down!
Was that the decisive blow?

48
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,970
Oh, Contestant Videl has not yet given up!

49
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,390
With her indomitable fighting
spirit, she's trying to get up.

50
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,020
W-Who were you expecting would give up?

51
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,360
What?!

52
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,600
Th-This is terrible!

53
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,060
What kind of guy is he?

54
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,060
Stop, already!

55
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,110
If this keeps up, it'll mess up Videl's face!

56
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,940
It doesn't look like she's going
to get off as easy as just that!

57
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,950
Hmm, they say my first round
opponent is a woman, so when I win,

58
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,540
I'd better not strike too much of a "guts pose"

59
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,540
or it'll look like I'm being sarcastic...

60
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,920
This would be playing it up
too much to the spectators.

61
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,470
Hmm. It sure is hard having
a woman for an opponent.

62
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,810
Mister Satan!

63
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,980
Videl-<i>san</i> is having the daylights
beaten out of her by Spopovitch!

64
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,980
You've misspoken.

65
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:36,440
You mean Spopovitch is having the
daylights beaten out of him by Videl.

66
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,450
No, that isn't...

67
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,570
I'm very busy right now!

68
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,620
I don't need these updates, just tell
me what the outcome of the match is.

69
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,000
The outcome that Videl has won, that is.

70
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,250
R-Right...

71
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,180
Don't toy with me!

72
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,360
Contestant Spopovitch
has thrown Contestant Videl!

73
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,610
This could be all for her. Defeat by Ringout!

74
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:24,660
<i>I-It's no use! I don't have the power left to fly.</i>

75
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,510
Oh! Contestant Spopovitch has saved
Contestant Videl from a Ringout loss!

76
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,180
What could he be thinking?

77
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,900
Videl-<i>san...</i>

78
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,480
He's just playing around now.

79
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,400
However, Contestant Videl is not getting up.

80
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,530
<i>Could she be unconscious?</i>
<i>Reluctantly, I must begin the count.</i>

81
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,950
That's enough! That's enough!
Just keep lying there like that.

82
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,770
Don't get up! You can't get up!

83
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,270
"Martial"

84
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,940
Oh, she's up! Contestant Videl has gotten up!

85
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,410
Such perseverance!
What wonderful force of mind!

86
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,490
She's gotten up...

87
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,630
It's senseless! He's out of
the ordinary! Concede, already!

88
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:15,770
V-Videl-<i>san</i>!

89
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,290
Th-This is terrible!

90
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,760
Contestant Spopovitch is beating
Contestant Videl black and blue!

91
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,670
That bastard...

92
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,890
That's enough! Please, concede, Videl-<i>san...</i>

93
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:28,760
I guess Videl-<i>san</i>'s match must
be over by now. That's too bad.

94
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,140
It's all right! Videl-<i>san</i>
will last until the final round,

95
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,140
so she has plenty of matches to go.

96
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,680
It's terrible, it's terrible!

97
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,770
Videl-<i>san</i> is getting beaten senseless!

98
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,150
What?!

99
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,820
Hurry up! With our support, we can
cheer some spirit back into Videl-<i>san</i>!

100
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,110
Yeah!

101
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,690
Dammit! Stop already!

102
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,440
Videl-<i>chan</i> is going to die!

103
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,170
You've held up long enough! Concede!

104
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,590
Concede, already! Videl-<i>san</i>!

105
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,690
Videl-<i>san</i>, I agree with what
the Great Saiyaman-<i>san</i> is saying.

106
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,110
Don't you think it best if you concede?

107
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,610
N-No way!

108
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,570
I'll never concede!

109
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,790
W-Why are you being so stubborn?!

110
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:22,120
You're really going to get killed here!

111
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,420
He's not holding back because you're a girl,
he doesn't have that kind of compassion!

112
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,920
That's awful! How could he?!

113
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,480
V-Videl!

114
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,100
You bastard!

115
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:29,440
Damn you! Any more and I'll arrest you!

116
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,530
H-Hey, Gohan, relax!

117
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,490
It's all right, she ain't going to die.

118
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,810
Th-This is terrible! Contestant Spopovitch,

119
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,770
I can't believe these are
the actions of a human being!

120
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,060
A-Ain't there anythin' left that can be done?

121
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,570
If this keeps up, that girl will be
dead before she marries Gohan!

122
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,150
Gohan...

123
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,250
<i>No!</i>

124
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,460
<i>I don't... I don't want to lose!</i>

125
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,520
Why you... You're going to
pay now. You damned bastard!

126
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,080
H-Hey!

127
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,080
This isn't right! Calm down, Gohan!

128
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,960
No way!

129
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,430
Stop!!

130
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,760
The goofing around ends now, Spopovitch!

131
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,780
I don't believe this is what we came here to do.

132
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,740
Hurry up and win!

133
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,010
R-Ringout! Contestant Spopovitch wins.

134
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,510
Videl-<i>san</i>!

135
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,810
Um, should I call for a stretcher?

136
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,940
No, I'll carry her.

137
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,030
Spopovitch!

138
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:35,880
You'll pay for this! Every last bit of you!

139
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,210
You got that?!

140
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,970
Kuririn, do you have any <i>senzu</i>?

141
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,810
No. We all came here half for the fun of it, so...

142
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,360
I see. All right.

143
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,730
I'll go up to where
Karin-<i>sama</i> is and bring some back.

144
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,870
Relax, Gohan! Goku has just
gone off to get some <i>senzu</i>!

145
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,410
<i>Senzu</i>? Really? All right!

146
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:16,040
W-W-What?!

147
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,040
Videl has massive injuries and was defeated?

148
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,420
Y-Yes.

149
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,710
B-But that's impossible!

150
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,010
Videl should be the strongest
in the world, second only to me!

151
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,930
That fool! She must have got caught up
in her techniques and dropped her guard!

152
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:41,020
Videl! Videl!

153
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,150
Videl!

154
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,570
Th-This is awful!

155
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:53,790
It's all right. There's no threat to her life.

156
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,250
Who the hell are you?!

157
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,790
Are you the one who did this to my daughter?

158
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,960
No, not him.

159
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,380
This boy kindly carried her in this far.

160
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,260
O-Oh yeah, that's right.

161
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,930
Her opponent was Spopovitch, huh?

162
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,010
Nice job. I'll give you an autograph later.

163
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,770
Right, thanks.

164
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:22,770
Well, you're in our way here, you can leave now.

165
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:23,940
Right.

166
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,860
G-Gohan-<i>kun...</i>

167
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,410
Get... get him for me...

168
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,630
Once I win this next match,
I'll meet him in the second round!

169
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,310
What are you saying, Videl?

170
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,150
That crazy kid doesn't have a chance!

171
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,030
I will be the one who takes out Spopovitch!

172
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,370
I-I-It can't be!

173
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,170
You two aren't together, are you?!

174
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,840
I-I won't allow it! Especially not
that aggravatingly weak looking boy!

175
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,840
I say it all the time, don't I?

176
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,340
You can't have a boyfriend
unless he's stronger than your Papa!

177
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,600
Silence.

178
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,980
Here are your <i>senzu.</i>

179
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,360
Thank you, Karin-<i>sama</i>!

180
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,780
Now then, you mustn't let
your defenses down, Goku.

181
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,870
I have a bad feeling about
what's about to happen.

182
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,040
Yeah.

183
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,370
So do I.

184
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,050
<i>What is this "bad feeling"</i>
<i>that Karin-sama also has?</i>

185
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:18,800
<i>Is there something extreme waiting</i>
<i>to happen at this Tenkaichi Tournament?</i>

186
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,820
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

187
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,410
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

188
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,970
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

189
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

190
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,110
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

191
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,490
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

192
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,320
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

193
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

194
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,960
<i>Even now?</i>

195
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,590
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

196
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,970
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

197
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:48,480
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

198
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:58,490
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

199
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,920
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

200
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,430
<i>Gohan, your friends are in the stands cheering,</i>

201
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,800
<i>and it looks like they've</i>
<i>seen through your disguise.</i>

202
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,140
<i>Gohan-kun, good luck!</i>

203
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,770
<i>You look better without the sunglasses!</i>

204
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,770
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

205
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,770
<i>"Exposed!! The Saiyaman is Son Gohan."</i>

206
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,320
<i>Oh, no. If the others find</i>
<i>out what my real power is,</i>

207
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,860
<i>I won't be able to go to school anymore.</i>

208
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,610
"Next time"
"Exposed!! The Saiyaman is Son Gohan"
