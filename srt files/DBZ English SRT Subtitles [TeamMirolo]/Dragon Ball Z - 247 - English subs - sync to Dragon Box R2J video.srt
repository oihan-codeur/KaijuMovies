N-Now that you mention it,
Babidi's <i>ki</i> has vanished.

49

I got the feeling he was
going to do so before too long.

50
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,000
He really has done it!

51
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:10,630
S-So that means that there's
no one left to order Boo around.

52
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,060
It could be that Majin Boo
will now stand down quietly...

53
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,600
Then, that means that peace
will return to Earth, right?!

It would be nice if that were so, but...

Yea! Yea! Oh boy, oh boy!!

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,770
Yea! Yea! Where should
I start demolishing now?

63
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,360

"Popular Super-star, Barry Karn"

like this kind of man. Okay!

76
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,500

77
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,380
Let's smooch!

78
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,720
No!! I won't!! I won't!! Absolutely not!!

79
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,560
You're a selfish woman!

80
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,560
You turn into a caramel!

81
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,570
Now then, it will be boring
until those strong guys come, so...

82
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:06,090
I'll play around by eliminating all Earthlings!

83
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,140
H-How awful!

84
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,320
So, we were too optimistic in our thinking.

85
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,860
Now that he's all by himself,
Majin Boo is enjoying destroying cities.

86
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,410
He's pretty nasty about that.

87
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:29,370
Damn! If that rat felt like it,

88
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,910
he could wipe out the whole Earth in
an instant, everything here included!

89
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,210
It'll be all right!

90
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,340
He ain't going to destroy the
whole Earth at once, I don't think.

91
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,050
When I told Boo that in two days,

92
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:44,550
someone even stronger than me was
going to fight him, he seemed happy.

93
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:48,090
For the next two days,
at least, you'll be okay here.

94
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:50,890
I feel sorry for the Earthlings
down in the lower realm, though.

95
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,020
Well, in any case, we'll return everything
back to normal with the Dragon Balls,

96
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,730
so everything will be fine!

97
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,480
Which means that no matter what,

98
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,480
we have to get those two to
master Fusion in two day's time.

99
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,570
That's what it means.

100
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,410
I have to teach them quick,
or the time I have left will be...

101
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,870
I ain't got more than an hour!

102
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,290
O-One hour?!

103
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,290
That can't be right! You should
have more time than that!

104
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,920
Can we learn this Fusion
technique in just an hour?

105
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,590
That Super Saiyan 3 thing I did earlier?

106
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,760
It's a technique I can
only use in the Other World.

107
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,430
Here in this world, where you have time,

108
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,350
it uses up too much energy,

109
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,730
and all at once, it gets me tired out.

110
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,320
Is that it? So that's why
you're so short of breath, Goku.

111
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,910
In that case, ask Dende to
have him replenish your energy!

112
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:54,370
No. This is something I have to
go back to the Other World for.

113
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,920
Your remaining time...

114
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,750
...is down to 30 minutes.

115
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,380
You better start getting
ready to go back, Goku.

116
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:12,800
Uranai O-Baba! Only 30 minutes?
Is that all I have left?!

117
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,850
That's right, unfortunately enough...

118
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,730
Damn! Get back here fast, Trunks!

119
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,260
Are you all right, Gohan-<i>san</i>?

120
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,300
Yes!

121
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,980
It is utterly unbelievable!

122
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,980
For him to be able to swing
around the same Z-sword...

123
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,360
...that generations of Kaioshin found
unmanageable in this short a time...!

124
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,690
It is indeed as I anticipated.

125
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,070
Knowing Gohan-<i>san</i>, he is certain
to be able to defeat Majin Boo.

126
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,760
Gohan-<i>san</i>, why don't you take
a short break for the time being?

127
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,340
You are doing very well!
Better than I had imagined!

128
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,390
No, I still have much to do!

129
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,320
<i>Father continued his training,</i>
<i>even in the Other World.</i>

130
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,730
<i>Even if just a little bit...</i>

131
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,650
<i>Even if just a little bit,</i>
<i>I have to become more like Father!</i>

132
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:41,870
<i>Majin Boo is still alive, after all!</i>

133
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,300
Goku, there's something
I want to ask now, while I can.

134
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,310
What's that?

135
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,930
With that Super Saiyan 3–
If you had gone all-out,

136
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,730
you could have defeated
Boo, couldn't you have?

137
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,860
How about it? Am I wrong?

138
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,480
Eh. I don't know.

139
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,700
When it comes to Majin Boo's
strength, everything's so unreal.

140
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,740
I think that beating him would
have probably been impossible.

141
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,290
Probably?

142
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,880
Being that it was you, why didn't
you try holding out until the end?

143
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,880
Does it have something to
do with that energy thing?

144
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,000
No...

145
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:41,930
I'm a person who ain't particularly
even supposed to be here.

146
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,930
I shouldn't be the one to do it.

147
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,350
This is a thing that living people
ought to do something to solve.

148
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,770
Even if I were to defeat him,

149
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,810
someone else outrageous
will appear at some time, right?

150
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,950
It's a dangerous risk to take...

151
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,990
but looking at those
two ultra-prodigy squirts,

152
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,250
I decided to try taking that risk.

153
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,830
You're betting the future of
Earth on Goten and Trunks?

154
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,670
Yeah. Doing it this way is more promising.

155
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,170
You really are something!

156
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,310
It's too bad about Gohan.

157
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,730
Say, when you go back to the
Other Side, tell him I send my regards.

158
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:39,860
I think the most regrettable thing
about him dying is that he can't see you.

159
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,370
Gohan adored you, after all...

160
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,660
Hey! Trunks has come back!

161
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,050
Welcome back, Trunks! Well done!

162
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,510
I'm back!

163
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:06,100
I brought it with me!
This, right? The Dragon Radar?

164
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,760
All right!

165
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,900
This is it! This is it! As long as we have this,

166
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,110
we can return the cities
back the way they were,

167
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,240
and bring everyone who died back to life!

168
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,240
Uncle, you're incredibly strong!
You might even be stronger than Papa!

169
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,080
That ain't so!

170
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,870
Not your dad...

171
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,710
Father, you said you were unconscious,
so we thought maybe you were weak!

172
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,140
Goten! Trunks! The Fusion
training continues now!

173
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,430
Right!

174
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,310
I only have a little bit of time left now.

175
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,320
Unless you guys are all fired up,
it really is the end of the Earth.

176
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,650
Understood?

177
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:01,610
–Yes, Sensei!
–Yes, Sensei!

178
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,200
What's this, you've gotten
considerably more submissive, huh?

179
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,120
Looks like Super Saiyan 3 has
served a purpose in this area, as well.

180
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,040
Okay, here goes!

181
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,210
Let's do over from where you
were matching your <i>ki</i> together.

182
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,920
–Right!
–Right!

183
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,100
He's here, he's here!

184
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,970
I have spotted Majin Boo,
altitude 3000 meters, at point SX-39.

185
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,180
He is casually flying southwest.

186
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,240
He's coming this way!

187
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,570
Looks like fun! Let's play, you!

188
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,790
It's okay now. We've gotten clean away...

189
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,920
That's kinda itchy!

190
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,190
H-Help!!

191
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,830
That wasn't very fun.

192
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,970
I-Incredible!

193
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,390
To think those two half-pints could raise
their <i>ki</i> from within themselves to this extent...!

194
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,680
Hang in there, Trunks!

195
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,190
All right!

196
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,240
That's about the same.

197
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,450
This is what it feels
like to fit your <i>ki</i> together.

198
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,160
Practice it well afterwards.

199
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,990
Are you okay, Goku? It looks
like this is pretty hard on you.

200
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,080
I'm all right. I'm all right!

201
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,580
It's only for a little bit longer.
This ain't anything!

202
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,840
<i>Does it use that much of his vitality to</i>
<i>become Super Saiyan 3 here in the lower realm?</i>

203
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,760
N-Now listen.

204
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,640
In order for you to achieve Fusion,
the real hard part starts now.

205
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,230
–Right!
–Right!

206
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,230
Once you've gotten your
<i>ki</i> to be exactly the same,

207
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,230
if the two of you can also perform the
Fusion Pose together exactly the same,

208
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,530
your Fusion will be complete!

209
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm going to show you the Pose,
so you two learn it well! Got that?

210
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,950
–Yes!
–Yes!

211
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,540
First, you two will stand with a
certain degree of space between you.

212
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,550
Then, do this! Be careful
about the angle of your arms!

213
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:13,010
"Fu–" As you switch your arms,
you move towards each other.

214
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,010
At this time, you move
your feet three steps' worth.

215
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,140
"–sion!"

216
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,020
Carefully watch the angle of your legs!

217
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,020
"Ha!!"

218
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,570
Then you put your fingers together like this!

219
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,400
Again, carefully watch the angle of your legs!

220
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,240
What do we do?! That looks awful!

221
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,220
Oh boy, oh boy! Oh boy, oh boy!

222
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,640
<i>Without anyone to control him,</i>
<i>he's become even more violent!</i>

223
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,980
<i>Boo goes on a rampage!</i>

224
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,070
Okay, you guys try it now!

225
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,230
–Right!
–Right!

226
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:12,610
<i>Hurry, Goku! There isn't any time!</i>

227
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:19,330
<i>Initiate Trunks and Goten to the ways</i>
<i>of this new finishing technique, Fusion!</i>

228
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,890
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

229
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,430
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

230
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:56,030
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

231
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,120
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

232
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,130
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

233
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,510
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

234
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,390
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

235
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:27,440
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

236
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,980
<i>Even now?</i>

237
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:36,610
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

238
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,030
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

239
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:48,500
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

240
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:58,550
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

241
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,360
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

242
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,360
<i>I'm just about out of time.</i>

243
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,950
<i>Trunks, Goten, practice</i>
<i>that Fusion good and hard.</i>

244
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,910
<i>You're gonna be the</i>
<i>ones who defeat Majin Boo.</i>

245
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,080
<i>Say, they said they were training,</i>
<i>but is this dance training?</i>

246
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,120
<i>Are they really going to be</i>
<i>able to defeat Majin Boo like that?</i>

247
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,540
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

248
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:35,050
<i>"See You Later, Everybody!!</i>
<i>Goku Returns to the Other World."</i>

249
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,840
<i>We've got to work hard,</i>
<i>to make up for Father leaving.</i>

250
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,630
"Next time"
"See You Later, Everybody!!
Goku Returns to the Other World"
