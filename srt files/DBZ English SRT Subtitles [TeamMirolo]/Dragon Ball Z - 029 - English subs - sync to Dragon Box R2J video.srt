00:03:43,695 --> 00:03:45,255

W-What?!

How?! How does Kakarrot have this much power?!

32
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:02,505
What?!

33
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:07,105

35
00:05:33,675 --> 00:05:37,605
Awesome! You really are awesome, Goku!

36
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:38,835
Yeah!

37
00:05:52,425 --> 00:06:00,055
Dammit! Dammit!

38
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:06,225
Dammit!

39
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:11,635
I see... Impressive...
You really are extremely tough, huh?

40
00:06:11,675 --> 00:06:14,635
I am an elite warrior
from a distinguished family!

41
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:18,645
I'm not about to be looked down
upon by a lower-class warrior like you!

42
00:06:18,685 --> 00:06:21,845
You'll pay for this! I'll kill you!

43
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:25,415
You miserable fool! Cool that head of yours!

44
00:06:25,455 --> 00:06:27,415
If you'll compose yourself and think about it,

45
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:30,655
you'll find he's not the kind of
opponent that you can't take, Nappa!

46
00:06:30,695 --> 00:06:32,455
Calm down!

47
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,405
You're right!

48
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:50,275
Thanks to you, my eyes have been opened.

49
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:57,945
<i>That simple-celled fool! At this</i>
<i>rate, it looks like I will have to step in.</i>

50
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:04,225
It's true, I was pretty upset. Now it's
time to show you what I'm really made of.

51
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:07,425
Are you ready for this, Kakarrot?!

52
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:11,625
That's more like it. I can't wait!

53
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,065
Talk tough, will you?

54
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:19,635
<i>He's not just talking tough. He's got</i>
<i>assurance and absolute confidence in himself.</i>

55
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,385
G-Goku...

56
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,425
Father...

57
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:57,405
Son<i>-kun</i>, pound that guy into a pulpy mass!

58
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:58,885
H-Hey!

59
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,015
Hey! Don't be so rough with this!

60
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:12,185
Who cares if a crystal ball or two gets broken?!

61
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,195
It's an important tool of my trade!

62
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:19,625
With Kami<i>-sama</i> dead, and us not knowing
whether the Earth will be destroyed or not,

63
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,035
you can just stuff your trade!

64
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,435
How dare you say that!

65
00:08:23,475 --> 00:08:25,835
Now see here!

66
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:29,275
Would you two quit it?!

67
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:30,645
It doesn't matter, does it?

68
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:35,845
Yeah! While you two are at it
there, Goku could be getting done in.

69
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:39,855
Rubbish! Son<i>-kun</i> is obviously doing all right!

70
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:44,455
You think he's going to lose
to those guys?! No way! No way!

71
00:08:44,495 --> 00:08:46,455
Don't hit my crystal ball!

72
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:51,125
Hey, shut up, already! Give that here!

73
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:54,335
A little brother does not
take his older sister's things!

74
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,455
I see you!

75
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:13,585
Whoo! This is a lot better, ain't it?

76
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:17,585
This is a lot better, huh?

77
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:21,755
I'm going to put a stop to that
irritatingly smart mouth of yours!

78
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:24,025
You're finished now!

79
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:52,315
What kind of guy is this?!
He countered at that close range!

80
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:08,995
That would have been
trouble if I'd taken that one head-on.

81
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:16,175
I-Impossible! That was–that was my
greatest technique, and you brushed it aside!

82
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:18,545
You really are one tough bastard.

83
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:21,345
You should have taken at least
a little damage from my Kamehame<i>-Ha.</i>

84
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:27,185
–We ain't getting anywhere like this.
–Enough! Get down here, Nappa!

85
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:30,785
You're getting us nowhere!
I'll take care of him for you.

86
00:11:30,825 --> 00:11:33,185
What?!

87
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:35,295
You're pathetic!

88
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:40,735
To think that I would have to trouble
myself to take action against Kakarrot there.

89
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:47,735
He's finally coming forward, huh?
Even that big guy is scared of him.

90
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,875
Father...

91
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:36,585
D-Dammit...

92
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:40,925
T-To think that I should have
to yield your execution to Vegeta...

93
00:12:40,965 --> 00:12:48,265
But brace yourself! Your life will
only last for a moment against Vegeta!

94
00:12:48,305 --> 00:12:53,875
He is a warrior gifted enough to take
upon him the name of Planet Vegeta, after all.

95
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:58,375
Since he ordered me to,
I'll leave you to Vegeta.

96
00:12:58,415 --> 00:13:01,615
But I won't be content to withdraw like this.

97
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,365
Oh, no! He's going after those two!

98
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:23,465
It's no use! I won't make it in time!

99
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:35,345
<i>Kaio-ken!</i>

100
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:36,615
What?!

101
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,775
What just happened?

102
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:04,175
Goku! How did you–?

103
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:12,985
Dammit!

104
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:21,725
I doubt he'll be able to fight anymore.

105
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:25,595
Take him, and disappear from
the face of the earth right now!

106
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:32,235
<i>What was that just now?! For an instant,</i>
<i>his speed and power suddenly increased!</i>

107
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,345
G-Goku, how did you do that?

108
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:44,345
Was that a technique you
learned from that Kaio person?

109
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:47,785
Yeah. It's called <i>Kaio-ken.</i>

110
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:53,425
By controlling all of the energy within
your body, you can momentarily amplify it.

111
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:59,165
If you do it right, your speed, power,

112
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:02,795
destructive and defensive
forces all increase many times over.

113
00:15:08,945 --> 00:15:10,345
T-That's awesome!

114
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:12,345
Even after getting that much stronger,

115
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:14,745
you can become many times stronger than <i>that</i>?!

116
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,385
Yeah.

117
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,755
What are those guys talking about?

118
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:26,925
Goku, that was mean of you!
This is no time to be playing around.

119
00:15:26,965 --> 00:15:32,365
If you have something like that up
your sleeve, then use it right at the start!

120
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:34,935
Sorry, but I can't do that.

121
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:40,465
If I don't restrain my <i>ki</i> just right while
I'm controlling it, I could wreck myself.

122
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:44,145
In short...

123
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:48,945
You have done well to
master the <i>Kaio-ken</i> technique,

124
00:15:48,985 --> 00:15:53,815
which even I could not handle,
to this degree. However,

125
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,755
I must stress once again that you must
not overuse <i>Kaio-ken</i> at your current level.

126
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:03,925
If you mishandle your control,
you will end up ruining your body.

127
00:16:03,965 --> 00:16:06,925
Do your best to limit yourself to 2x power.

128
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:09,735
Remember, using <i>Kaio-ken</i> any higher than that

129
00:16:09,775 --> 00:16:12,465
will place too great a burden upon your body.

130
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:15,775
In other words, your body won't
be able to keep up with the <i>Kaio-ken,</i>

131
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:18,785
and it will bite back
for what you're doing to it.

132
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,345
Understood clearly.

133
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:24,785
–...and that's the story.
–I-Is that right?

134
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:32,565
V-Vegeta... h-help me...

135
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:41,165
T-Thanks...

136
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,895
Not at all.

137
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:59,145
W-What are you doing, Vegeta?! Vegeta!

138
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,385
I don't have any use
for Saiyans that can't move!

139
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:16,735
W-What a <i>ki</i>!

140
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,905
F-Father!

141
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:24,345
W-What's going on?!

142
00:17:24,385 --> 00:17:26,405
Die!

143
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:44,805
V-Vegeta!

144
00:18:33,985 --> 00:18:40,285
W-What a beast! He even killed his own man!

145
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:58,935
Gohan... Kuririn...

146
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:02,965
Both of you, go back to Kame House right now.

147
00:19:15,395 --> 00:19:17,585
R-Right...

148
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:20,955
Gohan, you heard him. Let's go, now.

149
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:22,925
B-But...

150
00:19:22,965 --> 00:19:28,295
Gohan, he's just too terrible.
We won't do any good being here.

151
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:34,935
On the contrary, our being here will
distract Goku, and we'll just be in his way!

152
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:37,905
Really, Father?

153
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:43,715
Sorry, yeah. His strength appears
to be even greater than I thought.

154
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,285
O-Okay, I understand.

155
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:55,125
Oh yeah, Goku, as long as you're at it,
could you fight in some other place?

156
00:19:55,165 --> 00:19:58,525
It would be wrong to mess up everyone's bodies,

157
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:01,365
in case they ever come back to life.

158
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:05,905
They ever come back to life? With
Piccolo dead, Kami<i>-sama</i> is dead, too.

159
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:09,575
The Dragon Balls have disappeared forever.

160
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:18,245
I hate to say it, but nobody
is ever coming back to life again.

161
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:21,255
I know that...

162
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:24,745
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, you don't think–?

163
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,255
What?

164
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:35,265
I'll go into the details later.
T-That is, if you're able to beat him, Goku.

165
00:20:35,305 --> 00:20:37,865
<i>I f</i> I can beat him, huh?

166
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:41,935
Right. In any case, I have to beat him.

167
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:51,185
What are you doing? What happened
to all that energy you had before?

168
00:20:51,225 --> 00:20:54,585
Did you get scared, and now you're
discussing how you're going to run away?

169
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:59,355
Now then, to change
locations and give it my best, I guess.

170
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:01,555
Just let me take care of this.

171
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:08,735
Goku, I feel bad about
always leaving our fate up to you.

172
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:11,575
Don't you dare die now, my friend.

173
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,775
Right.

174
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,715
Father...

175
00:21:22,755 --> 00:21:25,285
Gohan...

176
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:30,415
Once your daddy comes back
alive, let's go fishing again, okay?

177
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:43,375
Okay.

178
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:54,985
Looks like you know that
it won't do any good to run.

179
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,945
We're going to change
the location of our battle.

180
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:04,185
Suit yourself. It will all end up the same.

181
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,795
Father...

182
00:22:14,805 --> 00:22:19,935
<i>Vegeta... Has there ever</i>
<i>been a foe this powerful before?</i>

183
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:22,705
<i>The curtain now rises on a fierce deathbattle,</i>

184
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:26,975
<i>with the fate of the</i>
<i>Earth and our friends at stake.</i>

185
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,195
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

186
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:53,065
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

187
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,445
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

188
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:03,945
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

189
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:10,415
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

190
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:14,525
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

191
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:18,025
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

192
00:23:18,065 --> 00:23:20,665
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

193
00:23:22,405 --> 00:23:28,175
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

194
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:32,275
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

195
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:34,115
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

196
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:38,145
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

197
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:43,815
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

198
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,985
<i>So sorry.</i>

199
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:51,125
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

200
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:59,105
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

201
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,945
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

202
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:14,155
<i>Looks like it's finally</i>
<i>time for us to fight, huh?</i>

203
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:17,155
<i>You should be thrilled.</i>
<i>A lower-class warrior such as yourself</i>

204
00:24:17,195 --> 00:24:20,285
<i>is about to be toyed around</i>
<i>with by a super-elite, after all.</i>

205
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:25,395
<i>W-What a ki! It's as if</i>
<i>the whole earth is shaking!</i>

206
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:27,295
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

207
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:31,505
<i>"A Hot, Unbounded Battle!</i>
<i>Goku vs. Vegeta."</i>

208
00:24:31,545 --> 00:24:33,545
<i>Father won't be beaten!</i>

209
00:24:33,585 --> 00:24:36,845
"Next time"
"A Hot, Unbounded Battle!
Goku vs. Vegeta"
