<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,065
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:41,695
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,705
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,645

<i>The Tenkaichi Tournament</i>
<i>had reached its closing act,</i>

24
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:57,685
<i>and the only ones who remained</i>
<i>were No. 18 and Mister Satan.</i>

25
00:01:57,725 --> 00:01:59,735
<i>It was thought to be</i>
<i>an easy victory for No. 18,</i>

26
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:02,275
<i>but with her eye on the prize money,</i>

27
00:02:02,315 --> 00:02:08,235
<i>No. 18 negotiated a deal with Mister</i>
<i>Satan, and sold her victory to him.</i>

28
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:11,705
I will admit that you have considerable skill.

29
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:14,285
However, your opponent is too much for you!

30
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:18,995
You've fought well, but
after all, I am the champion!

31
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:28,595
Take this! Satan Miracle Special
Ultra Super Megaton Punch!!

32
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:36,805
<i>The curtain has dropped</i>

34

<i>Elsewhere, as Goku and the</i>

36
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:58,745
<i>Dabura, King of the Demon Realm</i>
<i>of Darkness, stands in their way.</i>

37
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:04,165
<i>Dabura has put up a good fight, and</i>
<i>Gohan at length opened up his full power.</i>

40
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:32,545
What?!

41
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:08,795
Aah, Dabura!

42
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:57,845
You get serious! At this degree,
we can't even call it a fight!

43
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:03,385
I-Incredible!

44
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,495
Very well...

45
00:07:51,835 --> 00:07:53,795
The real me is over here!

46
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:55,755
Die!!

47
00:07:56,835 --> 00:07:58,925
Ah, damn!

48
00:08:14,855 --> 00:08:17,275
That's one down...

49
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:29,955
<i>Oh, ow, ow! I dropped my guard!</i>

50
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:39,045
<i>He's lying in wait for me, huh?</i>

51
00:09:29,425 --> 00:09:31,425
There you are!

52
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,435
Gohan!

53
00:09:57,245 --> 00:10:00,455
Even powered up, that's
still the best you've got, is it?

54
00:10:05,425 --> 00:10:08,215
Just what you'd expect from the
King of the Demon Realm of Darkness.

55
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:12,265
He really is on a different
level from Puipui or Yakon.

56
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:22,065
Dammit! I got careless there,
but it won't happen this time!

57
00:10:38,835 --> 00:10:43,215
No, no, Gohan! You can't keep
up that monotonous style of attack!

58
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:45,425
He'll read your next move!

59
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:52,265
It's no use. He's completely
forgotten his intuition for fighting.

60
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:04,105
We're not done yet!

61
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:18,205
Why, that rotten... Here I come!

62
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:23,295
Look out! You'll be turned to stone!

63
00:11:46,235 --> 00:11:49,315
That was close, that was close!

64
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:22,645
Satan! Satan! Satan!

65
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:38,575
"Martial"

66
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,465
Goten!

67
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,965
Trunks!

68
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:54,595
Goten! Goten!

69
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:56,675
Ah, Mommy!

70
00:13:02,845 --> 00:13:04,565
Have you been a good girl?

71
00:13:04,605 --> 00:13:05,975
Yeah!

72
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:10,735
No. 18, what on Earth happened?
How could you lose to a guy like that?

73
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,485
Are you malfunctioning somewhere?

74
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,585
W-What's with that attitude?!

75
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:27,045
And here someone's going out
of their way to worry about her!

76
00:13:39,675 --> 00:13:41,015
Hey, hey!

77
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,765
What is it, Goten?

78
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:45,055
What's a Majin?

79
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:52,645
Ah, come on!

80
00:13:54,235 --> 00:13:57,985
You don't even know that, yet you're
in such a fuss over wanting to see one?

81
00:13:58,025 --> 00:14:02,995
Yeah! So, you know then, Trunks-<i>kun</i>?

82
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:07,995
Well, I... of course! A Majin is...

83
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:10,665
Yeah? Yeah?

84
00:14:12,045 --> 00:14:14,545
A Majin is...

85
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,595
Yeah? Yeah?

86
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:22,555
It's... see...

87
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,595
What's a Majin?

88
00:14:29,605 --> 00:14:35,605
Ah, well, that is... anyhow...

89
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:41,365
It's this utterly incredible guy!

90
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:44,035
You'll be so surprised when you see him, Goten!

91
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:47,415
Wow! I'm sure looking forward to that!

92
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,035
Probably...

93
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:53,375
Yeah, let's hurry, Goten!

94
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:55,425
Y-Yeah!

95
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:52,725
Dabura's a lot stronger
than we thought, ain't he?

96
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:55,945
Hmph! Even so, he's not an
opponent that can't be beaten!

97
00:15:55,985 --> 00:16:01,945
He's pathetic! He was
stronger when he was just a kid!

98
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:04,075
What are we going to do with him?

99
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:07,535
Gohan really has been
skipping out on his training, huh?!

100
00:16:08,705 --> 00:16:10,825
This is getting on my nerves.

101
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,625
Where are you looking?

102
00:16:25,005 --> 00:16:28,345
–You're mine!
–What?!

103
00:16:28,385 --> 00:16:30,845
Has he really done it this time?

104
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:57,875
Dammit, what are you doing, Dabura?

105
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:02,885
You've got to do more
and more, greater damage!

106
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:08,015
O-Once Majin Boo returns,
those guys won't matter!

107
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:54,975
Gohan...!

108
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,615
What?!

109
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:17,305
Dammit, this is irritating!

110
00:19:17,345 --> 00:19:20,355
All right, I'm going to put an end to this!

111
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:23,645
No you don't, Vegeta! Let him do this!

112
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:26,315
It's not exactly like he's
completely losing there!

113
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:29,525
All this playing around isn't important!

114
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:36,875
I want to put and end to this so
I can hurry and settle my score with you!

115
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:38,875
That's the whole reason
I went to all the trouble

116
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:41,875
of going to that ridiculous tournament!

117
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,875
If it doesn't look like he's
going to make any more progress,

118
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:47,085
I'll end this in an instant!

119
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:59,895
Babidi-<i>sama</i>, please return us
to the spaceship immediately!

120
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,725
I have made quite a grand discovery!

121
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,145
Grand discovery?

122
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:08,695
It will mean the revival of Majin Boo...

123
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:12,695
W-What?! Is this true, Dabura?

124
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:14,075
Quite possibly.

125
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:15,705
Just bring you back, right?

126
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:17,705
Yes.

127
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:19,365
Papparapa!

128
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:27,085
W-What?!

129
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,795
Huh? We're back!

130
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,965
W-What's this?

131
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:39,265
H-Hey! Are you running away from me?

132
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:46,355
Run away? Indeed not. I do not
need to bother myself with fighting.

133
00:20:46,395 --> 00:20:51,565
I've found just the right warrior for all of you.

134
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:01,625
Wait!

135
00:21:01,665 --> 00:21:05,455
<i>Just the right warrior? What does he mean?</i>

136
00:21:08,295 --> 00:21:12,085
What is the meaning of this, Dabura?

137
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:15,345
There really is a great discovery, isn't there?

138
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,725
Yes.

139
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:22,935
I trust you didn't just get frightened

140
00:21:22,975 --> 00:21:29,315
by those humans and come
running back here, right?

141
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:34,275
Dabura, King of the Demon
Realm, is afraid of nothing.

142
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:40,285
Well then, that's fine. So then,
hurry and tell me this great discovery!

143
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:45,125
There is one among them that has a
very strong wickedness within his heart.

144
00:21:45,165 --> 00:21:46,495
With that degree of evil in his heart,

145
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:48,665
we can sufficiently draw him over to our side.

146
00:21:48,705 --> 00:21:51,925
I-I get it! We don't even have to fight them,

147
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:55,675
we can turn them on each
other and just take in their energy!

148
00:21:55,715 --> 00:21:58,675
If we do that...

149
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:01,555
Majin Boo will be revived!

150
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:08,355
Bravo! Bravo, Dabura!

151
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:22,115
<i>Dabura has discovered</i>
<i>the evil in Vegeta's heart.</i>

152
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:26,745
<i>A critical clash between Saiyans is approaching!</i>

153
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:38,465
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

154
00:22:40,215 --> 00:22:45,055
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

155
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:55,615
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

156
00:22:55,655 --> 00:23:01,745
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

157
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:08,745
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

158
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:14,125
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

159
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:17,965
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:27,055
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

161
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:28,605
<i>Even now?</i>

162
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:36,235
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

163
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:41,655
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

164
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:48,125
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

165
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:58,175
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

166
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:15,065
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

167
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:18,605
<i>Damn that Babidi!</i>
<i>He's planning to make Vegeta fight us</i>

168
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:20,905
<i>at the Tenkaichi Tournament!</i>

169
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:22,945
<i>Just what has come over you, Vegeta?!</i>

170
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:24,695
<i>Blasting the stadium, with everyone in it–</i>

171
00:24:24,735 --> 00:24:26,785
<i>this is some kind of mistake, right?</i>

172
00:24:26,825 --> 00:24:28,995
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

173
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:32,875
<i>"Vegeta, Prince of Destruction, Revived!!</i>
<i>Intrusion at the Tournament."</i>

174
00:24:32,915 --> 00:24:36,915
<i>No, Vegeta-san! Don't let</i>
<i>those guys control you!</i>

175
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,255
"Next time"
"Vegeta, Prince of Destruction, Revived!!
Intrusion at the Tournament"
