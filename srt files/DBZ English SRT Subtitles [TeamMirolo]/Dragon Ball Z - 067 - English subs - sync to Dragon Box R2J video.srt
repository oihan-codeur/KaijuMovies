<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:12,335
<i>Goku, whom everyone had</i>
<i>been waiting for, had finally come.</i>

17
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:32,645
His battle power is like that of a trash bug.

18
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:50,575
You can't beat me. I can
tell without even fighting you.

19
00:03:50,615 --> 00:03:53,605
D-Don't tell me!

20
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:00,425
I'm going to send all four
of you into the next world!

21
00:04:01,585 --> 00:04:03,985
<i>ReaCoom...</i>

22
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:06,385
<i>...Ultra...</i>

<i>...Attack!!</i>

26
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:39,425
<i>Amazingly, he defeated</i>
<i>ReaCoom with just one blow!</i>

27
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:45,625
I-Is he a Super Saiyan?!

28
00:04:50,575 --> 00:04:58,105
<i>"Lightning Balls of Red and Blue!</i>
<i>Jheese and Butta Attack Goku."</i>

29
00:05:44,455 --> 00:05:46,185
What are you guys going to do?!

30
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:49,495
Are you going to go back
to your own planet now?!

31
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:55,235
Or would you rather be
knocked flat, like this guy?!

32
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:03,635
Did you hear that, Butta?

33
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:08,345
That manly-man is spouting that drivel again.

34
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:11,815
Yeah, he seems to be
under the mistaken impression

35
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:13,945
that he defeated ReaCoom by force.

36
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:16,045
It was just a strange coincidence,

37
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:20,355
overlapping with ReaCoom
letting his guard down. Right?

38
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:23,895
Yeah, of course it was just by chance.

39
00:06:23,935 --> 00:06:27,965
His battle power rating barely changed at all.

40
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:32,795
W-What's going on with
Goku being so self-possessed?

41
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:35,505
F-Father...

42
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:58,555
The Ginyu Special Corps' Red Magma...

43
00:07:03,775 --> 00:07:05,895
Jheese!

44
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,375
And the Blue Hurricane...

45
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,745
Butta!

46
00:07:13,945 --> 00:07:16,885
So you ain't leaving, then?

47
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,785
Kakarrot has them beat.

48
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,355
Here we go!

49
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,955
Yeah!

50
00:08:10,935 --> 00:08:12,895
This is getting boring!

51
00:08:12,935 --> 00:08:15,305
He's not playing with us at all, is he?

52
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:18,905
Are you sure he's not just too scared to move?

53
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:22,975
Well, well, it turns out he's
just a big idiot, full of hot air!

54
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:31,985
I-It must be that their speed
is so great that Goku can't move.

55
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,755
Hey, Jheese!

56
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,995
You're playing around too much!

57
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:44,805
What about you? You could
stand to take a shot at him yourself!

58
00:08:58,315 --> 00:09:00,215
Gohan, get out of the way!

59
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,925
I-It can't be!

60
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:24,705
He's a sassy bastard!
We're the Ginyu Special Corps!

61
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:30,375
You can't go on mocking us forever–

62
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,965
W-Why, you!

63
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:53,065
Whatever you say,

64
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:56,545
but are you sure you guys ain't
leaving yourselves open too much?

65
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:00,945
What did you say?!

66
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:09,715
W–

67
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:11,315
Why, you!

68
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:39,915
W-What was that?!

69
00:10:40,925 --> 00:10:43,825
What the hell did you just do?!

70
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:52,825
A <i>kiai</i> shout... He sent them
flying with just a <i>kiai</i> shout.

71
00:11:05,645 --> 00:11:08,645
I have finally gotten all
seven Dragon Balls together.

72
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:13,075
Now I will be able to obtain eternal life.

73
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:16,655
How silly of me.

74
00:11:16,695 --> 00:11:21,785
Who would have thought that I would
need a passcode to have my wish granted?

75
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:28,095
Be that as it may, we will see
whether or not the surviving Namekians...

76
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:32,795
...will be accommodating enough
to tell me what the passcode is.

77
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:23,015
Grand Elder<i>-sama...</i>

78
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,445
Wrong!

79
00:12:48,785 --> 00:12:52,115
How many times do I have to tell you?! Huh?!

80
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:56,085
Your right leg goes like this!

81
00:12:56,425 --> 00:12:59,715
Remember, I'm thinking
up an ultra fighting pose

82
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:01,925
that's far cooler than
anything else up until now.

83
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:05,925
Freeza<i>-sama</i> will be seeing this,
so be dependable practice dummies.

84
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:11,365
I know! If you can pull
this off well, I'll give you this.

85
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:14,365
I'm so nice, aren't I?

86
00:13:14,405 --> 00:13:16,775
All right, let's go!

87
00:13:17,975 --> 00:13:19,775
R-ReaCoom!

88
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,375
B-Butta!

89
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:22,775
J-Jheese!

90
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,375
G-Ghurd!

91
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:25,945
Ginyu!

92
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:30,825
Together we are the Ginyu Special Corps!

93
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:45,595
"Smack"

94
00:13:51,945 --> 00:13:54,435
Don't touch the Dragon Balls!

95
00:13:58,355 --> 00:14:03,755
Those are the precious Dragon Balls
that Freeza<i>-sama</i> has entrusted to me.

96
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:05,755
Why did you touch them?!

97
00:14:05,795 --> 00:14:07,325
W-Well... I, uh...

98
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:10,195
Why?!

99
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:14,805
I see.

100
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:23,365
If you want to touch them so
badly, then maybe I'll let you.

101
00:14:35,385 --> 00:14:38,055
Go on, try to touch them.

102
00:14:41,025 --> 00:14:43,455
If you are able to touch
them, even a little bit,

103
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:48,025
I will give you all two caramels each.

104
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:09,085
Come on, come on,
what's the matter with you?!

105
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,385
You won't become stronger warriors like this,

106
00:15:10,425 --> 00:15:13,955
no matter how long you work at it!

107
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:41,745
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>, do you get the feeling
those two aren't as strong as we thought?

108
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:43,915
They can't lay a hand on Father.

109
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:47,145
T-That can't be right.

110
00:17:14,185 --> 00:17:17,115
They have about the same
amount of <i>ki</i> as ReaCoom,

111
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:21,285
and not even Vegeta
could do anything against him.

112
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:25,155
Maybe Goku is just so
overly strong that those guys

113
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:27,655
don't look all that tough compared to him.

114
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:32,895
I'm not so sure. Father's <i>ki</i> seems
so much more smaller than theirs.

115
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:37,735
W-What's going on here?!

116
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:42,305
His battle power is only
5000, no question about it!

117
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:45,505
But my attacks aren't even grazing him.

118
00:17:45,545 --> 00:17:49,545
Kakarrot is sharply raising his
battle power for the briefest instant,

119
00:17:49,585 --> 00:17:52,915
right when they attack.

120
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:57,855
Probably to avoid consuming
any unnecessary energy.

121
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:06,295
It's such a brief moment that the
Scouters probably can't pick it up.

122
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,265
H-He has an incredible battle power.

123
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:12,705
How does he have that kind of power?

124
00:18:14,645 --> 00:18:16,405
This is pissing me off!

125
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:20,345
I'm not about to let that
little fart make a fool of me!

126
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:21,905
Hey, Jheese!

127
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:25,515
Let's do the Purple Comet Crush!

128
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:30,355
The Purple Comet Crush, huh?
That sounds good!

129
00:18:30,395 --> 00:18:32,555
All right, let's do it, Butta!

130
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,425
Yeah!

131
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,485
What?! What's going on?!

132
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:16,465
Geez!

133
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:22,305
What could they all be doing,
abandoning a fragile lady here like this?!

134
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:26,475
That goes for Son<i>-kun</i>, too! Just saying
he fell behind schedule isn't good enough!

135
00:19:26,515 --> 00:19:31,315
As soon as he gets here, I'll have
to have him take me straight home.

136
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:33,475
If I have to stay here too long,

137
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:37,545
my skin will be damaged,
and my good looks will be ruined!

138
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:46,165
I want to go home to Earth.

139
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:14,885
What in the world is this?!

140
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,565
That bastard!

141
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:30,575
Jheese!

142
00:20:31,415 --> 00:20:34,305
Huh? What, Butta?

143
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,345
At this point, you should
launch your <i>Crusher Ball.</i>

144
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:42,345
Knowing his speed, he'll
probably dodge it and run away.

145
00:20:42,385 --> 00:20:43,915
What are you going to do?

146
00:20:43,955 --> 00:20:47,185
Isn't it obvious? I'm going to smash him

147
00:20:47,225 --> 00:20:49,225
from the back as he's
frantically getting out of the way.

148
00:20:49,265 --> 00:20:53,825
However fast he might be,
I'm still the fastest in the universe.

149
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:55,825
All right.

150
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:59,235
Although, why should we
have to, against that scum?

151
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,405
Dammit!

152
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:06,235
<i>Crusher...</i>

153
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,745
<i>...Ball!!</i>

154
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:16,945
Come on, now...

155
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,125
What's wrong?! Why isn't he dodging it?!

156
00:21:27,335 --> 00:21:29,235
He deflected it!

157
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,605
D-Damn it!

158
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,785
Huh?

159
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:57,295
Dammit, where did he go?!

160
00:22:00,335 --> 00:22:02,495
Behind you, Butta!

161
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:16,475
Yo.

162
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:21,315
<i>Goku's power far exceeds</i>
<i>that of the Ginyu Special Corps.</i>

163
00:22:21,355 --> 00:22:28,555
<i>Has Goku become that legendary</i>
<i>warrior, a Super Saiyan, after all?</i>

164
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:48,505
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

165
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:54,345
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

166
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:56,725
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

167
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:05,225
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

168
00:23:07,535 --> 00:23:11,735
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

169
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:15,835
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

170
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:19,335
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

171
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,975
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

172
00:23:23,715 --> 00:23:29,485
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

173
00:23:31,725 --> 00:23:33,585
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

174
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,385
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

175
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:39,425
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

176
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:45,095
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

177
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:47,265
<i>So sorry.</i>

178
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:52,405
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

179
00:23:55,145 --> 00:24:00,415
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

180
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,395
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

181
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:16,695
<i>I think I've become a lot stronger.</i>

182
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:19,495
<i>Even so, you say that there's no</i>
<i>way I can defeat this Freeza guy?</i>

183
00:24:19,535 --> 00:24:22,905
<i>This could be a fight more</i>
<i>interesting than any I've had before.</i>

184
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:25,505
<i>I never thought the time would</i>
<i>ever come when I, Ginyu-sama,</i>

185
00:24:25,545 --> 00:24:28,275
<i>would get to display my true level of power.</i>

186
00:24:28,315 --> 00:24:30,075
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

187
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:33,945
<i>"At Last, a Direct Confrontation!!</i>
<i>Captain Ginyu Takes the Field."</i>

188
00:24:33,985 --> 00:24:35,785
<i>Father is the best in the universe!</i>

189
00:24:35,825 --> 00:24:38,125
"Next time"
"At Last, a Direct Confrontation!!
Captain Ginyu Takes the Field"
