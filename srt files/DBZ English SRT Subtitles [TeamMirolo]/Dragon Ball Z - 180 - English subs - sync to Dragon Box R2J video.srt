<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,450
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:29,710
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:36,460
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,010
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:51,900
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,400
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:04,410
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,870
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:14,000
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,380
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:26,350
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,890
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:36,770
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,730
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,750
This is a magnificent fight!

17
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,840
I would hate to let it end
due to an out-of-bounds defeat.

18
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:06,430
Let's remove the out-of-bounds
defeat from the rules.

19
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,930
It doesn't hold any meaning for us.

20
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,610
<i>With the ring blown away,</i>

21
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,860
<i>the ferocious mortal combat</i>
<i>between Son Goku and Cell continued.</i>

22
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,470
<i>Ka... me...</i>

23
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,280
You can't shoot a
<i>Kamehame-Ha</i> from that position!

24
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,030
If you did, it would be a disaster for the Earth!

25
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,700
<i>ha... me...</i>

26
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,870
H-Hey...!

27
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,130
Holy–!

28
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,300
<i>Ha</i>!!

29
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,930
<i>At last, Goku's full power</i>
<i>Kamehame-Ha exploded forth!</i>

30
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,600
<i>"A Conclusion to the Deathmatch!!</i>
<i>Goku's Declaration of Surrender!?"</i>

31
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,930
G-Goku...!

32
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,070
I-Incredible... What could have happened?

33
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,090
H-He got him! He got him! So that's it!

34
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,390
There was always his Instantaneous Movement!

35
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,270
Hey, he got him! Goku has finally won!

36
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:12,620
W-What's wrong, guys? Aren't you happy?

37
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,160
Mister Satan, it looks
like he has taken care of Cell.

38
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,500
Mister Satan!

39
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,920
W-Well, he did all right, huh?
S-Still, it's too bad.

40
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,630
I wanted to be the one who defeated him!

41
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,430
It really is too bad, Mister Satan, since
now you can't display your magnificent,

42
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,980
graceful, powerful moves to the whole world.

43
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,150
–Right?
–Yes!

44
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,690
P-People of the world!
It is truly disappointing

45
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,110
that before Mister Satan could
make his marvelous reappearance,

46
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,370
this unnamed young man has defeated Cell.

47
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,170
S-So is it over now?

48
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,720
That was kind of disappointing, huh?

49
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,180
Say, Mama, Mister Satan
isn't appearing any more?

50
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,350
It looks that way.

51
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,770
<i>What does this mean?</i>

52
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,900
<i>Even in this condition, he still</i>
<i>has a good deal of ki remaining...</i>

53
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,990
Be careful, Goku!

54
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,700
Cell will probably recover!

55
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,620
What?!

56
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,380
W-W-What?!

57
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:58,390
Cell's lower half has stood up!

58
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,130
He's come back to life!
Cell has come back to life!

59
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,750
Is this a trick as well, Mister Satan?

60
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,130
O-O-Of course it's a trick!

61
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,140
Come to think of it, you
can regenerate yourself, huh?

62
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,480
That's correct. Just like Piccolo.

63
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,610
That dirty bastard!

64
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,110
Sheesh, I thought I had won fairly easily.

65
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,780
But even you had to have lost
quite a bit of your <i>ki</i> over this.

66
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,490
That goes for both of us.

67
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,160
You're breathing quite a bit harder yourself.

68
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,410
Okay then, let's keep going.

69
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,290
I'll warn you now, though,
I won't fall for the same trick twice.

70
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,300
Make sure you don't waste
your strength on futile attacks

71
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,130
that would make this fight dull.

72
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,720
I know!

73
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,140
You don't say...

74
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:00,680
Once again, it has
become a ferocious battle!

75
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,050
Cell is attacking fiercely, and the
unnamed warrior is fighting back!

76
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,360
It's shaking! Even the place
where we're standing is shaking!

77
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,910
How is this going to unfold from here on?

78
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,450
Goku... why...?

79
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,170
Good afternoon!

80
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,590
Oh, Bulma?

81
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,550
Yeah. You've got it on, huh?

82
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,550
I thought that watching this with
an expert and having him explain it

83
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,090
would make it easier to
understand, so I came over.

84
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:49,970
Oh, there, there, there,
what's the matter, Trunks?

85
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,310
That <i>Kamehame-Ha</i> earlier must
have used up a considerable amount

86
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,940
of both of their powers.

87
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,280
And yet, to think that they
could still put up this kind of fight...!

88
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,110
What's the matter, Goku? Is that all you've got?

89
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,530
Damn...

90
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,690
Oh, he got him!

91
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
It's working! Way to go, Goku-<i>san</i>!

92
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,990
Way to go, Goku! One more step!

93
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,030
You're one step away from defeating Cell!

94
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,540
F-Father...

95
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,170
The unnamed young man
has started a ferocious attack!

96
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,180
Cell is in a huge pinch!

97
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,180
But then, inside that thick,
billowing cloud of explosions,

98
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,810
could anyone convey
what exactly is going on?!

99
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,190
We can't see! We can't see a thing!

100
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,190
What's going on?!

101
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,820
Like I said, it is not a malfunction!

102
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,780
Our man is risking his life
to relay this coverage! It's true!

103
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,950
Everyone, cut the phone lines!

104
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,710
He's winning! Goku is winning!

105
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,170
Goku-<i>san</i>!

106
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,880
He's done it!

107
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,590
Goku...!

108
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,600
A-Are you all right, Mister Satan?

109
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,110
Yeah! Hey, I'm jusd doing
some warm-ub egsercizes!

110
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,950
I should have known!

111
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,490
Never refusing to get ready
to fight, that's our Satan-<i>sama,</i>

112
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,580
the greatest combat sportsman in the world!

113
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,290
Y-You mighd say dhad...!

114
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:10,750
Y-Your announcer will not abandon
his microphone, even if I should die!

115
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,960
And so, what could this gigantic ball be?

116
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,860
Son Goku...

117
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:40,160
Your attack was good enough that it
caused me to have to raise a barrier.

118
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,040
I took on more damage than I expected.

119
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,000
That's awesome...

120
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,510
I'm not sure what it is, but it's still incredible.

121
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,890
Say, Mama, this isn't a movie, is it?

122
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:11,520
That man is Chichi-<i>san</i>'s
husband after all, ain't he?

123
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,740
Remember, she was sayin'
recently that he was dyein' his hair.

124
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:20,200
Huh? Yeah, it does look like him.

125
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,410
Come to think of it, he's always
wearin' that garish outfit, huh?

126
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,120
Someone's gossipin' about us, I bet!

127
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:35,170
Goku-<i>sa</i>, hang in there!

128
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,880
Ah, he was so close!

129
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,550
He had just this much farther to go!

130
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,890
"This much farther" nothing!

131
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,100
Sure, it looks like he's putting up a good fight,

132
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,770
but unlike Goku, Cell still
has some breathing room.

133
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,230
Y-You're sure about that?

134
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:58,610
I'm sorry to say it, but Goku can't win.

135
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:05,200
What's more, it looked to me like
Goku knew that while he was fighting.

136
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,290
I-I don't know what he had in mind.

137
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,610
His <i>ki</i> has dropped!

138
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,530
So has Cell's, but Goku's is down severely!

139
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,950
Your strength seems to have
fallen off considerably, Son Goku.

140
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You should swallow one
of those <i>senzu</i> things.

141
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,170
We could have an even
more spectacular battle!

142
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,630
Th-This is our chance!

143
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,310
Like he said, if we give
Goku-<i>san</i> a <i>senzu,</i>

144
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,770
and then everyone gangs up on him,
we could surely defeat Cell now!

145
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,890
You're right! That would work!

146
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,900
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

147
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,550
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, hurry and give him a <i>senzu</i>!

148
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,350
Hold your tongue, Trunks!

149
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:54,810
You don't seem to have
any Saiyan pride, do you?

150
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,900
If he has to win that way,
he would probably prefer to die!

151
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,570
Right now, he's not fighting for Earth!

152
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:09,740
Remember that well!

153
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,290
B-But, at this rate...

154
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:22,750
He'll be done in, that's for certain.

155
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,220
A-As infuriating as it is,

156
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,100
I have to admit that even
as hard as I trained this time,

157
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,190
I couldn't top Kakarrot there.

158
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,730
That bastard has a gift.

159
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,770
However,

160
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,490
Cell has stayed one–sometimes
two steps ahead of even Kakarrot!

161
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,740
In that case, what are we supposed to do?!

162
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,410
Just watch on in silence?!

163
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,750
You said it yourself, didn't you?

164
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,580
That he surely has some kind of strategy?

165
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,460
We'll just count on that.

166
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,760
<i>Goku-san...</i>

167
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,010
<i>Just what sort of strategy have you thought up?</i>

168
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,770
What's the matter?

169
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,190
Is your pride getting in the way,
preventing you from taking a <i>senzu</i>?

170
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,410
Right now, I've lost a
considerable amount of strength.

171
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,120
If you reach your full power,
then the possibility of you winning,

172
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,580
slim though it may be, will increase.

173
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,840
I want to enjoy fighting
with you more and more!

174
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,710
I give up!

175
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,720
I surrender. Cell, I've learned
well how strong you are.

176
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,510
I'm giving up.

177
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,060
W-What?!

178
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,520
Surrender?!

179
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,070
H-He couldn't be...!

180
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,900
G-Goku surrendering?!

181
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,530
Has anything like this ever happened before?!

182
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,530
F-Father...?

183
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,870
What is he thinking?!

184
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,210
But why?! Why would Son-<i>kun,</i>
someone who would never say die...

185
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,420
...surrender now?!

186
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,140
<i>Goku has lost.</i>

187
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,480
<i>What is the fate of the Earth now?</i>

188
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,750
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

189
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:54,590
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

190
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,970
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

191
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,430
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

192
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,940
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

193
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,070
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

194
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,580
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

195
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,200
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

196
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:29,710
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

197
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

198
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,630
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

199
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,640
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

200
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,310
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

201
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>So sorry.</i>

202
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,610
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

203
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,660
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

204
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,090
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

205
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,470
<i>The Cell Games will probably</i>
<i>end after the next person fights.</i>

206
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,220
<i>There ain't anyone else</i>
<i>around who can beat Cell.</i>

207
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,430
<i>Gohan, it's you're turn!</i>

208
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,100
<i>That's preposterous,</i>
<i>Goku! What are you thinking?!</i>

209
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,560
<i>Are you trying to get your own son killed?!</i>

210
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

211
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,650
<i>"He Who Takes Over as Strongest...</i>
<i>His Name is Gohan."</i>

212
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,520
<i>Am I really capable of defeating Cell?</i>

213
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,280
"Next time"
"He Who Takes Over as Strongest...
His Name is Gohan"
