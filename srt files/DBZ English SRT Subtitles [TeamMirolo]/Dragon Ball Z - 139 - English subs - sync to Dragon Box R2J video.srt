<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,480
<i>The terrifying Artificial Humans</i>

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,890

20
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,370
<i>And, in order to escape the Artificial Humans,</i>

21
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,640
<i>Kuririn and the others</i>
<i>take the still-sleeping Goku,</i>

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,480

<i>"An Ominous Foreboding!</i>

Yum!

25
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,740
This ramen definitely makes
the cut. Chaozu, you do good work.

26
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,310
Is that so?

27
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,540
The soup is delicious, nice and full-bodied.

28
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,450
You could get by as a cook with food like this.

29
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,880
Compared to the stuff Kuririn
always makes us, yours is fantastic!

30
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,850
How is it you can make it so well?

31
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,290
I'm always the one who fixed Ten<i>-san</i>'s meals.

32
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,300
And so, little by little...

33
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,210
How about it, Chaozu?

34
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,020
Why don't you continue
staying here with us some?

35
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,880
B-But...

36
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,090
It won't be so bad here, training at your leisure.

37
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,590
Isn't that just what he wants to hear?

38
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,030
You really just want Chaozu
to keep on cooking for you!

39
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,630
R-Rubbish! I wasn't
thinking anything of the sort!

40
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,430
Sure you weren't.

41
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,100
No, really...

42
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,840
Ten<i>-san</i>!

43
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,470
Tenshinhan...

44
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,440
Chaozu, let's go.

45
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
We have training to do.

46
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,520
Hold on there, Tenshinhan!
What about the Artificial Humans?

47
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,320
Did you guys defeat the Artificial Humans?

48
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,160
What's that?

49
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,160
You don't mean...? In that case...

50
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,860
Is everyone okay?

51
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,300
It's all right. Nobody has died yet.

52
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,040
Very soon, Kuririn and the
others will be bringing Goku here.

53
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,840
Please have them fill you in.

54
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,040
W-What?

55
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,050
Wait for me, Ten<i>-san</i>!

56
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,490
So what could have possibly happened?

57
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,660
...so, to them it's like a game,

58
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,060
but in any case, they intended to come kill Goku.

59
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,870
A-Are they really all that strong?

60
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,670
Yep.

61
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,610
You can even think of them as stronger
than what Trunks warned us about.

62
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,220
This is terrible!

63
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,860
All this time's been gettin'
away while we've been sittin' here.

64
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,860
What a waste!

65
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,890
What's the matter, Mother?

66
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,870
Well, get to it!

67
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,170
At a time like this?

68
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,440
No matter what time it is, studyin' is important!

69
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,440
You really are something else, Chichi<i>-san.</i>

70
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,440
So what do we do now?

71
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:35,280
Not that I would know... What should we do?

72
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,310
H-How does this sound?

73
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,620
What if I took the time
machine back further into the past,

74
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,060
and destroy them before they're activated?

75
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,600
I know the location of
Doctor Gero's laboratory and all...

76
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,870
I get you. That's a good idea, isn't it?

77
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,640
Hold on. I thought your time machine
didn't quite work perfectly, did it?

78
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,310
And from what Goku said,

79
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:07,150
it takes an awfully long time to store
enough energy to make a round trip, right?

80
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:12,150
If you go further into the past, are
you sure you can return to your future?

81
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,550
Not exactly...

82
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,490
You know, I was thinking,

83
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,890
if Trunks<i>-san</i> goes back a little further in time,

84
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,560
and even if you're able to
destroy the Artificial Humans there,

85
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,430
what will happen to the
Artificial Humans that are here now?

86
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,830
Will they suddenly disappear?

87
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,170
Gohan, you should just
be studyin' like a good boy.

88
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,510
T-That's right! I'd forgotten!

89
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,080
Undoubtedly, if I were to go back to
the past and destroy the Artificial Humans,

90
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,450
the future of that world
of that time would be saved.

91
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,850
But in this world, where the
Artificial Humans are already activated,

92
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,850
nothing would be changed.

93
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,850
How does that follow?

94
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,520
Let's see... For example,

95
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,460
Goku<i>-san</i> managed to hold on to
his life with the heart medicine...

96
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,330
...I brought him from the future.

97
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,470
However, in my future,

98
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,500
Goku remains long dead from his heart disease.

99
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,480
In other words, while there may
be a future where Goku<i>-san</i> survives,

100
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,210
there's still another one where he died.

101
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,620
From very minor events,
many different futures are created.

102
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,890
Just a minute, Trunks...

103
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,850
You mean, even supposing that...

104
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,520
...Goku is capable of
defeating the Artificial Humans,

105
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,560
In your future, won't they
still exist there, same as ever?

106
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,430
That's right.

107
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,870
In that case, Trunks, what
did you even come here for?

108
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,900
After all, your world won't be changed.

109
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,950
Mom...

110
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,050
Mom was so ticked off by us always
being clobbered by the Artificial Humans,

111
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,660
she thought it would be nice
if there was a peaceful future...

112
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,100
...where they had been beaten.

113
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,500
But her primary goal was to have me
fight with Goku against the Artificial Humans,

114
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:10,200
to find a weakness in them.

115
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,870
If that didn't work,

116
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,670
I would have had Goku come to
our future to defeat them there,

117
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,310
or something like that.

118
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,420
<i>What will become of us?</i>

119
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,160
<i>I don't know.</i>

120
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:45,310
<i>Even more important</i>
<i>than what will become of us,</i>

121
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,650
<i>What are we to do?</i>

122
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,140
Forgive me.

123
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:24,080
Anyhow, it appears I've come to a
different past than the one I knew of.

124
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,080
The timing of Goku<i>-san</i>'s
heart disease was off, for one.

125
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,890
For another, there are
now three Artificial Humans...

126
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:39,660
<i>Everything we can do.</i>
Their strength so much greater...

127
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,480
<i>What will become of us?</i>

128
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,420
But why is it that so
many things are differen–?

129
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,490
I don't know. Why is it this bad?

130
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,860
I-Is it because of me coming
back in the time machine?

131
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,200
There's nothin' for you to be frettin' about.

132
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,070
If you hadn't come,

133
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,470
Goku would've died from his sickness.

134
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,510
I'm terribly grateful to you.

135
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,420
That's the right idea.
Something's going to turn up.

136
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
Y-Yeah, absolutely right!

137
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,270
We've been through so much before.

138
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,910
Something's bound to
come up this time too! Isn't it?

139
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,300
Incidentally, do you even know where he is?

140
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,300
This Son Goku?

141
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,870
We'll come across that information before long.

142
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,740
You mean you don't know?

143
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,250
My, my, I suppose it's just a matter of time.

144
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,110
There is a mountain
village in eastern sector 439...

145
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,250
...where Son Goku's house is located.

146
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:47,950
You're quite the know-it-all.

147
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,260
Did you learn that from Doctor Gero?

148
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,760
That's right.

149
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,760
If we flew, we could be
there in a matter of minutes.

150
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,760
Isn't that the truth! You say all the right things.

151
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,170
Yet you still want to take
the trouble to drive there.

152
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:03,300
What's the point?

153
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,100
Stop saying that.

154
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,140
The point is to have fun, isn't it?

155
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,210
So this is where you are, Son Goku?

156
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,160
We've been looking for you, really.

157
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,120
Are you guys Artificial Humans?

158
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,320
Yeah. We're the ones who killed Doctor Gero.

159
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,960
Now it's your turn to die.

160
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,960
Dammit!

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
Stop!

162
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,170
If you take one more step towards
my father, you'll answer to me!

163
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,340
Gohan! Kuririn!

164
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:13,340
Do you expect to stand in our way?

165
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,340
Apparently, they want to die.

166
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,580
Stop!

167
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,090
W-Why, you...

168
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:36,360
That's better.

169
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,960
Otherwise, this wouldn't be as fun.

170
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,240
Stop! Don't you do it!

171
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,880
Chichi!

172
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,580
Out of the way!

173
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,350
I said move it!

174
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,590
Stop!

175
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,760
Chichi!

176
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,890
Trunks...

177
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,160
Are you here for another beating?

178
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,160
Trunks, stop!

179
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,310
Damn you!

180
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:00,980
Now, then...

181
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,190
Stop!

182
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,570
Stop!!

183
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,640
Father!

184
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,340
Snap out of it, Goku!

185
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,010
Let me through!

186
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,960
Goku<i>-san</i> is even fighting in his dreams.

187
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,130
Yeah, really.

188
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,570
That sounds like Goku.

189
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,350
<i>Is the man Son Goku even stronger?</i>

190
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,020
<i>No kidding? Neither one of</i>
<i>you is all that great, are you?</i>

191
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,960
Wasn't the Super Saiyan supposed
to be invincible throughout the land?!

192
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,590
So what happened?!

193
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,160
How did it come to
that–that debacle I suffered?

194
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,110
I-I am the super-elite prince of the Saiyans!

195
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,910
And then, by becoming a Super Saiyan,

196
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,540
I should have been greatest in the universe!

197
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,950
Is it because my opponents
were Artificial Humans?

198
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,980
Is this the most I will ever be?

199
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,170
No!

200
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,070
There's still more to be had! I am Vegeta!

201
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,710
No matter how strong my
enemy is, I will surpass them!

202
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,410
I will surpass them!

203
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,950
Count on it!

204
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,150
And Kakarrot, after I beat the
Artificial Humans, you're next!

205
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,330
We'll be at Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>'s
island pretty soon.

206
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,330
Say, Kuririn, shouldn't you let
Bulma know what's been going on?

207
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,770
Yes, you're right.

208
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:13,970
But you want me to contact her? Aw, man...

209
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:17,480
You're the one who knows
the situation best. Please?

210
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,140
All right.

211
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,380
Your mother sure has a sharp tongue.

212
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,980
She's no different in the future.

213
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,330
Er, this is Kuririn calling, is Bulma<i>-san</i> there?

214
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,570
Ah, yes, Mistress Bulma. One moment please.

215
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:53,780
Kuririn! What, you mean you're okay?

216
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,350
Where are you calling from?

217
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:01,150
I thought Gohan<i>-kun</i>
should have been back by now,

218
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,160
but when I called his house, no one was there.

219
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,090
Wait, never mind that, is the future
grown-up son of mine, Trunks there?

220
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,100
Yes, he's right here.

221
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,100
He's there?

222
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,300
Great! Would you let me speak to him?

223
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,540
You can go ahead and talk now,
he can hear you over the speaker.

224
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,010
Okay. Well, the company here got an inquiry...

225
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,940
...from some folks in a rural area to the west.

226
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,950
They came across a strange abandoned vehicle,

227
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,350
and they wanted to keep it for themselves.

228
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:34,050
However, they couldn't figure
out for the world how to start it up,

229
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,250
and they were asking if we could tell them.

230
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,020
Right.

231
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,220
So we asked them over the
phone what model vehicle it was,

232
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,130
but they didn't know.

233
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,900
We asked them if they were sure it
was one of our products, and they said,

234
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,230
"It says right here on the
body, 'Capsule Corporation'."

235
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,870
We told them, in that case,
please send us a photo, and they did.

236
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:57,880
I was so surprised when I saw the photo!

237
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,580
It was the time machine
Trunks rode in, but it's damaged!

238
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,350
That can't be right...

239
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,320
No, it's right here.

240
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,320
I turned it into a capsule and took it with me.

241
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,330
He says it's right here with him.

242
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,330
I see, naturally...

243
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,630
So this isn't the one he came in.

244
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,140
There's some moss or something
stuck to it, making it seem pretty old,

245
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,770
so I thought it was kind of strange.

246
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,310
Say, how many time machines
did my future self build?

247
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,550
How many? It was all she
could manage to make just one.

248
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:38,320
That's strange.

249
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,750
This is definitely a time machine.

250
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:44,260
I saw the one you were in
before, so I couldn't mistake it.

251
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,160
Hey, do you have a fax there?
Take a look at this photo!

252
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,570
Trunks, here.

253
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:10,150
Unmistakable. This is the same
time machine I rode back in.

254
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,320
What does this mean?

255
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,120
<i>What's this? A time machine, identical to Trunks'.</i>

256
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,690
<i>A cold shiver is followed</i>
<i>by an ominous foreboding.</i>

257
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,690
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

258
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,530
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

259
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

260
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

261
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,910
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

262
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,010
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

263
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,520
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

264
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

265
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,660
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

266
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,760
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

267
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,570
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

268
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,600
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

269
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,280
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

270
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,450
<i>So sorry.</i>

271
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,580
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

272
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,590
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

273
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,470
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

274
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:18,340
<i>You found a strange egg inside</i>
<i>the older-looking time machine?</i>

275
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,410
<i>I've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

276
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,080
<i>It arrived here four whole years ago.</i>

277
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,020
<i>Could history have changed</i>
<i>so much because of this?</i>

278
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,990
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

279
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,520
<i>"The Discovery of an Evil Egg!!</i>
<i>A Terrified Trunks."</i>

280
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,370
<i>Trunks-san, there's a large shell over here.</i>

281
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,300
"Next time"
"The Discovery of an Evil Egg!!
A Terrified Trunks"
