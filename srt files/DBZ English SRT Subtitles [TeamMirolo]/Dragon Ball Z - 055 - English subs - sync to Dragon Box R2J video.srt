<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,065
My power has shot up!

17
00:02:09,575 --> 00:02:13,245
Bring Vegeta here at once.

18
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:28,085
You're still alive, huh?
As a result, I'm going to be spared.

19
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:43,375
<i>Who is it that will be able</i>
<i>to put a stop to Freeza's ambitions?</i>

20
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:53,115
<i>"Back from the Brink of Death –</i>
<i>The Miracle Man, Vegeta."</i>

21
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:24,815
This 50-times gravity
is as tough as you'd expect.

22
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:32,555
<i>Yamucha and the others must be going at it.</i>

23
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:34,925
<i>I wonder if it's the same training that I did.</i>

24
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:40,555
<i>No, I can't afford to be doing that.</i>

25
00:03:47,605 --> 00:03:49,575
Damn...

26
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:52,775
Mock me, will you?

27
00:03:56,515 --> 00:03:58,505
O-One more time!

28
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,425
And he was so close, too?

29
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:16,535
M-My body is so heavy...

30
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:19,535
You almost had him, huh?

31
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:21,765
All right, now me.

32
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:27,205
Here goes!

33
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:30,015
Ten<i>-san</i>, good luck!

34
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:33,545
Don't rush, now. Take your time.

35
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,185
What?

36
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:42,625
I have no intention of doing
the same training as those guys.

37
00:04:46,605 --> 00:04:48,865
Teach me your techniques now.

38
00:04:48,905 --> 00:04:55,205
I can't do that. There is an order
to these things, you know... huh?

39
00:04:55,245 --> 00:05:02,205
Anyhow, when you try to jump straight
to the end, things are apt to turn out badly.

40
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:06,245
By the way, if you're not doing anything,
would you like to pull weeds with me?

41
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:22,165
Why are you in such a hurry to grow stronger?

42
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:29,375
You promised me that you had
given up on defeating Freeza, didn't you?

43
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:35,905
For shame. Liars have to swallow
a thousand needles, you know.

44
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:41,915
For that matter, you should be enjoying
your life here in the Next World more.

45
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,915
This can be quite fun to do.

46
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:48,255
Hmph! You're just playing the fool.

47
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:50,785
Huh? Are you leaving?

48
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,165
D-Damn...

49
00:05:58,205 --> 00:06:02,375
Hey! Let's eat!

50
00:06:15,885 --> 00:06:20,525
Son Goku was something else,
but you guys eat a lot too, huh?

51
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:22,185
We can't be outdone by Goku!

52
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:24,895
If he ate 10 bowls, then I'll eat 20!

53
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:29,525
Hey, come on now! If you don't
stop now, you'll eat my portion, too...

54
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:30,865
Besides,

55
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,865
it's pretty good.

56
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,165
Oh, it is, it is, huh?

57
00:06:35,205 --> 00:06:39,205
I know I may not look it, but when I was
a youngster, I went to this cooking class,

58
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:44,175
and I was so good the teacher there told
me I would make a good husband someday,

59
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:48,515
so I'm somewhat confident of
my ability to– huh? Hey, you guys!

60
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:51,785
Ah, all full, all full...

61
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:58,365
Good grief. The dead these
days have no sense of moderation.

62
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:16,485
Okay, now that my belly is full, I'll be fine.

63
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:20,055
I'll catch you this time for sure.

64
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:28,295
You won't be able to do that to me any longer.

65
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,145
Got you!

66
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:56,485
He did it!

67
00:07:57,855 --> 00:07:59,415
I did it!

68
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:08,095
I'm surprised you can get by on just water.

69
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,845
I did it!

70
00:08:23,885 --> 00:08:25,515
You did it, Tenshinhan!

71
00:08:25,555 --> 00:08:27,455
Ten<i>-san</i>, incredible!

72
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,115
Those guys are something else.

73
00:08:30,155 --> 00:08:33,625
Once they've gotten a handle on
this, they'll make rapid progress.

74
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:35,855
Don't you think so?

75
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:38,055
I have no interest in those small fry.

76
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:45,705
I will not allow the existence of anyone
stronger than me. That's all there is to it.

77
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,305
I did it! I did it!

78
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:52,245
I caught him! Look!

79
00:08:54,815 --> 00:09:00,345
Oh? Oh, my! Even Chaozu
has mastered this, has he?

80
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:08,485
I see. All right, I'll give
you your next training lesson.

81
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:11,025
Hey, Gregory!

82
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:28,505
Hi! Hello, everybody! I am Gregory!

83
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:33,485
This guy is your next opponent.

84
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:36,585
Please knock me down as
hard as you can with this hammer.

85
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,515
You don't need to hold back.

86
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:40,185
However...

87
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:43,825
That assumes that you
can keep up with my speed.

88
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:46,335
All right, I'll do it.

89
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:48,065
Here.

90
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:53,465
W-What's with this weight?!

91
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:56,675
Ready? Here we go!

92
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:00,175
B-Bring it on!

93
00:10:00,215 --> 00:10:01,205
Okay...

94
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:07,185
Too slow, too slow!

95
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:09,185
D-Damn!

96
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,855
Yamucha, hang in there!

97
00:10:10,895 --> 00:10:13,085
Yamucha<i>-san</i>, fight!

98
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:19,455
Hey, Piccolo, aren't you going to do this?

99
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:24,165
It's a waste of time. I'll train by myself.

100
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:26,905
Piccolo...

101
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:47,115
Chaozu...

102
00:10:51,165 --> 00:10:55,095
What's the matter? Are you giving up already?

103
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:57,435
D-Dammit!

104
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:02,035
Hey! We're going to take a nap now!

105
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:09,145
Piccolo is sleeping comfortably out back.
Don't push yourselves too hard.

106
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:13,955
I-I'm not about to be lumped
in with that guy! I'm up next!

107
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:17,155
My, my...

108
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:19,715
Oh, dear...

109
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:33,865
<i>There's someone even stronger than that Saiyan.</i>

110
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:50,185
How is he?

111
00:11:50,225 --> 00:11:54,525
His condition is fairly serious.
His life signs are extremely faint.

112
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:58,855
Even if he does pull through, I'm not sure
whether or not he will regain consciousness.

113
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:00,965
Make sure he recovers, no matter what it takes!

114
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:02,865
Use whatever methods you have to, understand?!

115
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,865
Y-Yes, sir.

116
00:12:04,905 --> 00:12:08,735
<i>Otherwise, it will mean my life.</i>

117
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,025
All right...

118
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:09,095
Hey, hey! You can do it, you can do it!

119
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:13,435
Chaozu, go easy on him! Easy!

120
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:18,435
–Okay, this is it, the bottom
of the 9th, 2 outs, bases loaded!
–All right, Chaozu, go!

121
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:22,775
–The count is 3-2. If he runs away,
the walk scores a run, and it's goodbye!
–Knock it out of here!

122
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:27,485
M-Me, run away?! You're
trying to make a fool of me!

123
00:13:29,155 --> 00:13:34,455
V-Very well, I'll show you!
It's not going to be that easy!

124
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:37,125
Any time you're ready.

125
00:13:37,165 --> 00:13:40,825
W-Why, you! Hit this one, if you can!

126
00:13:47,445 --> 00:13:49,435
<i>Not so fast! Forkball!</i>

127
00:13:53,845 --> 00:13:55,335
"Crack!"

128
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,245
W-W-What was that?!

129
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:06,755
When you go <i>out</i>, call <i>out</i> to
someone first, and lock everyone else <i>out</i>!

130
00:14:06,795 --> 00:14:11,755
That was a come-from-behind,
bases-loaded, say-goodbye home run.

131
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:15,095
Oh my, Gregory, what are you doing?

132
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:17,435
With Chaozu's hit just now,
we've all cleared him.

133
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:19,095
That's right.

134
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:23,105
What's that? Is this true, Gregory?

135
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:28,375
T-These guys didn't hold back at all.

136
00:14:30,115 --> 00:14:32,055
Wow, that was fast, huh?

137
00:14:33,485 --> 00:14:39,455
Oh, my, just over an hour? Are
you sure you're not going too fast?

138
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:42,555
Okay, Kaio<i>-sama</i>, please
give us our next training.

139
00:14:44,165 --> 00:14:47,295
Next, we will spar.

140
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,965
Nothing is better than
sparring to learn each other's

141
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,395
strengths and weaknesses, after all.

142
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:54,735
As a matter of fact,
we've been waiting for this.

143
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,065
Ready to go at it?

144
00:14:56,105 --> 00:15:00,075
Oh, hold on, hold on,
I'll determine the match-ups.

145
00:15:00,115 --> 00:15:03,745
Let's see, who should I put you with?

146
00:15:03,785 --> 00:15:05,415
I'll do this!

147
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:12,755
Oh ho, you've woken up, have you?
All right then, Piccolo and–

148
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:14,755
–All the rest of them.
–Wha–?

149
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:15,585
What?!

150
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,255
You think I can fight decently against someone

151
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,095
who had trouble with a monkey, or some batter?

152
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:23,765
At your level, even if there were
ten of you, you'd still be a pushover.

153
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:26,765
You bastard, now you've said it!

154
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:32,935
My, my, what a humorless conversation
this is. Did you come here to fight?

155
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:37,445
Well, there is some truth to what Piccolo says.

156
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:38,445
Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

157
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:43,785
To be honest, at your current ability,
a one-on-one fight would be absurd.

158
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:45,785
But with all three of you, perhaps–

159
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,785
Don't be ridiculous!

160
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:50,555
They don't even have a
1 in 10,000 chance of winning.

161
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:55,425
What's the matter? You want to go at it?

162
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:56,495
All right!

163
00:16:03,145 --> 00:16:06,775
<i>Watch this. I'll put you away in five seconds.</i>

164
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:09,515
Ready? Begin!

165
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,795
What?!

166
00:16:25,835 --> 00:16:26,925
What the–?!

167
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:37,805
They're surprisingly tough, aren't they?

168
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:40,475
Whooee! That smarts!

169
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:41,875
W-Why, you!

170
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,015
W-Why, you!

171
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,095
Chaozu!

172
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:08,705
Are you okay, Chaozu?!

173
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:11,405
Hey, don't panic.

174
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:16,045
–You guys are already dead. You don't
need to worry yourself pointlessly.
–But...

175
00:17:16,085 --> 00:17:20,485
The pain of the body is just a remnant of
when you were alive. It will soon be gone.

176
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:26,755
3... 2... 1... there.

177
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,435
Huh?

178
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,805
See?

179
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:47,275
<i>How? Up until a little while ago,</i>
<i>their movements were so slow,</i>

180
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,045
<i>and suddenly, I barely recognize them.</i>

181
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:51,715
<i>Is this because of Kaio's</i>
<i>training? It couldn't be...</i>

182
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:53,655
Resume sparring!

183
00:18:27,785 --> 00:18:28,945
Piccolo...

184
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:31,615
Take off your weights.

185
00:18:31,655 --> 00:18:34,825
Yeah, and then we'll fight you again.

186
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:43,425
That same trick isn't going to work anymore.

187
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:45,435
All right!

188
00:18:45,475 --> 00:18:48,705
Okay, that's enough.

189
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:53,975
That's all for sparring. We're moving on
to the next training. Everyone come with me.

190
00:19:10,095 --> 00:19:11,255
Oh, right...

191
00:19:12,765 --> 00:19:16,725
A vegetable you eat in the morning that
makes you fart is called <i>asa-</i>para-gas...
[<i>asa</i>: morning]

192
00:19:16,765 --> 00:19:19,935
<i>...asa</i> paragas<i>...asa</i> paragas!

193
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:23,365
That was a great one!

194
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:25,745
R-Right...

195
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:56,365
There's quite a bit of damage
here. There may be no hope.

196
00:19:56,405 --> 00:20:00,035
I'm counting on you. If you
don't regain consciousness,

197
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:04,375
<i>I'm</i> the one who Freeza<i>-sama</i>
is going to take it out on, after all.

198
00:20:04,415 --> 00:20:06,715
Then again, even if you
do come back to life here,

199
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:11,055
you'll be on your way to hell again by
Freeza<i>-sama</i>'s hand soon enough anyhow.

200
00:20:11,755 --> 00:20:14,055
That should do it.

201
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:17,725
Well, all there is to do now
is wait for you to wake up.

202
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:20,395
Don't give us any more trouble, okay?

203
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:23,135
Vegeta<i>-chan</i>?

204
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:38,075
How is Vegeta?

205
00:20:38,115 --> 00:20:41,415
He should regain consciousness shortly.

206
00:20:41,455 --> 00:20:43,745
That is good, huh?

207
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,785
Y-Yes, sir.

208
00:20:48,765 --> 00:20:52,055
W-What was that explosion just now?!

209
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,535
It cannot be!

210
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:05,805
Looks like you've underestimated
my powers of recovery, huh?

211
00:21:07,115 --> 00:21:08,775
Now, then...

212
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:17,415
Dammit, it's coming from
the treatment chamber, all right!

213
00:21:17,455 --> 00:21:19,185
Zarbon<i>-san</i>, hurry!

214
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:28,125
Oh, no! He escaped outside!

215
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:29,425
He did what?!

216
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:32,435
<i>Terrific, Freeza is with him!</i>

217
00:21:32,475 --> 00:21:35,105
Hurry! Hurry and go after him!

218
00:21:35,145 --> 00:21:36,835
Why, you!

219
00:21:38,475 --> 00:21:42,675
Hurry! You must find him at all costs!
He could not have gotten far yet!

220
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:47,975
<i>Fools! You fell for it all too easily.</i>

221
00:22:02,505 --> 00:22:04,465
<i>Dear Freeza-sama,</i>

222
00:22:04,505 --> 00:22:08,805
<i>Allow me to take this current opportunity</i>
<i>to inform you that your era is at an end.</i>

223
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:12,175
<i>–Your loving Vegeta.</i>

224
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:19,145
I have won!

225
00:22:19,185 --> 00:22:23,815
<i>Vegeta, the miracle man who</i>
<i>returned from the brink of death...</i>

226
00:22:23,855 --> 00:22:29,355
<i>Will he be able to outwit</i>
<i>Freeza and collect the Dragon Balls?</i>

227
00:22:44,475 --> 00:22:48,505
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

228
00:22:48,545 --> 00:22:54,345
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

229
00:22:54,385 --> 00:22:56,725
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

230
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:05,225
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

231
00:23:07,505 --> 00:23:11,735
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

232
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:15,805
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

233
00:23:15,845 --> 00:23:19,305
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

234
00:23:19,345 --> 00:23:21,975
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

235
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:29,485
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

236
00:23:31,695 --> 00:23:33,585
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

237
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,385
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

238
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:39,425
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

239
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:45,095
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

240
00:23:45,135 --> 00:23:47,265
<i>So sorry.</i>

241
00:23:47,305 --> 00:23:52,375
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

242
00:23:55,145 --> 00:24:00,385
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

243
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:13,795
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

244
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:18,325
<i>Damn, I have to hurry, or Vegeta</i>
<i>will collect all the Dragon Balls!</i>

245
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:23,165
<i>Just how far is luck going to go my way?!</i>

246
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:26,205
<i>It serves you right, Freeza!</i>

247
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,175
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

248
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:31,615
<i>"An Enormous Battle Power!!</i>
<i>Freeza's Scheme is Shattered."</i>

249
00:24:31,655 --> 00:24:35,685
<i>Father, I'm going to protect the last Ball!</i>

250
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:38,085
"Next time"
"An Enormous Battle Power!!
Freeza's Scheme is Shattered"
