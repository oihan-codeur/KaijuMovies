Fusion and Super Saiyan 3, after all!

What, what? What's he doing?

109
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,510
Huh? He's become round, like a ball!

Here he comes again!

You have to hurry and do it right,
or Majin Boo will come on out!

137

And I can only stay in this

Huh? Maybe he really did die.

161
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,440
You've got me there!

162
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,400
I guess that was a little disappointing, huh?
I wonder if I've gotten too strong!

163
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,360
Look out!

164
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:07,210
<i>Super Gotenks 3 exhibits ferocious strength!</i>

165
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:12,470
<i>However, What's more fearsome</i>
<i>is Majin Boo's depth of strength!</i>

166
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,010
<i>Who will come out the victor</i>
<i>in this battle of the strongest?</i>

167
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,780
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

168
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,370
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

169
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,930
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

170
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:02,060
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

171
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:09,020
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

172
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:14,400
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

173
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,280
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

174
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:27,380
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

175
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,920
<i>Even now?</i>

176
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,550
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

177
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,930
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

178
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:48,440
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

179
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:58,450
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

180
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,340
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

181
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,880
<i>This is bad. The little guys'</i>
<i>Fusion has powered down.</i>

182
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,260
<i>Old-time Kaioshin-sama,</i>
<i>ain't Gohan's training done yet?</i>

183
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,350
<i>Don't panic. We finished a while ago.</i>

184
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,390
<i>I intentionally didn't say</i>
<i>anything until things got tight.</i>

185
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,350
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

186
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:33,730
<i>"Truly 'Great'!!</i>
<i>A Reborn Gohan Returns to Earth."</i>

187
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,150
<i>I never knew I had this</i>
<i>kind of power inside me.</i>

188
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,590
"Next time"
"Truly 'Great'!!
A Reborn Gohan Returns to Earth"
