<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,300
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,060
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,690
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,950
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,700
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,290

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,640

00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,650
<i>My head is clear,</i>

<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,830

<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,140
Everybody on Earth! I beg you!
I beg you, share your <i>Genki</i> with me!

24
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:07,150
<i>Hearing Goku's cry, his dear friends from</i>
<i>the past raised their hands one after another!</i>

25
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,870
<i>And then, as a result</i>
<i>of Mister Satan's actions,</i>

26
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,410
<i>the Genki of the whole</i>
<i>earth amazingly became as one!</i>

27
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,670
All right! That's it! Go!

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,520
It's done!

29
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,360
<i>At last, the Super Genki Dama was complete!</i>

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,730
<i>The long battle with Majin Boo</i>
<i>was at last facing its final phase!</i>

31
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,780
Get back, Vegeta! Here it goes!!

32
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:02,370
<i>"Son Goku is Strongest After All!!</i>
<i>Majin Boo is Eliminated."</i>

33
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,440
Vegeta! Get out of the way, quickly!

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,860
Would you shut up?! I can't move my body!

35
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,280
Y-You what?!

36
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,620
You've got to give it your all, and
somehow get away from there, Vegeta!

37
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,700
You'll be caught in the blast!

38
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,710
S-Stupid bastard!

39
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,080
D-Don't worry about me!
Hurry up and get him, dammit!

40
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,440
D-Damn you!

41
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,450
V-Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

42
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,910
He can't throw the <i>Genki Dama</i> like this!

43
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,620
G-Goku-<i>san</i>!

44
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,920
It's that softness that will cost you your lives!

45
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,260
Boo! Give it to them, now!

46
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,850
K-Kakarrot! If you are one of the fighting
Saiyan people, then do not hesitate!

47
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,850
Yeah, but...!

48
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,000
K-Kakarrot!

49
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,220
Vegeta!

50
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,350
Dammit!

51
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,360
Boo...!

52
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,870
Boo!

53
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,870
Boo! Are you all right?!

54
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,120
Boo!

55
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,920
Boo!

56
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,350
Boo... What on earth...?

57
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,860
No!

58
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,730
Goku! If you get finished off,

59
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,610
then that <i>Genki Dama</i> you
worked so hard for means nothing!

60
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,490
Give it to him, Goku! Give it to him!

61
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,760
D-Damn it all!

62
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,430
It's no use!

63
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,600
Vegeta, I'm sorry!

64
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,950
Satan!

65
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,340
S-So that's it! All right!

66
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm sorry, Boo!

67
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,320
Damn it, man, do it!! Put him away now!!

68
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,030
Nice work, Satan!
You really could be the world's...

69
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,670
...savior!!

70
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,670
Burn in hell!

71
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,770
Go!!

72
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
W-What?!

73
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,420
Dammit! Go, go!!

74
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:04,150
Do you hear me, Gohan?

75
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,030
Yes, Piccolo-<i>san</i>. Do you feel it?

76
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,700
There's an incredible collision of
<i>ki</i> happening! It's Boo and Father!

77
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:18,710
Yeah. Apparently, they're
fighting in the Kaioshin Realm.

78
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,710
In that holy region? So that's it.

79
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,550
If it's the Kaioshin Realm, then unless
Kibit-<i>san</i> were here, we can't go to their aid.

80
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,970
For the time being, let's
go to the Heavenly Realm.

81
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:33,060
We should be able to feel Goku
and the others' <i>ki</i> more strongly there!

82
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,640
Right!

83
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,520
Hey, squirts! You guys come too! Hurry!

84
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,280
D-Dammit!

85
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:57,000
Th-This ain't just my power here!
This is the genki of all Earthlings!

86
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,790
Th-That's why there ain't no way...
no way I can allow us to lose!!

87
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,470
Piccolo!

88
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Gohan!

89
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,610
Gohan-<i>kun...</i>

90
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,990
You dummy, you dummy!
I was so worried about you!

91
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,160
U-Um, you don't need to cry so hard...

92
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:42,170
W-What's this?! Are you leavin' me,
your own Ma out?! You're my Gohan!

93
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,960
Now, now, it's all right, isn't it?

94
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,540
It'd look bad if he had a mother complex.

95
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,310
Trunks!

96
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,770
Goten!

97
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:08,980
<i>This is strange... Goku's ki is</i>
<i>getting weaker than it was earlier.</i>

98
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,530
W-What the hell is taking
you so long, Kakarrot?!

99
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,780
Damn! I can't muster enough power!

100
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,380
D-Dammit! Damn it all! We were so close!

101
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,680
S-So that's it. We miscalculated!

102
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,590
There's not enough strength left in Kakarrot,

103
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,640
which is so critical in
throwing the <i>Genki Dama</i>!

104
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,730
Dammit...!

105
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:18,090
Th-This is bad! I wonder if that <i>Genki Dama</i>
thing is still lacking a little bit of power.

106
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,470
Th-That can't be! W-We've
already used up all of our <i>ki</i>!

107
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,690
J-Just how tough is this guy–Boo?

108
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,520
H-Hang in there, Son Goku!

109
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,200
That <i>Genki Dama</i> has power from
the Other World in there too, you know!

110
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:22,320
Dende! Do something!
Raise Kakarrot's strength!

111
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,130
P-Please take me to where Goku-<i>san</i> is!

112
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,800
I-I'm sorry, I used up all my strength just now.

113
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,510
Until I recover it, I cannot
instantaneously move.

114
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,140
I-It can't be!

115
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:48,480
I-I'm sorry, Vegeta-<i>san</i>! Our power is
gone as well, and we cannot come there!

116
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,650
Then it's all or nothing!

117
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:55,520
Hey, Satan, gather the <i>Genki</i> from
those guys on Earth one more time!

118
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:05,370
Raise the power of the <i>Genki Dama,</i>
and squash that Boo bastard! Make it fast!

119
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,550
W-Wait, Vegeta! You can't do that!

120
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,520
Everyone has yet to recover their strength!

121
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,520
If you suck out their
<i>Genki</i> again, everyone will die!

122
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,780
Are you trying to take the Earthlings you
brought back to life and kill them all again?

123
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,040
You shut up, Kaio!

124
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:54,250
If we lose to Boo like this now,
they can't remain alive anyhow!

125
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,510
Now, do it! Power-up the <i>Genki Dama</i>!

126
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,520
Hurry it up! There's no time!

127
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,690
I-It's no use! I can't muster the power!

128
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,660
Understood. I will call out to everyone again.

129
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,080
Stop, Mister Satan!

130
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,710
Provided that this was all my...

131
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:55,440
...all in my dream...

132
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,440
What?

133
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,490
However, this is no dream!
I can't believe it, but this is reality!

134
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,200
I'm sorry, but I cannot do anything that
would allow the people of Earth to die!

135
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,460
Hey! Listen to me well!

136
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,130
We can just bring back to life those
who die again with the Dragon Balls!

137
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:31,140
Besides, we still have
our third wish left, and so...!

138
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,680
That's it!

139
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,640
Dende! The third wish!

140
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,730
Th-That's right!

141
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,820
Do you still not have a third wish?

142
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,410
In that case, if you would
allow me to disappear...

143
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,580
W-Wait! Polunga-<i>san</i>!

144
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,170
C-Can you raise the strength
of the person named Son Goku,

145
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,510
who is now fighting Majin Boo in
the Kaioshin Realm, back to normal?

146
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:09,510
If all I must do is return that person's level of
strength to its usual level, then it is possible.

147
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,890
Thank goodness!
D-Do that right away, if you please!

148
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,770
Okay!

149
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:30,570
I-I-It's no use!

150
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:56,600
Goku-<i>san</i>! With the third wish, Goku-<i>san,</i>
your strength should be returning to normal!

151
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,060
It's back! It's back!!

152
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,360
Thank you, Dragon Balls!

153
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,790
He did it!

154
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,510
Very, very nice!

155
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,680
Way to go!

156
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Father's <i>ki</i>...!

157
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,980
It suddenly swelled up!

158
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:09,510
You are awesome!
You fought well, all by yourself!

159
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,510
You changed forms so many times...

160
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,260
...so much so that I was
finally getting tired of it.

161
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,610
This time, get reborn as a good guy!

162
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,400
I want to fight you,
one-on-one. I'll be waiting for you!

163
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,900
And I will have gotten much, much better!

164
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,630
See you later!

165
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,050
Goku-<i>san</i>!

166
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,050
Kakarrot!

167
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,050
Father!

168
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,760
Goku!

169
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,770
Go!!

170
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,080
It's over...

171
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,330
Took you long enough...

172
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,700
<i>At last, Majin Boo has disappeared.</i>

173
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:30,080
<i>He has been completely vaporized,</i>
<i>with literally no cells remaining.</i>

174
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,800
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

175
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:45,390
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

176
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,940
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

177
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,030
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

178
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:09,040
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

179
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,420
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

180
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,300
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

181
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:27,390
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

182
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,890
<i>Even now?</i>

183
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:36,560
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

184
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,940
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

185
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:48,410
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

186
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:58,460
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

187
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,690
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

188
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:20,020
<i>The battle is over, and</i>
<i>we're finally back on earth.</i>

189
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,440
<i>And so is the chubby Boo.</i>

190
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,360
<i>Hold on. Boo, why is it that</i>
<i>just by coming into the city,</i>

191
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,410
<i>there's a big prize-fighting,</i>
<i>robbery-foiling to-do about it?</i>

192
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:30,410
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

193
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,710
<i>"Peace Returns!!</i>
<i>Majin Boo, Champion of Justice!?"</i>

194
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,750
<i>Nice going, Boo-san.</i>

195
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,460
"Next time"
"Peace Returns!!
Majin Boo, Champion of Justice!?"
