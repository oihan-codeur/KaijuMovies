Incredible, Majin Boo!

28
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:42,355
To think how easily you defeated Dabura there!

29
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,945

Yow!

Oh, my! Have you come all the way back here?

Well, well now...!

47
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:12,455
Oh, really? Does it hurt, Kaioshin?

48
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:15,995
Yeah, this is quite the misfortune!

49
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,875
Huh?! Again?!

50
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,805
What's wrong? What's wrong?

51
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:33,765
Are you taking a nap in a place such as this?

52
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:36,685
No one could think you're the one
who stands at the top of the world!

53
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:48,155
It serves you right!

54
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:52,655
I know! How about I strike the final blow?

55
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,465
Are you all right, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?!

56
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:10,215
Damn, and just as it turning out well, too!

57
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:33,325
<i>What kind of guy is this?</i>
<i>I had no effect on him at all!</i>

59
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,455
Gohan-<i>san</i>! Look out!

60
00:10:55,135 --> 00:10:56,395
We can't see him any more!

61
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:59,555
Fly away, to the ends of the universe!

62
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,955
<i>P-Please, be a-alive...</i>

63
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:28,505
Hey! Did you do something just now?!

64
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,915
"Heaven"

65
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:11,135
Those guys... Those guys...

66
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:13,675
Who the hell are they?

67
00:12:25,185 --> 00:12:26,645
I won't have it!

68
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:33,655
I absolutely forbid you to keep
company with this weakling boy!!

69
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:39,785
I've got to calm down!

70
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,165
Come to mention it, how was Videl,

71
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:45,795
who isn't part of that group,
able to fly through the air?

72
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:48,625
Ha! Is that it?!

73
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:51,505
It's so absurd, I'd never
even thought of it before,

74
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:55,515
but maybe humans are naturally able to fly!

75
00:12:55,555 --> 00:12:58,265
Otherwise, there's no reason Videl was able to!

76
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,445
Ahem...

77
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:30,715
If those mysterious guys
are able to so much as fly,

78
00:13:30,755 --> 00:13:32,715
then there's no reason the
world's strongest martial combatant,

79
00:13:32,755 --> 00:13:36,045
Mister Satan, cannot!

80
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:46,765
That's not it, huh? In that case...!

81
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:05,705
Um, we're with the Mister Satan Fan Club...

82
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:08,585
This was nothing, here!

83
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:12,415
See, I was just developing
a new finishing attack, is all...

84
00:14:22,175 --> 00:14:24,595
You had this coming to you, Kaioshin!

85
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:26,605
You've quite thoroughly
been an encumbrance,

86
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:29,725
but I am thankful to you!

87
00:14:29,765 --> 00:14:32,565
After all, thanks to the
people you brought with you,

88
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:36,235
Majin Boo was able to be revived!

89
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:40,445
It's only a feeling of gratitude.

90
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:44,575
I'm going to kill you personally!

91
00:14:44,615 --> 00:14:49,705
I'm sure my papa, who was killed
by you, will be pleased with me too!

92
00:14:57,675 --> 00:14:59,135
Enough of this!

93
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:03,975
Hey, Majin Boo, you can finish off Kaioshin now!

94
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:07,845
Hey, Majin Boo!!

95
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:16,855
I'm hungry. Gonna eat 'im!

96
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,785
That's great! You can eat him, huh?

97
00:15:27,705 --> 00:15:31,125
That means a death worthy of Kaioshin!

98
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:35,125
Okay! Majin Boo, eat up Kaioshin!

99
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:39,585
Gobble him up so that not
even one hair remains of him!

100
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:07,495
Dabura, are you still alive?!

101
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:12,245
And here, you've really
done it to me now, Dabura!

102
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:34,475
That's strange. It was
supposed to be right about here.

103
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:41,775
H-Hey, isn't that it?

104
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:49,575
–All right! Let's descend!
–Yeah!

105
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,125
Goten, let's stop being Super Saiyan.

106
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:00,045
We'll be found out if they sense us!

107
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:00,755
Yeah!

108
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:14,145
Huh? We don't know any of these guys!

109
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:17,435
That's not so! Look!

110
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:19,065
The one who's down over there.

111
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,905
He's that strange guy we saw at the tournament!

112
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:24,365
Oh, you're right!

113
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,945
Has he been finished off?

114
00:17:31,115 --> 00:17:34,455
Say, Trunks-<i>kun</i>, which one is the Majin?

115
00:17:34,495 --> 00:17:36,915
W-Which, you say...

116
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,915
...from here, we're too far away to me to tell!

117
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:43,465
Hey Goten, let's get a little bit closer!

118
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:47,595
B-But–Ah! Wait up, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

119
00:18:14,865 --> 00:18:17,335
Sheesh! I can't tell at all!

120
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:21,835
And where in the world do you suppose
Papa or Gohan and the others went?

121
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,425
Big brother...

122
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:28,845
Say, Trunks-<i>kun...</i>

123
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:30,015
What is it, Goten?

124
00:18:30,055 --> 00:18:32,135
Look over there! See?!

125
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:38,895
What could that be?

126
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:40,395
All right, let's go look!

127
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,095
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

128
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,015
Oh, it's a mannequin?

129
00:19:13,055 --> 00:19:15,435
Ah, it gave me a start!

130
00:19:19,475 --> 00:19:21,895
This is made of stone!

131
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:26,815
But why would there be a mannequin
of Piccolo-<i>san</i> in a place like this?

132
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:42,045
There's also a mannequin
of Kuririn-<i>san</i> over there!

133
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:43,915
This is weird!

134
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:54,925
Y-Yikes!

135
00:19:54,965 --> 00:19:57,805
T-Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

136
00:19:57,845 --> 00:20:00,015
O-Oh, no!

137
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:10,155
Looks as though they didn't notice us!

138
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:20,415
Babidi-<i>sama</i>, he–

139
00:20:20,455 --> 00:20:28,425
Majin Boo is by no means the kind of
guy who will be a loyal follower of yours!

140
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:32,425
At some time... At some time,
he will definitely get out of hand!

141
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:36,975
The day when disaster befalls you will come!

142
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:46,145
Unless we dispose of him now, while
we can, something terrible will happen!

143
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:48,315
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

144
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:50,905
Shut up! Shut up!!

145
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:56,115
How could you do this to
Majin Boo?! My precious Majin Boo!

146
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:59,325
How dare you?! How dare you?!

147
00:20:59,365 --> 00:21:01,325
Babidi-<i>sama</i>!

148
00:21:01,365 --> 00:21:03,375
How dare you?!

149
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:18,175
M-Majin Boo! Are you okay?

150
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:30,185
W-What?!

151
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:34,405
Impossible!

152
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,415
Outstanding! Outstanding!

153
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:47,795
Just what you'd expect of
my papa's creation, Majin Boo!

154
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:57,385
I'm gonna eat you!

155
00:21:57,425 --> 00:22:02,095
<i>Having beaten Kaioshin, as well as Gohan,</i>

156
00:22:02,135 --> 00:22:05,055
<i>with overwhelming strength,</i>
<i>Majin Boo closes in on Dabura.</i>

157
00:22:05,095 --> 00:22:09,355

158

00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:55,945
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

162
00:22:55,985 --> 00:23:02,075
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

163
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:09,085
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

164
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:14,465
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

165
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,295
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

166
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:27,395
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

167
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,935
<i>Even now?</i>

168
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:36,565
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

169
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:41,945
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

170
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:48,455
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

171
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:58,465
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

172
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:16,105
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

173
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:18,605
<i>Dabura has been turned into a cookie?!</i>

174
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:20,905
<i>Hey, can he do that?</i>

175
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:26,075
<i>Ugh! I like eating cookies,</i>
<i>but I don't want to be eaten!</i>

176
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:28,285

<i>Vegeta-san has appeared</i>
<i>from out of the spaceship.</i>

179
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,165
<i>He's going to challenge Boo!</i>
