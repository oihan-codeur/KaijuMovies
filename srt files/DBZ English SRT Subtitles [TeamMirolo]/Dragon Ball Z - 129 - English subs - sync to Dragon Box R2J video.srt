16
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:59,040
<i>The Super Saiyan Son Goku and the</i>
<i>Artificial Human No. 1 9 finally come to blows.</i>

17
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,450
<i>However, there is something</i>
<i>physically wrong with Goku.</i>

18
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,290
<i>What could be happening?</i>

19
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:31,730
I knew it! Father is sick! It's his heart!

20
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,770
What? His heart?!

21
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,110
You mean like that guy
from the future was saying,

22
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,610
a viral infection of his heart?!

23
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,260
<i>"The Might of Vegeta!</i>
<i>The Blood of a Super Saiyan Awakens."</i>

24
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,200
Just a minute. What happens
to me? Am I killed too?

25
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,810
In a short time, you will become very sick.

26
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,910
Soon after, you will pass away.

27
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:52,180
It will be a viral infection of your heart.

28
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,790
Not even a mighty Super Saiyan
can win against this illness.

29
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,860
Oh no, senzu won't have
any effect on the illness either.

30
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,830
Aw, crud!

31
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,800
When your symptoms first appear, take this.

32
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,800
What have you got?

33
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,800
It's medicine for you.

34
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,400
There is no treatment in this era, but
twenty years from now, we have a cure.

35
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,570
That medicine will allow
you to make it through alive.

36
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,810
Gohan, stop kidding around.

37
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,820
That special medicine of his must
have cured his heart virus a long time ago.

38
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,420
Goku's just had his <i>ki</i> sucked
out of him by those guys.

39
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,240
<i>Such pain! What's going on?</i>
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

40
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,800
Goku! Here's a senzu! Take it!

41
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,810
Thank you.

42
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,880
This will see me through.

43
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:08,420
So that's a senzu, capable of healing
great injuries and restoring energy, is it?

44
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,390
Judging by the fact
that he was all but dead,

45
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,270
but is back here among us
now, they must be for real.

46
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,420
The senzu had no effect!

47
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,790
It has to be his heart!

48
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,430
How could it be?

49
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,990
Didn't he take the medicine to cure himself?

50
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,730
He never got sick.

51
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,180
He's been healthy the whole time,
so he never took the medicine!

52
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,480
Father!

53
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Now he's no longer Super Saiyan!

54
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,920
How can this be?

55
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,060
This is bad! Goku's having
his energy drained from him!

56
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,400
You cannot proceed one
centimeter further than this.

57
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,370
Do you want to try it?

58
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,250
I will.

59
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,450
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

60
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,790
So fast! He's unbelievably quick!

61
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,230
I can't call Piccolo's actions just now brave.

62
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,260
He was only being a reckless fool.

63
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,240
At this rate, Son will soon be...

64
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,510
It is my task to defeat Kakarrot.

65
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:48,480
You flea market mannequins
have no place in this.

66
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,120
Vegeta!

67
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,820
Vegeta<i>-san</i>!

68
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,790
Did you say Vegeta?

69
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,320
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

70
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,000
Here I am doing a lousy job acting hurt...

71
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,800
...just so I can save Goku
when they aren't looking...

72
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,370
Then Vegeta, you had to butt
in where you weren't wanted!

73
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,210
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, you mean...

74
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,370
No matter how strong
those guys may say they are,

75
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:22,380
I won't be defeated by
an attack such as that one.

76
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,580
I saw everything.

77
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,380
Even realizing there was
something wrong with yourself,

78
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,890
you went ahead and turned Super Saiyan.

79
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,020
You Idiot!

80
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,050
Doing something like that only assures
the disease will progress that much faster!

81
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,830
My life's goal, no matter how
long it takes, is in you, Kakarrot.

82
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,000
Father!

83
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,210
Stay with us, Father!

84
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,640
Goku!

85
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,380
Are you all right, Son?

86
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,410
Hey, Goku, hang on now!

87
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,390
Someone get Kakarrot out of here,

88
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,420
take him home and give him
that medicine he received back then!

89
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,030
Father! I'm going to take you home now!

90
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,200
No, I'll go.

91
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,560
It's pathetic of me to say so,

92
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,770
but I'm the least use to anyone around here.

93
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,670
This heart disease was said to be viral in nature.

94
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:27,180
It may be contagious, so you should
take a little of that medicine yourself.

95
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,580
Yeah.

96
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,820
Please be careful, Yamucha<i>-san.</i>

97
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,780
So, get going!

98
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,720
Well, everyone, hang in there!

99
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,250
I'll be back, I promise.

100
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,430
Goku! Get better soon!

101
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:52,440
No. 19, let him go!

102
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,410
There's something to be
said for saving the best for last.

103
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,980
Let us take care of these
other annoying insects first.

104
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,420
Now that Vegeta has joined in,
it should prove somewhat entertaining.

105
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,280
Lookie lookie lookie, they call me Yajirobe!

106
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,920
You're much more a family
man than I would have guessed.

107
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,330
Sure. You'd make a good papa for someone.

108
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,730
Up high, up high, up high, up high!

109
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,750
Looks like he's wet himself again.

110
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,580
Okay now, okay now...

111
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,790
Uh oh, I didn't bring
anything else to wrap you up in.

112
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,350
Now what do we do?

113
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:23,590
Now we're stuck. If only there
was something else we could use...

114
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,710
Good, everything's okay now.

115
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,710
You really saved us!

116
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,150
We can always count on you, Yajirobe<i>-kun</i>!

117
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,550
Leave me outta this.

118
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,150
Now then, let's go!

119
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,550
Where to?

120
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,590
Isn't it obvious? After coming this far,

121
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,430
I'm not going home without a good
look at those fearsome Artificial Humans.

122
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,900
Well, I ain't goin'.

123
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,540
Hey, you, how can you just sit
there and silently watch a helpless lady

124
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,900
and her little baby head
off into an area of danger?

125
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:13,140
You don't suppose he's
chicken, do you Trunks<i>-chan</i>?

126
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,380
Well, hurry and get in!

127
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,380
We're just goin' to watch, now.

128
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,920
Soon's we see 'em, we head home, 'kay?

129
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,760
I got it already. Hurry up and get in!

130
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,760
Blast-off!

131
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,420
Hey, Gohan, don't you think it
might be better if we pulled out?

132
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,760
What?

133
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,430
No, seriously. Didn't that boy from
the future tell us this would happen?

134
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,330
Goku would be stricken with a disease,

135
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,340
and all the rest of us, even Vegeta,
would be killed by these Artificial Humans.

136
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,340
Some of the circumstances may have changed,

137
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,240
but isn't everything still just as he warned us?

138
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,750
But if we run now...

139
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:27,620
these guys will destroy the whole Earth,

140
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,320
just like they did that city earlier, I'm sure of it!

141
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,320
I'm saying, just until Goku
recovers from his illness...

142
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,330
There's no reason to still think that
we will all be wiped out, like he said.

143
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,330
Look at how the time of Goku's
predicted sickness was way off, for example.

144
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:48,340
It's likely that his coming here has
generated subtle changes in history.

145
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,770
<i>History has changed?</i>

146
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,580
<i>That doesn't make these</i>
<i>guys any less fearsome, does it?</i>

147
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,350
No. 20...

148
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:02,150
If you please, allow me to finish off Vegeta.

149
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,790
Selfish pest!

150
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,720
After you've already taken
so much energy from Goku,

151
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,200
raising your own absolute power?

152
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,330
Oh, very well.

153
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:19,700
In exchange, I will take
all four remaining others.

154
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,730
Yes.

155
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,360
I've watched all of your little moves up
until now, and I've got you figured out.

156
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,360
You guys aren't the terrible
punks you've been made out to be.

157
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,000
Apparently you draw energy
out through your palms;

158
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,360
that's all I need to watch out for.

159
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,700
You may have been
observing us all this time,

160
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,700
but there's one important
thing you haven't heard yet.

161
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,770
Vegeta, I know everything there is
to know about your own fighting style.

162
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,340
So you say,

163
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,410
but when Goku turned Super Saiyan,
you had a look of surprise on your faces.

164
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,350
In other words,

165
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,790
your data from the time before our fight
with Freeza up until now is mere conjecture.

166
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,120
You can't rely on calculations for understanding.

167
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,600
Not when it comes to the power of us Saiyans.

168
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,790
There's something I want to know.

169
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:24,170
Do even you Artificial
Humans tremble with fear?

170
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,160
What?!

171
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,760
Him too?

172
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,780
V-Vegeta<i>-san</i> also turned into a Super Saiyan!

173
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,330
How can that be? How
could he be a Super Saiyan?

174
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,930
I thought if you didn't
have a calm, still heart,

175
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,370
you couldn't become a Super Saiyan.

176
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,580
My heart was calm and still. Still and pure.

177
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,710
However, it was purely evil.

178
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,720
The only thing I desired was to grow stronger.

179
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,590
I put myself through much fierce training!

180
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,750
Damn...

181
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:36,390
The time came when
I realized I was at my limit.

182
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,460
I'll never surpass Kakarrot like this!

183
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,530
And then, from the anger I felt toward myself,

184
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,730
the Super Saiyan within me suddenly awoke!

185
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,820
I was left shaking from the joy it gave me.

186
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,360
Finally I had overcome Kakarrot,

187
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,160
and the time for me to return
as Prince of the Saiyans had come!

188
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,730
That's enough of your rambling.

189
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,830
You may have changed yourself,

190
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,370
but you are still no match
for us Artificial Humans.

191
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,610
Just like Son Goku before you.

192
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,560
<i>At length, Vegeta has become a Super Saiyan.</i>

193
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,160
<i>Has Vegeta really surpassed Goku?</i>

194
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,320
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

195
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,160
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

196
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,530
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

197
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,030
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

198
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,540
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

199
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,640
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

200
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,150
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

201
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,780
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

202
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,290
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

203
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,390
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

204
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,200
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

205
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,230
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

206
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,910
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

207
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,070
<i>So sorry.</i>

208
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,210
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

209
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,220
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

210
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,770
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

211
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,870
<i>Your power is awesome, Vegeta.</i>

212
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,970
<i>The Artificial Humans don't</i>
<i>stand a chance against you now.</i>

213
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,810
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>Vegeta could be so strong?</i>

214
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,780
<i>He has no vulnerabilities.</i>

215
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,550
<i>It looks like I have no choice</i>
<i>but to return to the laboratory.</i>

216
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,550
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

217
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,250
<i>"No. 20's Defiant Smile...</i>
<i>The Secret of Doctor Gero."</i>

218
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,100
<i>Run now, while you can, No. 20!</i>

219
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,930
"Next time"
"No. 20's Defiant Smile...
The Secret of Doctor Gero"
