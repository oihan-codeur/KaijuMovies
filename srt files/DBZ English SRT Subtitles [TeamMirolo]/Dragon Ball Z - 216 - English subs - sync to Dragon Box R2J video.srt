<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,090
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,630
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:49,020
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,610
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,280
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,530
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,540
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,540

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,110

<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

<i>The Adult Division matches for the</i>
<i>Tenkaichi Tournament have finally begun!</i>

24
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,960
<i>First, Kuririn showed off</i>
<i>his overpowering strength!</i>

25
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,980
<i>However...</i>

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,530
<i>J-Just who is this guy? What is it about him?</i>

27
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,500
You will know soon enough.

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,960
You will know soon enough.

29
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,590
E-Excuse me.

30
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,350
I withdraw.

31
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,060
Withdraw?!

32
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,230
<i>Inconceivably, Piccolo resigns</i>
<i>himself to forfeiting without fighting!</i>

33
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:04,490
<i>Can this mysterious young</i>
<i>man Shin really be that strong?</i>

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,200
<i>And so, contributing even</i>
<i>more to this sense of confusion,</i>

35
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,620
<i>the third match, between Videl</i>
<i>and Spopovitch, is about to begin!</i>

36
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,360
<i>"Undyingly Unpleasant!?</i>
<i>The Mystery of Spopovitch."</i>

37
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:53,370
Videl! Videl! Videl!

38
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,700
<i>How gross!</i>

39
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,290
That guy's really occupied with something...

40
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,510
Videl! Good luck!

41
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,840
Hey, Videl will have an
easy victory against that rat.

42
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,850
Fight! Fight! Lovely Videl!

43
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,850
Whaddya know? Gohan's
girlfriend is unusually popular.

44
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,190
So it seems.

45
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,230
That kid is Gohan's...? How about that?

46
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,530
Gohan must know a thing or two about girls.

47
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,070
Yeah! And besides, I've been
hearin' she's a girl from a rich family,

48
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,620
and Gohan's so good to his Ma.

49
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,910
But she is the only daughter of Mister Satan.

50
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,290
Something like that doesn't matter.

51
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,870
After all, that's a matter
between the two of them.

52
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,810
And so, the third match,

53
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,520
between Contestant Videl
and Contestant Spopovitch!

54
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,360
Please begin!

55
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,760
What is it?

56
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,770
Perhaps I'm mistaken, but m-might you be...

57
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,310
Yes?

58
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:08,480
...m-might you be the Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

59
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,270
No. I am not.

60
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:15,280
He isn't the Grand Kaio.

61
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,410
This is Kaioshin-<i>sama.</i>

62
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,410
K-Kaioshin...?!

63
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,470
Whoa!

64
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,630
Contestant Videl makes a lead-off attack!

65
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,850
Such ferocity! She gives him
absolutely no chance to hit back!

66
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,940
Please keep this to yourself, for now.

67
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,280
I do not wish anyone to know just yet.

68
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,000
K-Kaioshin-<i>sama...</i>

69
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,840
<i>Above the four Kaio-sama</i>
<i>stands the Grand Kaio-sama...</i>

70
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,510
<i>I had heard stories that higher still,</i>

71
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,430
<i>there was a Kami that stood</i>
<i>over the Kaio-sama, but...</i>

72
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,730
<i>No wonder he should have a</i>
<i>dimension so different than ours.</i>

73
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,690
What's the matter, Piccolo?

74
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,530
Did he say something inappropriate to you?

75
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,700
If he did, want me to go over and snap at him?

76
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,990
After all, Piccolo, you did
use to be Kami over the Earth!

77
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,290
S-Stop! Don't say a thing!
Please! Don't say anything! Got it?!

78
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,430
That young man is K-Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?!

79
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,470
I've never even had
the honor of meeting him.

80
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,430
Why would such a figure
go somewhere like Earth?

81
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,480
Oh!

82
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,940
Contestant Spopovitch is down already!
I will begin the count!

83
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:29,370
Contestant Spopovitch
has gotten to his feet!

84
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,870
Looks like he still has plenty
of get-up-and-go left in him!

85
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,770
Spopovitch there sure does
take a blow a lot stronger now.

86
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,440
I guess more than just his
outward appearance has changed.

87
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,860
Yeah.

88
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,820
When I first saw him, I didn't realize it was him.

89
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,470
Contestant Videl lands a terrific attack!

90
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,930
However, Contestant Spopovitch
seems to be bearing it well.

91
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Contestant Spopovitch
is down... no! He's back up!

92
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,760
He's gotten up!

93
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,560
How's that girl doing?

94
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,820
She can go!

95
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,740
Yeah, she has ability completely over his!

96
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,450
Her techniques are landing one after the other.

97
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,200
Hmph, what a low level of fighting...

98
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,580
She's connected once again!

99
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,210
She certainly is a gifted young
lady when it comes to hand-to-hand!

100
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,100
The great man Spopovitch is no match for her!

101
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,810
Nice!

102
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,810
Way to go, Videl!

103
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:01,820
She's doin' pretty good, huh, that girl?

104
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,860
She sure is fit to be Gohan's girlfriend, huh?

105
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,740
You really think so! I do!

106
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,200
We gotta get those two
married now, no matter what!

107
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,870
You gotta be kidding.
That's really Mister Satan's daughter?

108
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,790
So? She's pretty good, isn't she?

109
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,930
No way!

110
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:38,850
Whoa! Contestant Spopovitch once
again rises as if nothing has happened!

111
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,640
What toughness he is displaying!

112
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,820
This proves to be an unexpected development.

113
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,820
Contestant Videl's ferocious
attack does not seem to be registering

114
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,280
any damage on Contestant Spopovitch!

115
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,060
You sure are stubborn!

116
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,870
All right! It's over!

117
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,720
It's decided!

118
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,190
Contestant Videl lands
continuous, terrible attacks!

119
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:53,740
Not even Contestant
Spopovitch can possibly, possib–

120
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,800
H-He's up.

121
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,130
I-Impossible!

122
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,430
She's better off withdrawing from this match.

123
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,140
There's something weird about him.

124
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,810
Withdraw? But Videl's leading him!

125
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:27,940
That's right!

126
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,750
Aah! Videl!

127
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,460
Heh, relax! Videl's just playing around with him.

128
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,050
Snap out of it!

129
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,130
I can't very well let you
become Gohan's bride like that!

130
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:01,470
Looks as though Chichi-<i>san</i> is about
to become the fussy mother-in-law!

131
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,010
Yeah.

132
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,120
Aa! She'll fall!

133
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,330
Oh, no!

134
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,220
She's... stopped.

135
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,980
How's this? Contestant Videl is flying in mid-air!

136
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,900
She has not yet fallen!

137
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,750
W-What?!

138
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,750
What's going on?

139
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,960
Nice going! Nice going!

140
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,080
I taught her how to do that,
the Bukujutsu technique!

141
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,960
She may have been
better off falling out just now.

142
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,140
There's something strange
about that Spopovitch guy.

143
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,010
He should have taken all
that damage up until now,

144
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,220
yet he ain't bothered by it, and
I can't feel any life's <i>ki</i> in him as such.

145
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,480
"Life's <i>ki</i> as such?"What do you mean?

146
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,480
Well, I don't know what it means.

147
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:44,530
What? Videl is about to
get beaten by Spopovitch?!

148
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,280
Y-Yes.

149
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,410
There's some kind of mistake.

150
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:56,460
Spopovitch was defeated by me in
the first round of the last Tournament!

151
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,090
Videl has much greater strength than he does!

152
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:06,050
Well, you see, it appears he has
gotten much better since last time...

153
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,980
She's acting, she's acting! Videl, you rascal,

154
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,560
you've learned from me, trying to
stir up this Tournament, aren't you?!

155
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,110
Are you sure that's it?

156
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:21,400
That has to be it!

157
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,610
Contestant Spopovitch's neck has been broken!

158
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,160
She's done him in!

159
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,250
Whoa! She killed him!

160
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,220
You mustn't look!

161
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:46,490
L-Ladies and gentlemen,
this is a most tragic conclusion.

162
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,990
According to the rules of this Tournament,
as Contestant Videl has killed her opponent,

163
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,450
she is disqualif–

164
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,500
W-W-W–

165
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,710
What's this?!

166
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,040
His neck has returned to normal!
How can this possibly be?!

167
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,220
W-What is this?

168
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,130
Goku is right. She'd better concede!

169
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,470
There's definitely something
irregular about that punk!

170
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,310
Oh! Contestant Videl is flying again!

171
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,690
Yeah! That's good!

172
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,570
Escape up into the air for a bit
to recover some of your energy!

173
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,290
H-He's flying!

174
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,460
It can't be!

175
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,840
<i>Spopovitch can fly through the air too?</i>

176
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,510
<i>What is the secret of this man's strength?</i>

177
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,390
<i>Moreover, how will the</i>
<i>now-cornered Videl fight against him?</i>

178
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,870
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

179
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,540
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

180
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,220
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

181
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:02,270
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

182
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:09,270
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

183
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,610
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

184
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,490
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

185
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:27,540
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

186
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,170
<i>Even now?</i>

187
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:36,680
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

188
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,220
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

189
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:48,600
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

190
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:58,650
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

191
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,920
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

192
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,050
<i>That Spopovitch guy is brutal.</i>

193
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,180
<i>He's a real monster, going</i>
<i>that far against a female opponent.</i>

194
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,390
<i>H-Hey, Gohan! What are</i>
<i>you turning Super Saiyan for?!</i>

195
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,310
<i>Don't tell me you're going</i>
<i>to go save her in that getup!</i>

196
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,150
<i>That's a bad idea!</i>

197
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,150
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

198
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,480
<i>"A Tragic Videl!!</i>
<i>Are You Coming Out, Angry Super Gohan?"</i>

199
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,280
<i>You'll pay for this, Spopovitch!</i>

200
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,820
"Next time"
"A Tragic Videl!!
Are You Coming Out, Angry Super Gohan?"
