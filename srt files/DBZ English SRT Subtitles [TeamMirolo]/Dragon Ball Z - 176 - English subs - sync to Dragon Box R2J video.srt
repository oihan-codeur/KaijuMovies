00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,900

16
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:57,040
<i>The hour of the fated</i>
<i>Cell Games had finally arrived.</i>

17
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,810
Okay then, let's make
contemptuous faces at him! Nyaah!

18
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,600
And I'll give him a good spanky-spanky!

19
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,520
Welcome, all of you!

20
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,060
How about that?!

21
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,570
It's time!

22
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,830
<i>"Just a Moment!!</i>
<i>The Satan Squad Goes On the Rampage."</i>

23
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,320
Whoever goes first is fine with me.

24
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,530
Of course, that will be me.
It's only natural I'd be the one.

25
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,530
Don't do it, Goku.

26
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,830
These guys just won't understand,
even if you do tell them.

27
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,660
I can't let that happen.

28
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,620
You're gonna get killed!
Trust me on this, give it up!

29
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,880
Hey, cameraman, get a
shot of that dimwit over there.

30
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,760
Right.

31
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,640
It's almost as if I can hear the
voices of all the world in my ears,

32
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,520
saying "Oh, my word!"

33
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,900
Does this man realize what
he just said to Mister Satan?!

34
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,780
Of all the things to say at this moment,

35
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,910
"You're gonna get killed!
Trust me on this, give it up!"

36
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,320
That's what he said!

37
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
It's because of things like this

38
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,920
that ignorant bumpkins are an
embarrassment to the rest of us!

39
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,510
After all of our explaining who
Satan is, he still doesn't get it!

40
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,260
There's no helping those kinds of folks, huh?

41
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,390
He looks like him...

42
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,560
That man looks like him...

43
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:08,480
That child, who once upon a time,
saved us all from Piccolo Daimao...

44
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,870
However, he didn't have
the same eye or hair color.

45
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,920
It must be someone else...

46
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:28,920
Be that as it may, it's this man that concerns me.

47
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,930
N-No matter how I look at him,

48
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,350
I can't help but think that
he is that same Piccolo Daimao...

49
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,480
Look, it's all right, just let
those idiots do as they like.

50
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,770
Even if they are killed,

51
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,190
they can be brought back
to life with the Dragon Balls.

52
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,940
Ah, well, I guess there ain't much choice, huh?

53
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:50,860
Oh, it appears that he
has finally been convinced!

54
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,070
Which is to say, it's only natural.

55
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,280
Could he have realized
that his life has been spared?

56
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,290
They finally understand, huh?

57
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,920
This nonsensical group has been
nothing but an annoyance to Mister Satan!

58
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,210
As we pull ourselves together, the
match can finally continue once again!

59
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,630
Please wait, Sensei!

60
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,350
W-What's this?

61
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,710
A mysterious group of people
has appeared before Mister Satan!

62
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,500
Who in the world could they be?!

63
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,670
We've got more weirdoes showing up!

64
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,670
We are Mister Satan's finest pupils!

65
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,560
The world's most gorgeous
man, Caroni, the Swift!

66
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,110
The world's most staggeringly
strong man, Piroshiki the Mighty!

67
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,950
A-Apparently, these two are
acquaintances of Mister Satan.

68
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:26,540
Allow me to explain.

69
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,920
These two men are Mister Satan's
first and second pupils,

70
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,920
and are the next-to-greatest,
and next-to-next-to greatest warriors,

71
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,510
compared to the warrior who
boasts the greatest speed and power.

72
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,930
Oh, that is incredible!

73
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,020
And I am their beautiful manager, Pizza.

74
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,100
Sensei, there is no need for
you to get your own hands dirty

75
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,860
against such a rank amateur.

76
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,530
W-We can easily defeat him!

77
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,950
Hmm, perhaps so.

78
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,950
It might be a bit childish of me
to take on such a rank amateur myself.

79
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,040
I leave him to you!

80
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,500
People of the world, did you hear that?!

81
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,840
Mister Satan has clearly announced

82
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,380
that these two top pupils of
his will defeat Cell in his place!

83
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,640
And what promising
assistants they appear to be!

84
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,470
Our victory is now all the more assured!

85
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,780
Caroni and Piroshiki!

86
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,150
I've seen their pictures in magazines!

87
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,950
They're Satan's favorite pupils,

88
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,370
and have won a great
deal of fighting tournaments!

89
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,280
That's awesome!

90
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,950
<i>Idiots...!</i>

91
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,670
There's more of them now... those fools.

92
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,460
And so, the Cell Games resume!

93
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,960
First up is Mister Satan's top pupil,
Contestant Caroni the Swift!

94
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,180
And so, I, Caroni, will be your opponent.

95
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,640
Very good. Mmm, sweet...!

96
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,170
These are a parting gift for you,
as you are about to enter the ground.

97
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,750
–Caroni-<i>sama</i>!
–He's so cool!

98
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,920
Magnificent!

99
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,350
What a graceful, elegant,
yet bewitching technique!

100
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,140
Allow me to explain.

101
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,730
He is a master of the aerial death strike,

102
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,560
and can even snatch a
swallow as it flies through the air.

103
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,940
That is incredible!

104
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,570
As one might expect of Satan's top pupil,

105
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,240
his abilities are in a league of their own!

106
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,650
What's the deal with this guy?

107
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,740
That move must have floored
100,000 of my female fans.

108
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,630
And so, the Cell Games, with
the fate of the world in the balance,

109
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,460
have now begun!

110
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,130
The rules are simple:

111
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,920
if you fall outside of this ring, you lose;

112
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,380
if you give up, you lose;
and if you die, you lose!

113
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,560
Are you afraid?

114
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,680
Not to worry, the suffering
will only last a moment.

115
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,520
Beautiful... Rose... Flying...

116
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,270
Attack!!

117
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,860
Oh, my! What a super jump!

118
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,950
This is Caroni's greatest, most
inscrutable finishing technique!

119
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,820
This match has already seen its conclusion.

120
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,830
"Big Finish" time...

121
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,260
Incredible! He's still flying up!

122
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,810
I-Is he still flying up...?

123
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,690
He must be in superb shape.

124
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,360
W-What could that sound be?

125
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,500
W-What could have happened, exactly?

126
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,800
S-Surely, he must have jumped too high.

127
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,930
He's good at doing this, but he has
a bad habit of getting carried away.

128
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,940
Therein lies the reason
why he cannot surpass me.

129
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,350
That's correct!

130
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,270
I see!

131
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,380
–What happened?
–My Caroni-<i>sama</i>!
–Stupid jerk!

132
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,720
As luck would have it, Contestant
Caroni the Swift has lost by Ringout,

133
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,140
and though a gifted warrior,
he meets with valorous defeat.

134
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,350
Truly, this is a shame!

135
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,730
I-I will defeat Cell!

136
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,030
Allow me to explain.

137
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,500
His monstrous strength
rivals that of 20 elephants,

138
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,710
and he can flatten a bull with one blow.

139
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,250
T-That does indeed sound fierce.

140
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,470
F-Fantastic! What fantastic power!

141
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,860
W-What colossal strength!

142
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,270
Cell does not stand a chance against him!

143
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,360
They're on two completely different levels!

144
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,530
Knowing Piroshiki, he won't make
the same kind of blunder as Caroni did.

145
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,700
You have to feel sorry for Cell.

146
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,480
Oh, my! Contestant Piroshiki
has begun a ferocious dash!

147
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:12,360
This is Contestant Piroshiki's
Megaton Bull Crusher!

148
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,700
At this point, there's no one that can stop him!

149
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:36,510
What could have happened?

150
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,640
Contestant Piroshiki's motion has stopped!

151
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I-I give up!

152
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,550
What in the world just
happened? Mister Satan...?

153
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,090
It's a trick.

154
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,560
He is considerably afraid of me, you see.

155
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,350
He has set up tricks all around
the dueling ring. Damned bastard...!

156
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,690
It's possible that he has soaked his entire body

157
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,520
with the smell of green peppers,
which Piroshiki despises,

158
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,780
or he might have rigged
nails to stick up out of the floor.

159
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,370
But I will expose his tricks!

160
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:45,540
So that's it! I don't know when
he might have done it, though...

161
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,880
What a dirty trick to use in a one-on-one fight!

162
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,340
I'm telling you, that's not it!

163
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,170
Those two were tossed around by Cell's <i>ki.</i>

164
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,840
Figure it out already, would you?

165
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,350
And so, having had his
beloved pupils beaten by foul play,

166
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,520
Mister Satan gathers his fury
and once again enters the ring!

167
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,730
He removes his cape...

168
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,530
...and now, he has removed
his glorious champion belt!

169
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,950
And so, our hero, Mister
Satan, has taken the stage!

170
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,950
This match will determine the fate of the Earth!

171
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,370
Our world combat sport champion Mister Satan

172
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,670
has gleefully commented to us that
he has been looking forward to this day!

173
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,510
Oh? Mister Satan has pulled
something from out of his breast pocket.

174
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,050
It's a capsule! He has pulled out a capsule...

175
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,270
Oh, it's his bag! An enormous
bag has come forth from the capsule!

176
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,940
Now then, what could be inside the bag?

177
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,530
Roofing tiles!

178
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,370
There were roofing tiles inside!

179
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,540
Mister Satan is delicately stacking the tiles!

180
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,370
Oh, man...!

181
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,540
Hey now, you don't suppose he's...?

182
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:17,880
The stack numbers... 15 tiles! 15 tiles!

183
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,050
He has taken 15 roofing
tiles and stacked them high!

184
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,900
And now, he's focusing his mind!

185
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,530
Mister Satan is concentrating his power!

186
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,860
Let's remain quiet for this now...

187
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:13,520
Oh, my! Only one remains!

188
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,650
Still, this is incredible!
What terrific destructive force!

189
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:21,070
14 tiles! 14 tiles have been shattered to pieces!

190
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,850
He's a genuine idiot.

191
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,810
Cell! Take a look at these tiles
that have been smashed to pieces!

192
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:02,780
In one more minute... this is how you will look.

193
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:13,580
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

194
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,250
I've just gone numb! Such is the world's Satan!

195
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,510
I have just been intensely moved!

196
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,430
<i>I nailed it! I absolutely nailed it just now!</i>

197
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,930
<i>It's a good thing I'm taping</i>
<i>this on my video recorder.</i>

198
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,060
He's losing his nerve!

199
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,940
Even Cell, with all of his big talk,
can't help but lose his nerve

200
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,150
after seeing the destructive
force of Mister Satan!

201
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,320
However, it's too late
for him to make apologies!

202
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,530
The people of the world
will not forgive Cell's crimes!

203
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,660
All right, come on!

204
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,790
And so, Mister Satan takes up
a completely combative stance!

205
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,630
The world's number one
combat sport warrior by far,

206
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,340
Mister Satan, versus Cell!

207
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,260
The iron fist of justice
is about to burst upon Cell,

208
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,840
who has taken so many human lives!

209
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,680
Satan! Satan! Satan!

210
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,850
Come on, Mister Satan!

211
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,100
If possible, we'd like for
you to beat Cell by killing him!

212
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,950
Ah, there he goes!

213
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,790
Contestant Satan immediately
launches into some grand techniques!

214
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:36,120
His Dynamite Kick has erupted against Cell!

215
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,910
Has this match already been decided?!

216
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,340
Contestant Satan does
not let up with his attack!

217
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,970
He's raining blows upon him!
He's raining blows upon Cell!

218
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,810
Cell is helpless to defend himself!
He's strong! He's more than strong!

219
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,770
Such is our champion, Mister Satan!

220
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,530
Hey, now to finish you!

221
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,190
Stop pestering me!

222
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,070
"Conk!"

223
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,040
Huh...?

224
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,960
In all honesty, I was kind
of rooting for Cell just now.

225
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,430
Geez, he's still alive?

226
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:36,850
It looks like even Cell is
averse to killing that sort.

227
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:55,570
H-He fell outside of the ring...
U-Um... Contestant Satan has lost...

228
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,670
Now then, let's hurry and
get the Cell Games started!

229
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,380
Who will go first?

230
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,790
As expected, will you, Son Goku, lead off?

231
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,760
Yeah, that's right.

232
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,980
<i>At last, Goku and Cell face each other.</i>

233
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:30,690
<i>The curtain now rises on the true</i>
<i>Cell Games, the ultimate decisive battle!</i>

234
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,340
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

235
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:55,180
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

236
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,510
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

237
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:06,020
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

238
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,570
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

239
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:16,660
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

240
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,160
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

241
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,790
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

242
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:30,290
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

243
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,420
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

244
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,220
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

245
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,260
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

246
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,940
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

247
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,100
<i>So sorry.</i>

248
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:53,230
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

249
00:23:55,990 --> 00:24:01,240
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

250
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,300
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

251
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,130
<i>Cell is even more awesome than I thought.</i>

252
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,220
<i>If I get even the slightest bit</i>
<i>careless, I'll be finished off!</i>

253
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,140
<i>I was hoping to save</i>
<i>the most enjoyable for last.</i>

254
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,270
<i>Well, bring it on, Son Goku!</i>

255
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,350
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

256
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,770
<i>"Fight Time, Goku!!</i>
<i>The Ultra-Tense Cell Games."</i>

257
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:37,070
<i>Father's ki is rising.</i>
<i>He's planning to fight at full power!</i>

258
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,280
"Next time"
"Fight Time, Goku!!
The Ultra-Tense Cell Games"
