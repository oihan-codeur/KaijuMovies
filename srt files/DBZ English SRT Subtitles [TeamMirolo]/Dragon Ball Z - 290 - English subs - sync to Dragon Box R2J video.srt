<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,460
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,210
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,840
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,100
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,860
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,750
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,750
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,420
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,760
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,770
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,140
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:34,360
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,190
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,990

23
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,250
<i>Ten years' time had passed</i>
<i>since Majin Boo was defeated</i>

24
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,340
<i>by the power of Goku, and of all mankind.</i>

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,220
Grandpa, I flew around the Earth!

26
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:15,810
<i>Goku, together with Goten, as well</i>
<i>as Gohan and Videl's daughter, Pan,</i>

27
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:22,240
<i>decided to enter the Tenkaichi</i>
<i>Tournament, after a long absence.</i>

28
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,660
Why, all of a sudden, have you
decided to enter this time in particular?

29
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,200
Because there's going to be
somebody strong entering too.

30
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,620
What's this?

31
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,660
I can more or less tell.
This guy is definitely strong!

32
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,960
<i>"I Am Oob!</i>
<i>Now 10 Years Old, the Former Majin!?"</i>

33
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,710
Good luck!

34
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,140
<i>A-Awesome... I've never seen so many people...</i>

35
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,220
Hey!

36
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,720
What's with you?

37
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,560
S-Sorry!

38
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,730
Geez, you're nervous!

39
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:43,150
Still, a kid like you is lucky to
have gotten past the preliminaries.

40
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,740
I'm sure it was just luck.

41
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,450
Of course it was! Every year, there's
always one lucky guy that gets in.

42
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:56,870
Well, this year, there's another,
super-lucky one as well.

43
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,310
Yow-ow-ow...!

44
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,730
Hey!

45
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,570
That hurt, you know! You runt!

46
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,160
Have you got something against me?

47
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:38,830
Well? Why don't you say
something? You runt!

48
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,420
Grandpa!

49
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,730
There, there! Don't cry, don't cry, Pan.

50
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,560
Now then, sorry to keep you waiting!

51
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,400
We would now like to begin the drawings

52
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,740
to determine the matches
for the Tenkaichi Tournament!

53
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,820
Ladies and gentlemen,
as I believe you already know,

54
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,580
these matches are
carried out tournament-style,

55
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,700
with the contestants who
have passed the preliminaries!

56
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,540
The pairings for the tournament
are impartially decided by this lottery.

57
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,130
Further, the one contestant that
wins their way through the tournament...

58
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:32,550
...will compete for victory against
the Super Champion, Mister Satan!

59
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:37,560
Hey, is that incredible guy that Goku-<i>san</i>
was talking about really among us?

60
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,470
Beats me.

61
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,730
W-Well, there sure are
some weird bastards, anyhow.

62
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,070
Tell me, Kakarrot, which one is he?

63
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,490
You'll see.

64
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,660
So then, contestants, when I call
your name, please draw your number!

65
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,120
Let's see, first up is Son Goten-<i>san</i>!

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,540
Right!

67
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,130
This way, if you please!

68
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,540
Say, Boo...

69
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,720
Can you be sneaky and change
the numbers with your magic for me?

70
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,430
When Mister Satan was still drawing numbers,

71
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,140
he asked you to cheat for
him, right? Now I'm asking.

72
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,560
I get it. Fine.

73
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,730
What is it you're planning?
What are you thinking?

74
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,940
Sorry, but no matter what,
I want to fight with him.

75
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,780
Both him and me, in the first round,
while we're both at 100 percent strength.

76
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,740
Here.

77
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,540
Number 8! Son Goten-<i>san</i> is number 8!

78
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,410
Let's see, next comes Mo Kekko-<i>san.</i>

79
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,630
A pretty strong-looking
guy has come forward, huh?

80
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,630
That guy is all looks.
There's no substance to him.

81
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,640
That may be so from
where you're looking, I suppose.

82
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,600
Why didn't you enter?

83
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,140
You knew that there was going to be this
level of guys here from the start, didn't you?

84
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,730
If you had finished, we could have gotten
some prize money, you know, prize money.

85
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:09,650
Don't be crazy! Never mind the others,
with Goku and them as my opponents,

86
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,730
there's no way I could win, is there?

87
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:16,740
I won, ten years ago. I did let
Mister Satan have the victory, though.

88
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,820
But that was because of
the commotion around Boo,

89
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,580
when Goku and the others dropped out.

90
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,540
You really don't have any guts, huh?

91
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,710
Come on, would you...?

92
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,750
Mama, next is Pan-<i>chan</i>'s turn!

93
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,720
Which one should I choose?

94
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,550
Hey, is it still okay not to use any magic?

95
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,140
Mm-hmm, it's still all right.

96
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,560
Let's see, this one!

97
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,150
Right! Number one!

98
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,060
Contestant Pan is number one!

99
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:56,150
Oh! Pan-<i>chan</i> is number one, huh?
Which means, her opponent is...

100
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,660
"Mo Kekko"

101
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,750
W-What's this?! Of all people,
it's that ferocious guy?!

102
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,660
Number one, number one, number one...

103
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,710
Okay, next is Son Goku-<i>san</i>! If you would...!

104
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,720
I've been waiting for this!

105
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,550
Which one is open...?

106
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,720
All right! Boo, number three, please!

107
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,560
Gotcha.

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,560
Yo!

109
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,810
It has been some time. Son-<i>san,</i>

110
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,150
we've missed you in the tournaments
that you haven't been here for.

111
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,160
Right, Son Goku-<i>san</i> is number three!

112
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,410
Let's see, next comes Kirano-<i>san</i>!

113
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,670
Right.

114
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,140
Give him... let's see... let him have number six.

115
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,720
Gotcha.

116
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,980
What? He's not the one?

117
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,740
Number six! Kirano-<i>san</i> is number six!

118
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,160
Okay, now then, Oob-<i>kun</i>!

119
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,710
R-Right!

120
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,830
Boo, number four! Give that boy number four!

121
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,710
After this, you don't need to cheat any more.

122
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,130
Okey-dokey.

123
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,550
W-What, now?

124
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,130
Don't tell me... it's that kid?!

125
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,340
Yeah, it's him.

126
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,810
While training alone,
I've been waiting a long time

127
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,470
for that boy to enter the tournament.

128
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,060
I'm not understanding
this at all. Talk to me, already!

129
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:00,070
Ten years ago, when that unbelievably
evil Boo died, I asked for a favor.

130
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,490
I asked that he be reincarnated
as a good guy this time,

131
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,660
so that we could go one-on-one.

132
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:10,080
Apparently, Old Man King Yama
heard me, and took it under consideration.

133
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,040
Y-You're telling me that
kid there is his reincarnation?!

134
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,630
Mm-hmm, no doubt about it.
For some reason, I can tell.

135
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,180
Even his name, see? It's "Oob," right?

136
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,640
If you read that backwards, it's "Boo," ain't it?

137
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,470
Right? That's a strange coincidence, huh?

138
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,060
C-Can it be?

139
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,810
H-He's what?!

140
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,190
<i>M-Maybe Mom was right after all.</i>

141
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,650
<i>Even if I am the strongest in the</i>
<i>village, the world is a big place.</i>

142
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:50,200
<i>There's sure to be very strong people out</i>
<i>here, lots of people who are stronger than me.</i>

143
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,050
<i>W-What should I do?</i>
<i>I told her I would definitely win.</i>

144
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,680
<i>I promised everyone that I would use</i>
<i>the prize money to buy lots of things to eat,</i>

145
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,680
<i>and bring them back.</i>

146
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,690
<i>Son Goku-san, huh?</i>

147
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,840
The pairings for the first
round have been decided!

148
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,010
In the first match, Contestant
Pan versus Contestant Mo Kekko.

149
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,640
In the second match, Contestant
Son Goku versus Contestant Oob.

150
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,150
In the third match, Contestant Captain
Chicken versus Contestant Kirano.

151
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,730
In the fourth match, Contestant Mister
Boo versus Contestant Son Goten.

152
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,570
In the fifth match, Contestant
Trunks versus Contestant Otokosuki.

153
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,200
And in the sixth match, Contestant
Knock versus Contestant Vegeta!

154
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,720
The matches will begin right away, so when
your names are called, please come to the ring.

155
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,970
Until then, you are free
to rest or begin warming up.

156
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:34,510
Very well then, we'll see you afterwards.

157
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,560
That's not fair, having to go
against Boo-<i>san</i> in the first round!

158
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,730
You're just lucky when it
comes to lotteries, huh Goten?

159
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,730
You're only in trouble because
you're always skipping your training.

160
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,740
I'm the one who should be upset!

161
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,080
I've got this kid for an opponent!

162
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,080
I didn't come here to play around in
some nursery school, you little turd!

163
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,920
How did someone like her
get through the preliminaries?

164
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:09,130
Go home and suck your mama's
milk now, while you still can!

165
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,140
Thank goodness! You're just
what I like in an opponent!

166
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,720
I'll be sure to let you
have it as hard as I can!

167
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,560
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, you're lucky when
it comes to lotteries too, huh?

168
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,690
Hey, pops. Hey, you! I'm talking to you!

169
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:28,690
What are you ignoring
me for, you old piece of crap!

170
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,160
I was just going to pay my respects
as your opponent in the match.

171
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,320
Die!

172
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,460
Someone tell them that
somebody has dropped out.

173
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,560
Geez, Vegeta, for the love of...!

174
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,730
Papa is strong!

175
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,860
We're terribly sorry for the delay!

176
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,150
We now at last begin the final
competition for the Tenkaichi Tournament!

177
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,490
Of the 114 participants in this tournament,

178
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,750
we have selected the finest
twelve to fight for the prize money,

179
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,580
and for the right to challenge the champion!

180
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:31,130
Once again, the prize money is
being sponsored by Mister Satan!

181
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:41,180
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

182
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,490
Hang tough, okay?

183
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,950
Your Papa and Mama will be
cheering for you from the second floor.

184
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,170
Don't get nervous. Relax, relax.

185
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,550
Now then, right off,
let's begin the first match!

186
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,710
Okay, come back soon!

187
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,010
I'll be right back!

188
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:31,570
The first match is between
Contestant Pan and Contestant Mo Kekko!

189
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,440
Contestant Pan is–won't
you be surprised to hear this–

190
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,570
a gifted little girl, who is only four years old!

191
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,580
However, as if that weren't enough, amazingly...

192
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,450
...she is also Mister Satan's granddaughter!

193
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,050
She faces Contestant Mo Kekko, who
was unfortunate enough to be defeated...

194
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,460
...by Contestant Mister Boo in the
semifinals at the last tournament.

195
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,760
He is a powerful contender,
standing two meters, 30 centimeters!

196
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,150
How cute! Good luck!

197
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,690
Don't you pick on her, Mo!

198
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:17,570
She's Satan's granddaughter, then?

199
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,120
E-Even so, that doesn't change the fact
that this is making a laughingstock of me!

200
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Damn it all!

201
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,790
Still, how did that little squirt
get through the preliminaries?

202
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:29,170
Even if she is Mister Satan's granddaughter...

203
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,380
Beats me. Well, she could have
cheated her way though, right?

204
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,630
I hope you're all right, Pan-<i>chan.</i>

205
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,720
Hang in there, Pan-<i>chan</i>!

206
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,720
Pan! Don't go too far out there!

207
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,390
Pan-<i>chan</i>, good luck!

208
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:16,210
Very well then, please begin!

209
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,970
What choice do I have? I'll toss her out.

210
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,770
What?!

211
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,200
She did it!

212
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,890
Well, he's all right!
Contestant Mo is still breathing!

213
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,890
He is not dead, so Contestant
Pan wins the first match!

214
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,740
You did it!

215
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,150
Way to go, Pan-<i>chan</i>!

216
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,750
A-Are you okay?!

217
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,750
Pan-<i>chan</i>!

218
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,750
You're not hurt?

219
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,750
Mm-mm, I'm all right!

220
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,130
There's no reason she shouldn't be, right?

221
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,470
That was really something to see, Pan.

222
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,640
We're next, huh?

223
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,730
Let's give it our best!

224
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,190
R-Right! Please accept my regards!

225
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,620
Now then, the second match will be

226
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,160
between Contestant Son
Goku and Contestant Oob!

227
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,170
Contestant Son Goku has previously
appeared in the tournament several times,

228
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,840
and incredibly, as a
martial artist of super ability,

229
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,590
he even has the experience
of being victorious once!

230
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,720
I personally expect his abilities to place him

231
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,140
among the top class of
contestants in this tournament!

232
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,930
I anticipate a white-hot match

233
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,140
between him and Mister Satan's
number-one pupil, Mister Boo!

234
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,890
Facing him is Contestant Oob,

235
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,560
a young boy who has come all the
way from his village on South Island!

236
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,770
The oldest of five, he is a hard worker,

237
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,150
who often looks after his
younger brothers and sisters!

238
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,360
He absolutely wants the prize money,

239
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,570
and has bravely gone
ahead to enter this time around.

240
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,660
Give him all you've got, kid!

241
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,080
Hang in there! Your big sister
will be cheering for you, here!

242
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,880
Oh, I feel so sorry for him.
For him to have come all this way,

243
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,090
just to have Son-<i>kun</i> be his opponent...

244
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,510
This will be the fight of
greatest notice this time around.

245
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,050
Indeed it will.

246
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,560
So then, please begin the match!

247
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:35,080
Don't be so nervous! You can't put
out what you're capable of like that!

248
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,500
R-Right!

249
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,790
This isn't going to work.

250
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:50,970
<i>It's no use. All right, if it comes to that...</i>

251
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:55,970
Hey there, you! Come at me! You little hick!

252
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,310
Earlier, you were pretending in
front of everyone to be a good little boy,

253
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,480
but you're really an
incredible brat, ain't you?

254
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,070
And I... let's see... I hate you!
I'm going to knock you flying!

255
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:13,490
Or would you rather, um, get killed,
and go back home as a pile of bones?!

256
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:18,080
Let's see, let's see...
Your mommy's belly-button sticks out!

257
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,500
M-My mommy's
belly-button does not stick out!

258
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,090
Well then, she's just a pile of poo!

259
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,260
Yeah! Yeah! She's a pile of poo!

260
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,470
What are they up to?
All they're doing is talking out there.

261
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,930
Search me.

262
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,640
<i>All right, now for the final blow!</i>

263
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,060
Your daddy...

264
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,060
...is a pile of poo, too!

265
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,590
Neither my father...

266
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,760
...nor my mother...

267
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,380
...are piles of poo!!

268
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,150
<i>At last, Oob snaps. What is the</i>
<i>reincarnated Majin Boo capable of?</i>

269
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,730
<i>The second round that Goku</i>
<i>promised Majin Boo is about to begin!</i>

270
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,910
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

271
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,500
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

272
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,090
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

273
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,180
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

274
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:09,190
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

275
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,570
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

276
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,450
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

277
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:27,500
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

278
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,040
<i>Even now?</i>

279
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,680
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

280
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,100
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

281
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:48,560
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

282
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:58,610
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

283
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,380
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

284
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,050
<i>Oob, you're as awesome as I thought, all right.</i>

285
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:21,930
<i>You wanna come train with me?</i>

286
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,970
<i>Son-kun, what are you thinking,</i>

287
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,440
<i>suddenly ditching the match and flying away?</i>

288
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,020
<i>Next time on the final episode of Dragon Ball Z,</i>

289
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:33,070
<i>"Even Stronger!!</i>
<i>Goku's Dream is Super-Huge."</i>

290
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,730
<i>Father sure does seem happy.</i>

291
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,700
"Next time"
"Even Stronger!!
Goku's Dream is Super-Huge"
