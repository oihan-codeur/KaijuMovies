<i>Sparking!</i>

15
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,240
<i>Goku's spaceship was</i>
<i>racing toward Planet Namek.</i>

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,750
<i>Piccolo, Tenshinhan and the others</i>

18
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,700
<i>Elsewhere, a fierce battle between</i>
<i>Vegeta, burning with ambition,</i>

19
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,670
<i>and the evil minion Zarbon, was unfolding.</i>

20
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,840
Ha! To think that you'd
be so helpless at <i>this</i> level!

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,670
You've surprised me. You have
indeed made magnificent progress.

22
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,740
But as a result, you have
awakened my true power,

23
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,220
which has been dormant for many years.

24
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:53,790
<i>"Nothing but Goosebumps! The Handsome</i>
<i>Warrior Zarbon's Devilish Transformation."</i>

25
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,910
What?

26
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,590
You say I've awakened your true power,
which has been dormant for many years?

27
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,760
That's correct.

28
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,800
That's a hilarious joke!

29
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,610
I will tell you why I have let my true
power lie dormant and unused before you die.

30
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,550
In order to display my true
power, I must transform myself.

31
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,580
However, my transformed
appearance is unattractive.

32
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,590
As someone who prefers
beauty, I cannot abide it.

33
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,160
But I will choose to
transform before I choose death.

34
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,330
Transform, you say? The way we Saiyans do?

35
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,010
Those who are cornered will say the
most absurd things out of desperation.

36
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,700
Unlike a Saiyan, I do not transform
into something larger than is needed.

37
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,210
My power just increases.

38
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,150
Overwhelmingly so!

39
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,790
Show me!

40
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,630
You need not ask.

41
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:42,570
I will show it to you, now!

42
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,180
W-What is this?!

43
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,610
My appearance isn't the
only thing that has transformed!

44
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,250
Don't be too terrified by my power!

45
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,740
Dende, aren't we to the Grand Elder's place yet?

46
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,580
It's a little bit farther ahead.

47
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,110
We have to do something while
Vegeta and that other guy are fighting.

48
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,390
You know, I get the feeling
that a lot of time has passed

49
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,760
since we landed on this planet,

50
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,590
but it doesn't look like the sun is
setting one bit, huh? Why is that?

51
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,700
The sun doesn't go down.

52
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,570
After all, we have three suns,
and they all come out in turn.

53
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,710
Then, you don't have night on your world?

54
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,920
No, we don't.

55
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,290
Well, okay...

56
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,510
<i>D-Dammit!</i>

57
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,260
That's my limit...
I've got to have a little rest...

58
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,870
Still, I've conquered this fifty-times
gravity a lot faster than I thought I would.

59
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,650
Looks like that duel with
Vegeta wasn't altogether useless.

60
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,090
I wonder if Tenshinhan and those
guys are training under Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

61
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:52,880
<i>Listen to me, Goku. This is an order from Kaio.</i>

62
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,050
<i>Do not go near him.</i>

63
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,890
<i>I'm not just saying this for your own sake.</i>

64
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,960
<i>I'm saying this for the sake</i>
<i>of everyone on Earth, Namek,</i>

65
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,060
<i>and many other planets as well.</i>

66
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,990
<i>If you launch some shoddy</i>
<i>attack on Freeza and get him angry,</i>

67
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,070
<i>something terrible is going to happen.</i>

68
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,010
<i>You have to leave that guy alone.</i>

69
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,650
I can't go resting now! All right!

70
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,040
Hold it!

71
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,500
Hold it!

72
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,100
Hold it! Hold it!

73
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,200
Hold it!

74
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,640
"Rice catch!" Get it? That was a great pun!

75
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:05,050
Hold it!

76
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,060
Dammit, I'm not about to lose!

77
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,950
No matter how you might
struggle, you cannot beat me!

78
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,740
Incredible! Even as far away as we
are, I can feel the <i>ki</i> from their battle.

79
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,910
My power now doesn't even compare
to what it was before I transformed!

80
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,090
<i>I-It's no good...</i>
<i>Even after I powered up on Earth...</i>

81
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,940
I'm not going to let you die easy!

82
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,070
Vegeta, is that all for you?

83
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,880
You're not showing yourself, huh?

84
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,090
Looks like you weren't able to
move, and now you've drowned.

85
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,070
You did give me a hard time,

86
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,940
and even forced me to take
on my loathsome transformation.

87
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,180
Now then, I guess I should
go report this to Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

88
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,710
Why did I come to this planet, anyhow?!

89
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,050
We can't get the Dragon Balls,
and our spaceship has been wrecked!

90
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,150
I'm surprised that you can be so calm.

91
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:41,560
It's just a little while longer. When Father
gets here, he'll manage to do something.

92
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,160
I hope Son<i>-kun</i> gets here soon.

93
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:49,330
If I'm forced to stay cooped up in a
place like this for too long, I'll go crazy!

94
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,070
I wonder if Kuririn<i>-san</i> has
found that Grand Elder person.

95
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,050
The <i>ki</i> have subsided.

96
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:10,020
The fight is over.

97
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,230
Which one of them won?

98
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,430
I don't know.

99
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,960
Whichever one of them won,
it's all the same. Let's hurry.

100
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,070
Which way? Should we just
keep going straight like this?

101
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,280
Um, a little more to the left.

102
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,060
There it is. You see that
tall rock over there, right?

103
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,620
T-That one, huh?

104
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,480
Whew, that sure was a long way.

105
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,820
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> is inside that house.

106
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,860
I'm surprised it's still even here.
As conspicuous a location as this is,

107
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,030
it's only a matter of time
before those bad guys find it.

108
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,850
He hasn't already been killed, right?

109
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,660
He couldn't be...

110
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,380
Nail<i>-san</i>! Thank goodness! You're all right!

111
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,250
<i>H-He looks exactly like Piccolo!</i>

112
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,750
Glad you're here, Dende.

113
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:04,230
Visitor, Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> is roughly
familiar with the course of events.

114
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,430
Then, Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>
does know what is happening?

115
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,430
T-That will spare us the
time of explaining, then.

116
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:16,440
Both of you, come inside.
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> will see you.

117
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,380
Um, if he already knows
what is generally going on,

118
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,410
why hasn't he left this unsafe location?

119
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:32,420
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> has grown too aged.
He is aware that his death is approaching.

120
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,260
The only thing he could do is to remain
here quietly, with me here protecting him.

121
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,300
I had heard that his death was near,
but I didn't know it was so close.

122
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,830
Come, inside.

123
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,400
<i>That guy is capable.</i>

124
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,070
<i>I can sense quite a bit of power from</i>
<i>him, compared to the other Namekians.</i>

125
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,280
Up.

126
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,660
Right.

127
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,430
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>, Dende and a visitor.

128
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,800
<i>H-He's huge!</i>

129
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,640
Welcome. You are an Earthling, correct?

130
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:32,850
First, I would like to offer my gratitude
for rescuing my child Dende here. Thank you.

131
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,880
N-Not at all. We didn't
do anything all that great.

132
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,840
That miserable Zarbon! T-This isn't over yet!

133
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,410
I'm going to become even stronger!

134
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:36,210
And then, I'm going to
defeat both Zarbon and Freeza!

135
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:41,050
I-I'm not about to turn over
the Dragon Balls to anyone!

136
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:49,260
<i>Vegeta was alive.</i>

137
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:56,260
<i>However, the hidden power possessed</i>
<i>by Freeza and Zarbon was fearsome.</i>

138
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,270
<i>And after finally meeting him,</i>

139
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:03,270
<i>would the Grand Elder be of</i>
<i>any help to Kuririn and the others?</i>

140
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:11,240
<i>The tangled battle of good and evil</i>
<i>surrounding the Dragon Balls yet continues.</i>

141
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,580
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

142
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,420
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

143
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,800
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

144
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

145
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,810
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

146
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,910
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

147
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

148
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,050
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

149
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,530
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

150
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,660
