<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,310
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,070
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,700
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,950
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,710
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,300
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,220

<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,640
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,660

<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,840

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,370
Videl-<i>san</i>...!

25
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,960
How cowardly of you!

26
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,770
<i>As of now, there is a new hero</i>
<i>in Satan City–the Great Saiyaman!</i>

27
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,190
<i>Satan's daughter, Videl,</i>

28
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,650
<i>had suspicions about the Great Saiyaman's</i>
<i>true identity being Son Gohan.</i>

29
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,640
<i>"A Case of Robbery!!</i>
<i>The Culprit is Saiyaman!?"</i>

30
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,080
Where could Chibi have gone?

31
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,500
When we came to check on him
two days ago, he was here, Big Brother.

32
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,670
He just barely hatched from his egg,
so he shouldn't be able to fly just yet...

33
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:45,670
Come to think of it,
I don't see the Toto couple, either.

34
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,510
All right, why don't we go
look around a little more?

35
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,190
No matter how many times I watch it,
it's still terrific, if I do say so myself.

36
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,860
Videl, if your goal is to be a
great champion like your papa,

37
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,120
you'll have to train even more.

38
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,370
The Tenkaichi Tournament, huh? What fun.

39
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,500
But Papa, the champion before
you was said to be pretty strong, too.

40
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,670
Oh, that Son Goku fellow?

41
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,550
He's a peculiar man,
who used nonsensical tricks.

42
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:31,680
However, when it comes to actual
power, he can't hold a candle to me.

43
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,470
If we had fought at the last tournament,

44
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,720
there's no doubt that your
papa would have beaten him.

45
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,190
<i>Son... Son Goku...?</i>

46
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,690
Goten, you didn't find him?

47
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,860
I wonder if something happened.

48
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,040
At a circus show, which opened today,
a baby monster is drawing smiles.

49
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,500
This rare baby was caught by the promoter,
Mr. Musuka, just the other day,

50
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:07,090
and is as eager to please the
spectators as they are thrilled to see it.

51
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,760
Ah! It's Chibi!

52
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,420
Tomorrow, on Sunday,

53
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,680
there will likely be even greater
numbers of people crowding in to see it.

54
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,680
What does he mean,
eager to please? He's frightened!

55
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,100
He must have been snatched away
while the Toto couple wasn't around.

56
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,100
They wouldn't have kept
quiet about it otherwise.

57
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,520
I feel bad for Chibi, Big Brother.

58
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,070
Don't worry about it, Goten.
Let Big Brother take care of it.

59
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,410
This must be it.

60
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,140
<i>Chibi! Poor thing... I'll make sure I rescue you.</i>

61
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,070
Um...

62
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,650
Mister, are you the one in the
highest position at this circus?

63
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,120
What do you want?

64
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,660
Please put Chibi back up in the
mountains, if you wouldn't mind.

65
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,750
Don't be absurd. We're doing
shows in Metro North next.

66
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,500
This thing is something
I went to a lot of trouble to find.

67
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,460
I intend to have it make
me a bundle from here on.

68
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,140
Make you money?

69
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,680
For you to not only kidnap Chibi,

70
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,680
but to also use him to
make money is just too cruel!

71
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,680
You shut up! I'm the one who caught it!

72
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,100
I can do whatever I want with it!

73
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,650
Dammit, who are you to get in
the way of me making money?

74
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,370
<i>I'll have to wait until nightfall.</i>

75
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,670
<i>Chibi must want to hurry back</i>
<i>to where his mother and father are.</i>

76
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,710
<i>And I'm sure the Totos</i>
<i>are worried about Chibi, too.</i>

77
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,130
<i>Hold on a minute!</i>

78
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,140
<i>What if the Totos are even now</i>
<i>looking for their missing Chibi?</i>

79
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,590
<i>If that's the case, then</i>
<i>this could become terrible!</i>

80
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,410
You behave yourself.

81
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,620
Chibi, don't worry, it's me. It's Gohan.

82
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,510
You're all right now.

83
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,090
Come on, let's go back where your parents are.

84
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,220
All righty...

85
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,060
Who are you?!

86
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,100
I am a champion of justice!

87
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,810
You sneak thief!

88
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,980
It's not like that!

89
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:24,740
It's dangerous to be swinging
something like this around!

90
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,710
W-What kind of guy are you?!

91
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,250
Okay, let's go.

92
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,500
One... two... three...

93
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,130
B-Bad news! Musuka-<i>san,</i>
the monster has been taken!

94
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,760
W-What?!

95
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,500
H-Hey, what's the matter?
Don't give me such a hard time!

96
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,950
Can it be that you're afraid to fly?

97
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,540
I'll guess we'll have to run away on foot, then.

98
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,510
You're still a baby, so what else can we do?

99
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,970
But someday, you'll have to
start flying by yourself, Chibi.

100
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,640
That's the culprit! Arrest him!

101
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,650
Even if he is the Great Saiyaman,
he won't get away with this!

102
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,480
Return the baby monster peacefully!

103
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,980
I can't do that!

104
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,400
All right, now!

105
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,730
<i>If we don't get out of the city soon...</i>

106
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,910
Hold it there, Great Saiyaman!

107
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,920
It stuns me that a champion
of justice would act like a thief,

108
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,420
Great Saiyaman!

109
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,420
You're calling me a thief?

110
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:44,840
Videl-<i>san</i>, please understand.
This fellow is still a baby.

111
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,890
It's best that he be taken back to his parents.

112
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,760
Otherwise, something terrible will happen!

113
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,970
Hand over the monster quietly.

114
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,730
If you insist on refusing, then I'll
take the monster back from you by force.

115
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,410
You never know, you could lose,
and have that mask removed,

116
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,110
Great Saiyaman.

117
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,590
What are you waiting around for?!

118
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,880
Arresting thieves is the police's job, isn't it?!

119
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,670
It's okay. We can leave this up to Videl-<i>san.</i>

120
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,890
Who is that girl?

121
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,470
That's Mister Satan's daughter, Videl-<i>san.</i>

122
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,810
The daughter of the world's
strongest man, Mister Satan?

123
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,400
<i>Of all the times for Videl-san to be around...!</i>

124
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,860
<i>What do I do?</i>

125
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,560
Please stop this, Videl-<i>san</i>!

126
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,980
Have you lost your nerve?

127
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,650
Or if you're just
underestimating me because I'm a girl,

128
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,570
I'll show you how greatly mistaken you are!

129
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,370
I do want to know your true identity,

130
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,580
but I'm also interested
in just how strong you are.

131
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,880
This is the perfect opportunity.
You don't need to restrain yourself.

132
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,670
That's nice of you to say, but...

133
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,180
I'm not going to hold back against you!

134
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,890
H-H-Hold on–

135
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,400
<i>I should have expected as</i>
<i>much from you, Videl-san.</i>

136
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,030
<i>If nothing else, you're far</i>
<i>stronger than Mister Satan.</i>

137
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,870
F-Forgive me.

138
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,750
What are you apologizing for?!

139
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,210
Now's my chance!

140
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,050
Why, you... Defy me, will you?

141
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,560
–Chibi!
–Never mind him, worry
about yourself, Great Saiyaman!

142
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,520
It's not like that!

143
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,520
It's not like what?

144
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,360
If I don't get Chibi back home soon,
something awful could happen to the city!

145
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,690
It's the truth, Videl-<i>san</i>!

146
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,870
It's no use trying to run away
from me with a story like that!

147
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,910
Please understand, Videl-<i>san</i>!

148
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,550
That's it. That's more like it.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any fun.

149
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:12,420
<i>How on earth do I get her to understand?</i>

150
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,010
Chibi...!

151
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,650
Be quiet, you miserable freak!

152
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,280
T-That's done it...

153
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,460
M-Monsters!

154
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,210
F-Fire!

155
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,190
Stop! The Toto couple is
only here to get their baby back!

156
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:13,820
Videl-<i>san</i>, I'm begging you, take Chibi away!

157
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,110
As long as we give them their Chibi back,
the Toto couple should calm down!

158
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,660
Y-Yeah...

159
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,660
Come on, hurry! Otherwise,
something terrible will happen!

160
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,370
A-All right.

161
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,330
Don't shoot!

162
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,180
Settle down, Totos!

163
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,220
Here, we're giving Chibi back
to you, so stop being so angry!

164
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,690
You're friends with those monsters?!

165
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,730
Yeah. We've played together since I was little.

166
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,570
Even though they're worked up right
now, they really are gentle creatures.

167
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:59,450
Although I'm transformed,
they should know that it's me.

168
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:13,880
Toto! It's me! Have you
forgotten?! It's me, Goha–

169
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,720
I-I mean...

170
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,260
You weren't by any chance
about to say "Gohan," were you?

171
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,100
Videl-<i>san</i>, get out of the way!

172
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,350
No way! You're Son
Gohan-<i>kun</i> after all, aren't you?

173
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:33,270
Well? I'm not letting go until I make sure of it!

174
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,400
What are you talking about, at a time like this?!

175
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:39,780
Toto!

176
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,080
W-What are you doing?!

177
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,300
I'm not about to let you take
away my precious moneymaker!

178
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,500
I'll blow you away!

179
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,340
Don't!

180
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,600
Watch out, Videl-<i>san</i>!

181
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,440
Toto, forgive me!

182
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:32,290
Don't worry, Chibi.
Your father is just knocked out.

183
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,130
Great Saiyaman...

184
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,680
Videl-<i>san</i>, I'll ask you to
handle everything else here. Bye!

185
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,450
How nice for you, Chibi! You're not
afraid to fly with your mother, huh?

186
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,150
Gosh, you sure are good-humored.

187
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,290
Dammit! Next time, I'll catch all of you!

188
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:18,040
You do that, and I'll definitely
see that you pay for it.

189
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,670
You've picked the wrong opponent now.
You should probably give it up.

190
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,530
Hey! Thank goodness you're all safe!

191
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,540
Big Brother, thank you!

192
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,430
Oh, no, I'm late!

193
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,720
Morning, Son Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

194
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,270
Ah, Videl-<i>san</i>, good morning.

195
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,110
Thanks for yesterday.

196
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,270
Not at all. I'm glad you weren't hurt, Videl-<i>san.</i>

197
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,110
You can't hide it any longer.

198
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,700
The true identity of the Great Saiyaman...

199
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,290
...is you, Son Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

200
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:38,500
O-Oh, crap! And I was so
perfectly disguised, too...

201
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,100
I thought your voice and the
way you talked was suspicious.

202
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,060
Be that as it may, why did you go to all
the trouble of wearing that strange outfit?

203
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,810
Well, I... if I'm to get along
together with all my friends,

204
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,060
it would be bad if they
found out how strong I am.

205
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,360
Which is why...

206
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,990
Friends?

207
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,990
Uh, well, you know...

208
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,410
Hey, you're the Golden Warrior too, aren't you?

209
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:13,990
Ah, no, that's someone else!

210
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,580
Are you sure about that?

211
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,580
It's the truth!

212
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,460
<i>That part at least absolutely can't get out.</i>

213
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, okay then.

214
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,010
Videl-<i>san</i>, would you keep
this a secret from everyone else?

215
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,010
Sure, depending on how the situation develops.

216
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,310
Oh, and Son Gohan-<i>kun</i>, you're
going to enter the Tenkaichi Tournament

217
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,600
that's taking place in another month, right?

218
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,480
Huh? The Tenkaichi Tournament?

219
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,650
Right. It's a tournament to determine
the champion of combat sportsman.

220
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,610
They're holding it again after a long break.

221
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,610
My papa was the champion at the last one.

222
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:50,360
And before that, it was a
mysterious man named Son Goku,

223
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,820
although I don't know his face.

224
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,950
Same last name as you.
It's not very common these days

225
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,000
to have your name divided into first and last.

226
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,460
I think this man Son Goku
might be your papa. Am I right?

227
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,010
U-Uh, well...

228
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,630
<i>This girl is pretty sharp, huh?</i>

229
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,050
I knew it.

230
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,640
Of course you'll be entering
the Tenkaichi Tournament.

231
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,020
If the last champion's daughter and the
previous champion's son end up fighting,

232
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,020
I think that would have to be interesting.

233
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:27,480
If you can knock out a monster with
just one blow, I'm sure you'll do fine.

234
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,530
N-No, I'm going to pass.

235
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,530
I'm not very interested in that sort of thing.

236
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,490
If you don't enter, I'll let everyone know

237
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,410
that Son Gohan-<i>kun</i> is the
Great Saiyaman's true identity!

238
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,580
Y-You wouldn't!

239
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,710
What's the matter?

240
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:46,420
You can enter as the Great Saiyaman,
and no one will know.

241
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,590
Y-Yeah, but...

242
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,590
You want to be exposed?

243
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:52,590
All right, I'll enter.

244
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,390
Hurray! Then it's settled!
Everyone else seems weak,

245
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,060
and I wanted an opponent
that would be challenging.

246
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,100
<i>Now I've had it. Things have</i>
<i>been turned upside-down.</i>

247
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,100
Ah, and Son Gohan-<i>kun...</i>

248
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,360
–Was there something else?
–Say, teach me how to fly, okay?

249
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,730
It's not fair, you being the only one who can fly.

250
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,280
Okay, Videl-<i>san.</i>

251
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,740
See you later. I'm looking
forward to this, Son Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

252
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,080
I'm no match for Videl-<i>san.</i>

253
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,120
<i>One predicament follows another,</i>

254
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,670
<i>and Gohan is utterly at a</i>
<i>loss as to how to deal with Videl.</i>

255
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,800
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

256
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,390
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

257
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:55,950
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

258
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:02,080
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

259
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:09,040
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

260
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,420
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

261
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,300
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

262
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:27,400
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

263
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,940
<i>Even now?</i>

264
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:36,570
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

265
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,950
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

266
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:48,460
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

267
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:58,470
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

268
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,530
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

269
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,530
<i>The Tenkaichi Tournament, huh?</i>
<i>Sure has been a while.</i>

270
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,870
<i>If Gohan and Vegeta</i>
<i>are entering, then so am I.</i>

271
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,700
<i>Oh, man! If I'd known</i>
<i>I'd be seein' Goku-sa again,</i>

272
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,580
<i>I would've gone to a beauty salon!</i>

273
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,540
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

274
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,880
<i>"Goku Returning to Life!?</i>
<i>Entry into the Tenkaichi Tournament!!"</i>

275
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,840
<i>Whoa, I have to go tell Kuririn-san</i>
<i>and Piccolo-san about this, too.</i>

276
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,590
"Next time"
"Goku Returning to Life!?
Entry into the Tenkaichi Tournament!!"
