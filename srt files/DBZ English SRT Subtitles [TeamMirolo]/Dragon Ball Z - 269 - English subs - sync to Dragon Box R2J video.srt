00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:36,045
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

6
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:54,685

24
00:01:57,455 --> 00:02:00,715

D-Dammit, no!

27
00:02:18,975 --> 00:02:20,525
It couldn't be...!

28
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:25,565
All right! It really is you!

29
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:27,655
K-Kakarrot!

30
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:53,475
It's about time I put you out of your misery!

31
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:55,305
Give it to me! Quickly!

32
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:56,685
Vegeta!

33
00:02:59,355 --> 00:03:01,985
This is the end!

34
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:04,355
This is okay then, right?

35
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:06,855
Thank you, Vegeta!

36
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:20,585
All right!

37
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:27,465
<i>"Magnificent Power!!</i>
<i>Vegetto Surpasses the Ultimate."</i>

38
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:47,605
This is awesome! Better than I imagined!

39
00:04:01,915 --> 00:04:04,295
You seem nervous, huh?

40
00:04:13,465 --> 00:04:15,225
What's the matter?!

41
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:17,725
There's nothing to be particularly
surprised about, is there?

42
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:28,275
Kakarrot and Vegeta have been united,
so I guess that makes me Vegetto.

43
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,445
I wondered what was going to happen,

44
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:33,445
but it appears as if they
successfully combined together.

45
00:04:33,485 --> 00:04:36,285
Now then, let's continue!

46
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:43,295
So that's it? Still, do you think that
just by combining you two together,

47
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:46,125
that you are a match for me?

48
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:00,185
Don't you toy with me!

49
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:52,525
I felt that a bit just now.

50
00:05:57,405 --> 00:06:02,365
Is that so? I was still
trying to hold back on you.

51
00:06:14,505 --> 00:06:18,885
What's the matter? You aren't about
to cash it in from just that, are you?

52
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:41,245
All right... I've finally gotten warmed up.

53
00:06:41,285 --> 00:06:45,245
My apologies! I'm still not used to this body!

54
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:49,755
But I'm okay now!
This time, we'll get started for sure!

55
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:53,585
Let's do that! If you were
to have died on me like this,

56
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,215
I would have been greatly disappointed!

57
00:06:55,255 --> 00:06:57,255
The fun is just beginning!

58
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:44,845
N-Now you've done it...!

59
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:51,305
The Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> was right.
The power of these Potara is incredible!

60
00:08:03,485 --> 00:08:05,865
That's more like it.

61
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:24,385
Hey, aren't we there yet?

62
00:08:26,515 --> 00:08:29,895
W-What are all these tremors?!

63
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:35,485
It's likely that it is the
sound of Goku-<i>san</i> fighting.

64
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:38,855
W-We can hear it all the way over here?

65
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:12,475
I see. You do seem stronger than
you were when it was the two of you.

66
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:18,315
Indeed I have gotten stronger!
Enough to be able to kill you!

67
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:20,695
Enough of you being
carried away with yourself!

68
00:09:20,735 --> 00:09:22,865
I was planning on playing
around with you a bit more,

69
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:24,365
but I'm not going to hold back any longer!

70
00:09:24,405 --> 00:09:26,245
I'm sending you to the Next World right now!

71
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:29,745
If you can do it, go ahead and try!

72
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:46,885
I-Incredible! It's incredible!

73
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:50,805
To think that he can fight toe-to-toe with
Majin Boo after he powered up that much!

74
00:09:51,805 --> 00:09:54,935
Toe-to-toe, you say?

75
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:59,275
Look, you, where in the world
are you directing your eyes?

76
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:04,275
Open up your eyes and watch closely!

77
00:10:15,785 --> 00:10:19,375
Boo is... The Majin is being overcome!

78
00:10:19,415 --> 00:10:22,755
He can win! At this pace,
he can win against Majin Boo!

79
00:10:22,795 --> 00:10:25,755
Right, Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?

80
00:10:25,795 --> 00:10:28,635
No! We cannot tell.

81
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:35,935
The fight's outcome,
you see, is a matter of fortune.

82
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:39,895
However, see, if he doesn't win, you see,

83
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:44,395
then there's probably nobody
else that can win against him, see?

84
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:49,025
We're counting on you! Goku-<i>san</i>! Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

85
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:15,885
N-Not bad... How do you like this?

86
00:12:11,115 --> 00:12:13,245
How about it? Did you find him?

87
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:16,615
Mm-mm. It's no use, we didn't find him.

88
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:19,075
What about you, Videl-<i>san</i>?

89
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:23,585
It's no good. I didn't find him anywhere.

90
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:27,045
I, too, have searched all over...

91
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:32,675
I see... Just where in the
world has that Gohan gone?

92
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:38,595
Say, there's no supposin'
he's gone to Hell, right?

93
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:42,225
Gohan-<i>kun</i> would be the
absolute last person to do that!

94
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:43,775
She's right!

95
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:48,525
There is no way a magnificent
gentleman like that could go to Hell.

96
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:52,575
Huh?

97
00:12:52,615 --> 00:12:57,575
Y-You know something,
you've changed quite a bit, huh?

98
00:12:57,615 --> 00:12:59,325
You were the king of the
Demon Realm of Darkness,

99
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:02,165
and Babidi's right-hand man, right?

100
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:05,755
Y-Yes... However, here in Heaven,

101
00:13:05,795 --> 00:13:09,175
I have learned the importance of mind and life!

102
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:12,135
As well, thanks to everyone's encouragement,

103
00:13:12,175 --> 00:13:15,505
I have been able to be
born again as superbly as this.

104
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:21,185
Y-You don't say...

105
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:25,645
Well, that being so, Chichi-<i>san,</i>
it would indeed be ridiculous!

106
00:13:25,685 --> 00:13:28,445
From what I hear, never mind Earth,

107
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:33,655
the dead spirits from the whole universe
are beginning to gather here in Heaven.

108
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,365
And within those billions, those trillions...

109
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:39,035
mm-mm, even greater numbers of spirits,

110
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:41,875
it doesn't seem likely to
find just one Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

111
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:47,005
I hear that Heaven here is
comparable to the universe in size.

112
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:52,005
Even so... even so...

113
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:54,005
I'm so sorry for you, Chichi-<i>san</i>!

114
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:56,345
Please, find it in yourself to take heart!

115
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,845
I, Dabura, will be certain to find Gohan-<i>san.</i>

116
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:02,885
Leave that to me, if you please!

117
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:26,585
What?

118
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:40,055
Is that... don't tell me...!

119
00:14:41,425 --> 00:14:44,395
Yes, that's right!

120
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:50,355
There's enough energy gathered in
here to smash the planet to smithereens!

121
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:54,195
Will you indeed be able to stop this?

122
00:14:54,235 --> 00:14:57,195
If you fear for your life, you can also dodge it!

123
00:14:57,235 --> 00:14:59,785
However, once it falls to the ground,

124
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:03,455
it's all over–the Earth will be blown away!

125
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:07,955
Without a trace, in an instant!
Now what will you do?!

126
00:15:14,465 --> 00:15:16,755
Hide yourself around here, if you would.

127
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:18,965
Huh?! You don't mean...?

128
00:15:36,855 --> 00:15:41,615
Please, be quiet, Satan-<i>san</i>!
We'll be detected by Majin Boo!

129
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:11,225
Is that...?

130
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:18,905
Who is that guy? He looks
a little like that Goku guy.

131
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:24,785
That is Goku-<i>san</i>. So that's it!

132
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:28,285
Here I thought I could feel Vegeta-<i>san</i>'s <i>ki</i> too!

133
00:16:28,325 --> 00:16:30,285
So that's what's going on!

134
00:16:30,325 --> 00:16:32,455
W-What's going on?

135
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:37,715
Satan-<i>san</i>, it's just possible
the Earth will be saved!

136
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:41,385
R-Really?

137
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,845
That's great!

138
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:45,385
H-Hey, hey...!

139
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:48,055
You can't go off so far on your own!

140
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:54,225
You shouldn't do that, you know!
Be happy! The Earth is...

141
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:30,055
What is he going to do with
all that enormous energy?

142
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:33,185
Don't tell me Majin Boo is
going to destroy the Earth!

143
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:40,855
So, then, are you prepared?

144
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:45,405
Prepared? You don't get it, huh?

145
00:17:45,445 --> 00:17:49,745
Do you seriously think that all
that bluster is going to work on me?

146
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,365
What did you say?!

147
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:55,745
Well, fine. I'll give it a try.

148
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:06,635
Whenever you like! I promise you,
I won't run even one step.

149
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:12,595
You carry your boasting too far!

150
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:15,805
In that case, you and the
Earth together can cease to exist!

151
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,735
It's over!

152
00:19:09,325 --> 00:19:11,285
G-Goku-<i>san</i>!

153
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:39,225
Here, I'm returning this to you!

154
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:44,495
Y-Yeow!

155
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:50,255
Satan-<i>san</i>!

156
00:21:20,365 --> 00:21:23,335
What's that smug look for?

157
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,415
Are you proud of yourself for
bouncing that back just now?

158
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,175
You certainly have become stronger.

159
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:35,215
However, you still cannot
say you have surpassed me!

160
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:41,475
Is that so? In that case, how about I show you?

161
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:56,235
What is he planning to do now?

162
00:22:12,425 --> 00:22:15,385
This is Super Vegetto!!

163
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:22,845
<i>At last, the ultra-warrior</i>
<i>emerges–Super Vegetto!</i>

164
00:22:22,885 --> 00:22:26,355
<i>The end of time for Majin Boo is approaching.</i>

165
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:38,775
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

166
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:45,365
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

167
00:22:49,585 --> 00:22:55,925
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

168
00:22:55,965 --> 00:23:02,055
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

169
00:23:02,095 --> 00:23:09,065
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

170
00:23:09,105 --> 00:23:14,445
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

171
00:23:15,105 --> 00:23:18,275
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

172
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:27,375
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

173
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:28,915
<i>Even now?</i>

174
00:23:28,955 --> 00:23:36,545
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

175
00:23:36,585 --> 00:23:41,925
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

176
00:23:41,965 --> 00:23:48,435
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

177
00:23:48,475 --> 00:23:58,445
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

178
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,675
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

179
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:19,345
<i>What's the matter, Majin Boo?</i>
<i>It looks like you're powerless now.</i>

180
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:21,055
<i>Talk about your disappointments!</i>

181
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:23,515
<i>You idiot! Hurry up and finish him off!</i>

182
00:24:23,555 --> 00:24:26,225
<i>Don't back Boo any further into a corner!</i>

183
00:24:26,265 --> 00:24:28,345
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

184
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,065
<i>"A Fissure Between Dimensions!!</i>
<i>Has Boo Snapped!?"</i>

185
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:34,645
<i>This is bad. Boo is really steamed now.</i>

186
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:39,565
"Next time"
"A Fissure Between Dimensions!!
Has Boo Snapped!?"
