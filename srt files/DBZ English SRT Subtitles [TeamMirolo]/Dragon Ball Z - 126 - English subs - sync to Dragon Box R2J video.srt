27
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:23,445
Hey, Gohan!

28
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:26,185
You don't have to fly yourself all
out like that, we'll get there in time!

29
00:03:26,225 --> 00:03:29,345
You're going to use all your
strength before the fight even starts!

30
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:30,375
Okay!

31
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:34,355
Son Goku, how about it?

32
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:37,355
In your honest opinion,
against these new foes...

33
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:39,355
Do you think we can win?

34
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:42,865
There's no way to know
without seeing them first.

35
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:45,365
I'll tell you once we get started.

36
00:03:45,405 --> 00:03:48,805
How nice for you to be so carefree.

37
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:52,775
I'm sure I can beat these Artificial Humans...

38
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,345
But I can't shake this terrible
foreboding feeling I have.

39
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:58,045
Terrible foreboding?

40
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:04,855
Piccolo, do me a favor, if things
get rough on you, don't overdo it.

41
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:09,055
After all, if you die, the
Dragon Balls will disappear too.

42
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:15,395
Father, look! It's Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

43
00:04:16,905 --> 00:04:18,895
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

44
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:23,705
Look how big you're getting, Gohan!

45
00:04:23,745 --> 00:04:24,875
Hey!

46
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:27,045
–Hey...
–What's the matter, Kuririn?

47
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:30,715
After all this time,
aren't you excited to see us?

48
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:33,045
We're just about to wage the fight
of our lives against horrible monsters.

49
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:35,845
How can you expect me to be cheery?

50
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:39,355
I'm not a Super Saiyan, you know.

51
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:42,855
About nine kilometers southwest of Metro South...

52
00:04:42,895 --> 00:04:45,735
There it is! That island there!

53
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,275
This is a pretty big island.

54
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,545
Yeah. This is bad.

55
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:03,075
There's a relatively large city down there.

56
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:08,715
If we can't lure the Artificial
Humans away from here,

57
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:12,885
the people down there will
likely become casualties of our fight.

58
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:14,585
You're right.

59
00:05:15,765 --> 00:05:19,025
I can feel a pair of large
<i>ki</i> over on that mountain.

60
00:05:19,065 --> 00:05:21,365
That's probably Yamucha and the others.

61
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:23,235
Right, let's go!

62
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:29,035
It's them, all right, Goku's group!

63
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:30,735
Hey, there!

64
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:35,075
Hey!

65
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:44,415
We've been waiting for you.
You guys are a little late.

66
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:46,885
Bulma!

67
00:05:46,925 --> 00:05:48,415
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

68
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:54,925
Yoo-hoo! Wow, look how
tall you are now, Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

69
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:03,175
I don't believe it! What are you doing here?

70
00:06:03,215 --> 00:06:05,905
Observing, of course!

71
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:07,345
It'll be all right.

72
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:10,915
I just want a quick look at the
Artificial Humans, then I'll go back.

73
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,845
Never mind that,

74
00:06:12,885 --> 00:06:17,015
I'm more surprised by what you've
got in your arms there, Bulma<i>-san.</i>

75
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:20,225
You've gotten married, right?
You and Yamucha<i>-san.</i>

76
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:23,725
He isn't my kid.

77
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:28,925
We broke up some time ago.

78
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:32,065
You'll be shocked when
you hear whose kid that is.

79
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:40,415
Your daddy is Vegeta, huh, Trunks?

80
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,375
How did you know that?

81
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:48,875
I wanted to surprise everyone
here, so I didn't contact any of you!

82
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:52,785
Uh, yeah, I just sort of
had a hunch, you know?

83
00:06:52,825 --> 00:06:56,165
I mean, his face does
kind of look like Vegeta's.

84
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,395
You even guessed his name!

85
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:02,195
Wow, really? Incredible!

86
00:07:02,235 --> 00:07:05,535
I wonder if I have psychic abilities.

87
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:08,405
That's really Vegeta's child?

88
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:15,405
So where is Vegeta, anyhow?
I don't see him around.

89
00:07:15,445 --> 00:07:19,915
Well, I don't know.
We haven't been living together.

90
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:22,385
He'll probably be here before long, though.

91
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:26,015
He's apparently gone through a
lot of training to prepare for this day.

92
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:29,895
Oh, he'll come. He'll come for sure.

93
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:34,025
As far as Chaozu goes,
I left him behind this time.

94
00:07:34,065 --> 00:07:36,405
Frankly, he's not up to this kind of fight.

95
00:07:39,945 --> 00:07:41,905
So, what time is it now?

96
00:07:41,945 --> 00:07:44,705
Let's see, it's 9:30.

97
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,375
They'll show themselves in
another thirty minutes or so.

98
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,875
You really should go
back now, while you still can.

99
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:53,885
Especially since you've got that baby with you!

100
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:58,085
Like I said, once I get a peek at
the Artificial Humans, I'll go back.

101
00:08:14,945 --> 00:08:18,075
So, thirty more minutes.

102
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:26,915
Hey, Trunks!

103
00:08:26,955 --> 00:08:29,425
Trunks<i>-chan</i>!

104
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:35,095
I've made you another toy! Huh?

105
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:41,395
Don't tell me Bulma's taken him to
show off around the neighborhood again?

106
00:08:41,435 --> 00:08:45,435
I swear, there's just no
helping someone like her.

107
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:49,835
On the other hand,
he's such a cute grandson!

108
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,705
Who can blame her?

109
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:56,875
Boy, is he going to be
surprised when I show him this!

110
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:24,375
Googly-googly-goo!

111
00:09:31,915 --> 00:09:34,885
Say, Kuririn<i>-san</i>, you give it a try!

112
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,885
Who, me?

113
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:39,725
I wonder what kind of face should I pull?

114
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:45,725
Ahem, I haven't done anything yet.

115
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:50,395
There's someone headed this way.

116
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:54,865
They aren't malicious.

117
00:09:54,905 --> 00:09:56,875
Maybe it's Vegeta<i>-san.</i>

118
00:09:56,915 --> 00:09:59,245
Nah, he is malicious.

119
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:06,075
Ah, there they are, there!

120
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,855
Yajirobe!

121
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:17,025
I'm glad I got here in time.

122
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:19,725
Have you come to fight too?

123
00:10:23,135 --> 00:10:27,365
Here. I'm droppin' off these
senzu Karin<i>-sama</i> sent yas.

124
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:31,405
My hero! You can always count on Karin<i>-sama</i>!

125
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,705
Well, besta luck to yas.

126
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,375
Yajirobe, you're fighting too, ain't you?

127
00:10:38,415 --> 00:10:41,045
See now, I ain't like the resta you idiots,

128
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:42,885
'cuz I don't wanna die.

129
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,415
Don't tell me ya expected
me to hang around with y'all.

130
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:53,795
Don't you guys find it a little strange?

131
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:56,195
It's well past 10 o'clock now,

132
00:10:56,235 --> 00:11:00,205
yet we still haven't felt
any sign of our opponents.

133
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:02,075
Now that you mention it...

134
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:10,375
You don't suppose what
he told us isn't true, do you?

135
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,375
I mean, Artificial Humans! Come on!

136
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:15,085
Well, he did say it was around 10 o'clock.

137
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:19,055
It's only 10:17 now, so
it's too early to tell for sure.

138
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:22,885
Yeah, but figure, we're
not sensing any strong <i>ki.</i>

139
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:24,555
If they're really all that strong,

140
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:27,265
we should be able to sense
them anywhere on Earth.

141
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,405
What happened?!

142
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,435
It's Yajirobe!

143
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:49,385
Look! There's someone there!
They attacked him!

144
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:56,185
They've descended into the city!

145
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:58,165
Where did they go?!

146
00:12:01,335 --> 00:12:03,365
Did you see them, Goku?

147
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:06,965
No! I didn't see what they looked like!

148
00:12:07,005 --> 00:12:08,865
How can it be?

149
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,905
I didn't sense any <i>ki</i> at all!

150
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:16,875
It's because they're Artificial Humans!

151
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:19,075
They don't have <i>ki</i>!

152
00:12:19,885 --> 00:12:21,755
They what?!

153
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:36,735
Where are they?! Where did they go?!

154
00:12:41,405 --> 00:12:42,745
Damn.

155
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:49,045
If we can't sense their <i>ki</i>, we'll
just have to search them out visually.

156
00:12:49,085 --> 00:12:52,545
All right. Let's split up and find them.

157
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:55,075
Bulma, hang on to these!

158
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:59,055
Remember now, don't get in over your heads.

159
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:02,355
Once you find them, let the
rest of us know immediately!

160
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:04,025
Gohan, you look after Yajirobe.

161
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:05,655
He should still be alive.

162
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:07,295
Right!

163
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:09,895
Let's go!!

164
00:13:39,595 --> 00:13:42,095
Shoot! Where are they?! Where did they go?!

165
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:54,745
I wish I'd had Trunks show me
a photo of them or something.

166
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:18,765
Dammit, man. Where are they?!

167
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:22,105
He-He flew here!

168
00:14:22,145 --> 00:14:24,075
That's not them.

169
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,705
Them either.

170
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:32,015
–Hey, have you seen anyone
out of the ordinary?
–Y-Yeah!

171
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:33,685
What?!

172
00:14:33,725 --> 00:14:35,715
You!

173
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:17,385
Are you okay?

174
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,065
Who were them guys?

175
00:15:31,415 --> 00:15:34,245
Are those guys really here somewhere?

176
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:41,755
Hey, look at that. It fell into the ocean.

177
00:15:47,425 --> 00:15:49,555
Hey, did you fellas see it too?

178
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:52,765
A Sky Car just blew up!

179
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:04,745
Did you see it?

180
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:13,075
What's the matter?

181
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:40,035
Hey you, get out of my way!

182
00:16:40,075 --> 00:16:42,015
I said move it!

183
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:48,985
Stupid clod, what do you think
you're doing in the middle of the stree–?

184
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:54,575
A scream!

185
00:17:57,495 --> 00:18:01,325
A human with an abnormally
high energy level is approaching.

186
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:04,395
Could my Search System be malfunctioning?

187
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:09,895
It is not a malfunction, No. 20.
I am tracking the same energy.

188
00:18:09,935 --> 00:18:14,065
But this reading is far beyond
our data for a normal person.

189
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:19,675
We've found him already. It is Son Goku.

190
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:25,615
It came from around here.

191
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:39,225
Where are they? Where have they gone?

192
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:51,875
Hey, you there!

193
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:57,075
You two!

194
00:18:58,085 --> 00:19:00,915
Who was it that killed these people?

195
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:02,045
Did you see anything?

196
00:19:02,085 --> 00:19:08,055
–Yeah, there were two strange guys.
–Right, they were there just
a second ago, but they disappeared.

197
00:19:08,095 --> 00:19:10,725
They disappeared?

198
00:19:10,765 --> 00:19:12,395
<i>Damn.</i>

199
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,195
In any case, I'd better call everyone.

200
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:26,405
No, it is not Son Goku.

201
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:28,745
There is no exact data match.

202
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:45,035
There is a 96 percent probability
that this is the human Yamucha.

203
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:50,365
In any event, we can take a
great deal of energy from him.

204
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:58,045
But without those guys here,
what's the point in calling everyone in?

205
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,075
I don't suppose you guys saw anything?

206
00:20:03,115 --> 00:20:06,775
Like where those two murderers ran off to?

207
00:20:19,395 --> 00:20:20,735
Don't tell me...

208
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:24,735
We're them.

209
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,505
Everybody!

210
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:15,025
What's that?!

211
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:32,535
<i>M-My power...</i>

212
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:21,885
<i>Finally, the attack of the Artificial Humans,</i>

213
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,385
<i>whose only purpose is that</i>
<i>of mass slaughter, has begun.</i>

214
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:28,915
<i>What will be the fate of</i>
<i>Yamucha, their first victim?</i>

215
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:48,305
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

216
00:22:48,345 --> 00:22:54,145
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

217
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:56,515
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

218
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:05,025
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

219
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:11,535
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

220
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:15,635
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

221
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:19,135
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

222
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:21,775
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

223
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:29,285
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

224
00:23:31,525 --> 00:23:33,355
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

225
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,185
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

226
00:23:35,225 --> 00:23:39,225
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

227
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:44,895
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

228
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:47,065
<i>So sorry.</i>

229
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:52,205
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

230
00:23:54,945 --> 00:24:00,215
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

231
00:24:11,895 --> 00:24:13,695
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

232
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:16,465
<i>Hey, you Artificial Humans!</i>
<i>How dare you do that to Yamucha!</i>

233
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:18,935
<i>Come with me, both</i>
<i>of you! I'll smash you up!</i>

234
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:22,805
<i>You guys don't understand how</i>
<i>terrible these Artificial Humans are!</i>

235
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:25,775
<i>Those guys suck the power out of you!</i>

236
00:24:25,815 --> 00:24:27,945
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

237
