<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,065 --> 00:00:24,365
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:29,625
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:36,375
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:42,965
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,005 --> 00:00:51,805
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,355 --> 00:01:04,325
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,785
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:13,915
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:38,645
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:56,295
<i>Son Gohan versus Cell!</i>

17
00:01:56,335 --> 00:02:01,715
<i>The battle over the fate of the Earth</i>
<i>has begun with Cell's one-sided offensive!</i>

18
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:19,185
Goku! You're responsible for this!

19
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:22,145
You've completely underestimated the situation!

20
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,485
Everyone warned you about this!

21
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:26,735
Take it easy, Piccolo.

22
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:29,825
Gohan's <i>ki</i> ain't dropped in the least, has it?

23
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:30,945
What?

24
00:02:46,215 --> 00:02:50,925
When I fly off the handle,
I seem to go beyond my own will,

25
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:53,885
and start fighting
hysterically with amazing power.

26
00:02:55,975 --> 00:03:01,065
If it comes to that, I'm sure I will kill you.

27
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:07,615
Did you think I would be
scared off by hearing that story?

28
00:03:07,655 --> 00:03:09,195
You really are a brat.

29
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:13,615
On the contrary, now I want to
make you angry, no matter what.

30
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:16,455
I want to have a look at this
so-called hidden power you have!

31
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:57,455
Son Gohan, no matter what it takes,
I'm going to make you angry.

32
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:04,545
<i>"Teeny Menaces!!</i>
<i>Attack of the Cell Juniors."</i>

33
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:32,325
<i>Gohan, get angry! Get angry!</i>

34
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:35,865
<i>By doing so, you'll be able</i>
<i>to draw out your true power!</i>

35
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:41,955
W-What's going to happen, Mister Satan?

36
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:43,545
It's irresponsible!

37
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:46,665
Having a child fight like this, it's crazy!

38
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:51,175
If nobody defeats Cell in these Cell Games,

39
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:54,305
every person on Earth is going to be killed.

40
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:59,685
And yet, is that young boy the only
one who will fight the ferocious Cell?

41
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:02,355
Isn't there anybody else?!

42
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:05,395
Mister Satan, is your
stomachache still bothering you?

43
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:09,855
It's still stinging!

44
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:17,075
Our star of hope, Mister Satan,
is still suffering from his stomachache!

45
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:20,705
Is there no savior who
can reclaim our future for us?

46
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:28,455
Son Gohan, you will show
me your so-called hidden power.

47
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:42,055
That's the technique that Freeza used!

48
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,275
Gohan, don't let him get you!

49
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:11,925
Well, what's the matter?
This hurts, right? Get angry!

50
00:06:11,965 --> 00:06:15,585
You don't want to die like this, do you?

51
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:25,685
D-Dammit...! G-Gohan!

52
00:06:30,185 --> 00:06:31,945
Well, what's wrong?

53
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:36,985
Why do you hesitate?
Your bones are going to break!

54
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:42,445
You couldn't dislike fighting so
much that you would rather endure this.

55
00:06:46,165 --> 00:06:48,955
The young boy is being tormented!

56
00:06:48,995 --> 00:06:52,465
What monstrous power! Will the child give up?

57
00:06:52,505 --> 00:06:54,505
What will become of the Earth's future?

58
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,215
What is to be our fate?!

59
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:05,145
Dammit, I can't take this any more!

60
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:10,525
Goku! I don't care what you say,
I'm going to go help Gohan!

61
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:11,855
Wait, Piccolo!

62
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:15,945
Frankly, he ain't the sort
of opponent you can handle!

63
00:07:15,985 --> 00:07:18,985
Just a little longer... wait just a little bit longer.

64
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:22,195
Wait, you say?! What do you mean?

65
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:25,535
Are you saying that I should
wait while he gets killed like this?!

66
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:27,415
Wait for Gohan to get angry.

67
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:32,505
He will most likely release
his true power through his anger,

68
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:35,835
and show us some
terrifying strength all at once!

69
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,215
There's only one way to defeat Cell.

70
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:43,675
We have to rely on Gohan and his power!

71
00:07:46,185 --> 00:07:51,515
<i>What? That kid has that kind of power?</i>

72
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:59,735
Get angry. This isn't enough? It must hurt, right?

73
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:04,995
Your anger has to be welling up!

74
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:08,285
Goku, you're mistaken!

75
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:13,085
Gohan doesn't like to fight the way you do!

76
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,505
Does Gohan know about your strategy?!

77
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:18,875
Did you make sure to discuss it with him?!

78
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:23,925
Do you know what Gohan is thinking right now?

79
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:25,345
It's not about anger!

80
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:31,565
"Why won't Father help me,
when I'm suffering like this?"

81
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:36,945
"Is having a fair, manly fight more
important than my life?" and so on!

82
00:08:36,985 --> 00:08:38,105
Don't forget!

83
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:41,445
Even supposing his powers
have made him number one,

84
00:08:41,485 --> 00:08:44,325
he is still a child!

85
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:51,325
I don't care if he does
let me have it! I'm going in!

86
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:06,975
Kuririn! Let me have a <i>senzu</i>!

87
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:08,475
O-Okay!

88
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,655
You're a stubborn one!

89
00:09:27,695 --> 00:09:29,955
It would appear that your own pain alone

90
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:32,915
will not bring your anger to a boil...

91
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:37,545
Okay then, how about we
take it up with your friends?

92
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,045
Stop!

93
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:47,635
Cell is flying!

94
00:10:01,315 --> 00:10:04,155
There are <i>senzu</i> in here, right?

95
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,865
They must be cumbersome, so I'll take them.

96
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:09,285
O-Oh, no!

97
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,245
D-Damn!

98
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:23,255
It's not even worth my trouble
to take on the likes of them.

99
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:27,305
W-What are you planning to do?!

100
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:28,345
Whatever I want to!

101
00:10:28,385 --> 00:10:32,475
If that's what it takes to make you angry
enough to exhibit your so-called true power.

102
00:10:32,515 --> 00:10:34,975
You have a peculiar way of enduring pain,

103
00:10:35,015 --> 00:10:37,475
so now your friends are going to get hurt.

104
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:39,185
D-Don't do it, please!

105
00:10:39,225 --> 00:10:44,855
I can't control it under
my own power! That's why...

106
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:48,825
That's why I'm going to hurt your friends,

107
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:52,205
in order to draw your power out!

108
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,825
Watch out! He's about to do something!

109
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:56,745
Damn...

110
00:10:56,785 --> 00:11:00,415
I should have taken a <i>senzu</i> before!

111
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:07,425
Damn you!

112
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:15,265
If you're going to get angry,
then get full-on angry!

113
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:20,975
N-No. 16!

114
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:29,445
Oh, my! Another man has come forward!

115
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:33,905
Will he be the savior of the Earth?!

116
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:34,915
No. 16!

117
00:11:34,955 --> 00:11:38,875
He's a robot, so he doesn't
have any presence to detect!

118
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:41,455
No. 16 intends to defeat Cell!

119
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:44,465
N-No matter how strong
he is, he can't do it alone!

120
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:47,295
Let's get in there too!

121
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:49,425
W-Wait! Stay back!

122
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:54,635
I'm going to blow myself up, together with Cell!

123
00:12:07,195 --> 00:12:08,565
You're going to what?!

124
00:12:08,605 --> 00:12:13,075
I've got a powerful self-destruct
device equipped within my body.

125
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:16,155
It is my final, hidden power.

126
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,995
Forgive me for forcing the rest
of you to get caught up with this

127
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:21,165
and become casualties!

128
00:12:30,965 --> 00:12:33,175
Cell! No matter how powerful you might be,

129
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:36,845
at this close range, you'll be blown to bits!

130
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:59,955
This is where it ends, Cell!

131
00:12:59,995 --> 00:13:03,335
Both you and I are going
to be blown to smithereens!

132
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:14,345
This is where the schemes of Doctor Gero,
who created us Artificial Humans,

133
00:13:14,385 --> 00:13:16,675
and planned to conquer the world, all fall apart!

134
00:13:27,025 --> 00:13:28,855
N-No. 16!

135
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:38,785
Here goes!

136
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:01,225
You guys, protect me!

137
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:03,555
Now, hold on...!

138
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:06,815
I am your master! Protect me!

139
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:18,075
Mama!

140
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:39,305
W-What's the matter?

141
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:58,195
W-Why? Why don't I explode?

142
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:01,995
N-No. 16!

143
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:06,205
Y-You... can't self-destruct!

144
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:13,835
I heard it from Bulma-<i>san...</i>

145
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:21,135
The doc... the doc removed the bomb
that was concealed within your body!

146
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:24,135
What?!

147
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:27,685
Is that right, Bulma?

148
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,975
It was then...

149
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:44,325
Oh? Is that...?

150
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:51,125
Bulma, would you do a magnification scan

151
00:15:51,165 --> 00:15:53,125
on this area around the heart for me?

152
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,205
Sure thing!

153
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:12,525
Apparently, it's a self-destruct device.

154
00:16:12,565 --> 00:16:15,315
And it's no ordinary bomb, at that.

155
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:18,985
It might just blow the whole earth up.

156
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:26,205
So, Doctor Gero installed one of
these inside No. 16's body, did he?

157
00:16:26,245 --> 00:16:29,865
It was probably to defeat Son-<i>kun</i> with, after all.

158
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:35,085
It surely must have been a final measure.

159
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,425
It's not safe. Let's take it out.

160
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,925
That's right...

161
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:46,265
Papa removed it from him back then.

162
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:53,605
No. 16! You can't self-destruct!

163
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:02,445
Too bad about that, huh No. 16?

164
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:07,285
Although, I doubt I would have
died from your bomb anyhow.

165
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,465
No. 16!

166
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:46,155
No. 16, it would appear that
you were one of Doctor Gero's

167
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:49,155
failed models after all.

168
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:10,305
Satan-<i>sama</i>, not in front of the others!

169
00:18:12,555 --> 00:18:14,725
Oh, dear, Satan-<i>sama</i>...!

170
00:18:16,015 --> 00:18:19,315
Caroni, go put that thing someplace else, quickly.

171
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:22,485
Right.

172
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,075
Get out of here...!

173
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:47,385
Well now, is there no one
who will come after me next?!

174
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:53,015
D-Dirty rotten scumbag...!

175
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:03,315
Son Gohan, apparently you
still haven't come around, huh?

176
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:06,275
But you watch, I will make
you angry, no matter what!

177
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:16,575
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

178
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:20,585
Seven altogether, huh? All right...!

179
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:30,965
W-What is he planning to do this time?!

180
00:20:13,925 --> 00:20:16,845
W-What are they?!

181
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:22,315
Once again, something strange has come forth.

182
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:30,485
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

183
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:32,115
There are seven of them in all!

184
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:34,245
What on earth are these
seven mysterious beasts

185
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:37,455
that have sprung out of Cell's back?!

186
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:42,625
What are they?

187
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:45,505
What in the world are those weird things?

188
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:01,765
Now then, my Cell Juniors,

189
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:04,775
your opponents are those seven
who are on that rock over there.

190
00:21:04,815 --> 00:21:06,985
Do them harm.

191
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:09,895
If you like, you can kill them. I don't mind.

192
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:15,235
Go!

193
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,535
Watch yourselves!

194
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:23,875
These guys are terrifyingly strong!

195
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,255
These runts?!

196
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:38,385
It's useless. There's absolutely
no way you will beat them.

197
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:42,595
They may be small,
but they are still my children.

198
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:10,005
<i>Cell's terror knows no bounds.</i>

199
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:13,675
<i>How much power is</i>
<i>possessed by these Cell Juniors,</i>

200
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:16,635
<i>the small monsters whom Cell has produced?</i>

201
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:48,875
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

202
00:22:48,915 --> 00:22:54,675
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

203
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:57,095
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

204
00:23:00,555 --> 00:23:05,555
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

205
00:23:07,895 --> 00:23:12,105
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

206
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:16,195
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

207
00:23:16,235 --> 00:23:19,695
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

208
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:22,325
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

209
00:23:24,075 --> 00:23:29,835
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

210
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:33,925
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

211
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:35,755
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

212
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:39,755
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

213
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:45,475
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

214
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:47,605
<i>So sorry.</i>

215
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:52,775
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

216
00:23:55,525 --> 00:24:00,775
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

217
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,255
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

218
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:17,715
<i>Sorry, everybody. You're</i>
<i>all in danger because of me.</i>

219
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:21,845
<i>Son Gohan, it is no sin</i>
<i>to fight for what is right.</i>

220
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:26,015
<i>You don't have to take it</i>
<i>any longer. Release your anger.</i>

221
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:28,435
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

222
00:24:28,475 --> 00:24:32,935
<i>"The Tragic No. 16!! An Enraged</i>
<i>Super Gohan Begins Taking Action."</i>

223
00:24:32,975 --> 00:24:36,235
<i>Cell, I'll see that you pay for this!</i>

224
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:38,395
"Next time"
"The Tragic No. 16!! An Enraged
Super Gohan Begins Taking Action"
