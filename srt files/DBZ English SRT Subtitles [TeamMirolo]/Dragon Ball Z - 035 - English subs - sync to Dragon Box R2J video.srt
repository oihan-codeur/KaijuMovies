<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:52,300
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,810
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:04,820
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,290
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:37,180
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,100
<i>A Genki Dama, filled</i>
<i>with the Earth's hopes...</i>

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,990
<i>However, not even that</i>
<i>was enough to finish Vegeta off.</i>

18
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,640
<i>The terrible Vegeta was the</i>
<i>mightiest of Saiyan warriors. But just then...</i>

19
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,310
T-This brat has... re-grown his tail!

20
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,750
<i>"Cause a Miracle!</i>
<i>Son Gohan, the Super Saiyan."</i>

21
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,560
Which way?

22
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,430
The left. A little more to the left.

23
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,770
Ah, I see it! That's the island!

24
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,800
That island is where Goku
and the others are fighting.

25
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:15,110
What about Gohan?! Gohan<i>-chan</i>
really is still alive, right?! Really?!

26
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:17,120
P-Probably...

27
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,530
What do you mean, "probably"?!
"Probably" isn't good enough!

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,130
I told you we shouldn't have brought her.

29
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,760
<i>Still, I'm worried about</i>
<i>the four– no, five of them.</i>

30
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,370
<i>I can barely sense any ki from any of them.</i>

31
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:53,020
H-His tail? That's right... In the past,
Goku's tail suddenly grew back, too...

32
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,010
If he were to transform,
that would be a problem!

33
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,410
What?!

34
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,480
I got him! I got him!

35
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,790
T-Take that, you jackass! Ha-ha-ha on you!

36
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,170
How'dya like that?! Ain't no way
yer a match for Yajirobe<i>-sama</i>! Nyaah!

37
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,940
W-Why, you!

38
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,180
You filthy bastard!

39
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,200
S-S-Sorry 'bout that! Did it hurt?
I was just jokin' around. Did I cut ya?

40
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,000
That's right! I got lotsa
respect for ya! Lemme be your friend–

41
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,170
Y-Yajirobe...

42
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,380
<i>Nobody</i> inflicts a wound on
my body and gets away with it!

43
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,950
There's no way you're getting away with that!

44
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,990
Dammit!

45
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,390
G-Gohan... Gohan!

46
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,770
Gohan!

47
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,370
T-That's Father's voice...

48
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,710
Gohan, hear my voice...

49
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,980
Look at the ball of light in the sky...

50
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,590
B-Ball of light? Ball of light?

51
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,950
O-Oh, hell!

52
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,180
You think I'm going to allow that?!

53
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,980
Die!

54
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,420
Oh, no!

55
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,390
You brat! I'm not about to let you grow huge!

56
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,540
I-If I don't kill him right now–!

57
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,540
Gohan! It's up to you!

58
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,310
G-Gohan is becoming a Great Ape...
I-It's an all-or-nothing gamble...

59
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,390
T-That's right! His tail! In my panic,
I forgot the most important thing!

60
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,190
If I can just cut off his tail!

61
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,370
G-Gohan...

62
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,170
B-But when Goku turned Great Ape,
he lost virtually all of his rationality!

63
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,200
What about Gohan?

64
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,390
Gohan is the same! T-That makes sense.

65
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,390
It's not so much that Goku
and Gohan lose their rationality,

66
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:34,020
as it is that when they become Great Apes,
they revert to being ferocious Saiyans!

67
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:47,410
Hey! Stay back!

68
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:56,420
Gohan!

69
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,190
G-Gohan!

70
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,420
W-What happened to him?

71
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,270
G-Gohan...

72
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,870
The Saiyan!

73
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,400
Get the Saiyan!

74
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,380
You idiot! Don't provoke him!

75
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,230
W-Why, you!

76
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,570
Gohan!

77
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,570
T-The look in his eye is different.

78
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:57,580
Gohan! Get the Saiyan!

79
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:07,890
Great! There's still a little bit of
Gohan's mind left in there. S-Sure...

80
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,590
He's half earthling!

81
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,400
T-The moon I created
won't go out for another hour...

82
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,380
I'll just have to cut off his tail!

83
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,460
What a freak. And after
he's taken all that damage, too.

84
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,370
Is this guy immortal?

85
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,700
D-Damn! My power!

86
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,050
Dammit!

87
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,090
I-I can't move!

88
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,470
W-What happened?

89
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,650
D-Did he get him?

90
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,230
Is he <i>still</i> alive?

91
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,260
What a monster!

92
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,200
T-The only things left in the city
appear to be these two strange spheres.

93
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,040
Does that mean that these
are the Saiyans' spaceships?

94
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,070
What's that?

95
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,880
I-It's flying!

96
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,030
W-What's that?

97
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,870
I-It's here...

98
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,900
T-To think that I would have to withdraw...

99
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:01,010
D-Damn...

100
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,620
Me, Vegeta<i>-sama</i>, known as the
mightiest warrior in the universe...

101
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,750
How disgraceful...

102
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:13,160
T-That's his spaceship...
Y-You're not about to get away...

103
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,470
Kuririn! Use my katana!

104
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:42,020
W-We've come this far...
I'm going to finish him off...

105
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,280
Hold it!

106
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:16,020
T-This is for everyone that you killed...

107
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,820
Say your prayers!

108
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,830
Dammit! M-My body won't respond!

109
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,770
You did well to come this far.

110
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,770
I wasn't sure how this would turn out.
It's wrong for me to play favorites,

111
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:40,040
but that Saiyan is a villain that has
plunged the whole universe into terror.

112
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,650
I can't help it.

113
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,850
Although, this will not
completely weed out the root of evil.

114
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,490
No, not the root of evil...

115
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,260
Die!

116
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,690
Wait!

117
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,670
G-Goku?

118
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:14,210
Goku, was that you
who just spoke into my mind?

119
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,820
Yeah, it was...
I can't talk very loud, and all...

120
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:25,620
K-Kuririn, forgive me, but let him get away...

121
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,060
Let him <i>what</i>? A-Are you crazy?

122
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:34,430
P-Please... T-This is the only
thing I'll ever ask for myself...

123
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:38,440
But Goku, this is the
guy that killed our friends,

124
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,840
and tried to kill everyone else in the world!

125
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,210
If we let him go now, he's certain to
recover his strength, and come back here!

126
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,750
Y-You're probably right...

127
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:57,560
If you're thinking that maybe he'll
have a change of heart, the way Piccolo did,

128
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,430
then you're greatly mistaken!
He's not that kind of guy!

129
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:09,230
I know that... and I know that
Vegeta there has incredible strength...

130
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:13,040
S-Still... I ain't able to say this too well...

131
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:20,650
but when I saw him nearly
dead there, I thought to myself...

132
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,050
"What a waste."

133
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,980
What a waste?

134
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:35,060
After training at Kaio-sama's place,
I thought I had reached my pinnacle...

135
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,430
But that Vegeta guy there
has done far better than I have...

136
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:46,640
It surprised me...
To be honest, I was overwhelmed...

137
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:53,580
But somewhere within my heart,
I was happy, and excited...

138
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,950
That must be because I'm a Saiyan too...

139
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,250
Whenever I see an amazing
guy like that, my heart leaps...

140
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:12,800
I want to train even
more, and fight him again...

141
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:19,970
This is the guy who killed
Yamucha<i>-san</i>, Tenshinhan, and Chaozu!

142
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:27,140
I know it's not the right thing to do...
but please... grant me my selfish request...

143
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:33,060
Let me have... another chance to fight him!

144
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,150
All right. You've got the right
to ask for something for yourself.

145
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,980
It's thanks to you that we even
have the Earth at all now, Goku.

146
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,050
But remember, Goku...

147
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,160
Next time, you take him
down with devastating power!

148
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,890
Yeah, I sure will...

149
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,540
R-Remember this well, you trash...
There aren't going to be any more miracles...

150
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,550
Next time we meet, you're all dead!

151
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,460
Be sure to enjoy yourselves
to the fullest until then...

152
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,450
<i>For now, the danger of the</i>
<i>Earth's extinction has passed.</i>

153
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:17,290
<i>Or has it? And what is this</i>
<i>"root of evil" that Kaio spoke of?</i>

154
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

155
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,530
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

156
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

157
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

158
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,880
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

159
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

160
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

161
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

162
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

163
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

164
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,570
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

165
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,640
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

166
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,310
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

167
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>So sorry.</i>

168
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,580
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

169
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

170
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,510
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

171
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,910
<i>Kuririn, thanks to you guys,</i>
<i>I somehow managed to survive.</i>

172
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,080
<i>But the other guys and the</i>
<i>Dragon Balls are gone now.</i>

173
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,450
<i>If we're able to go to</i>
<i>this Planet Namek place,</i>

174
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,220
<i>we might be able to come by some Dragon Balls!</i>

175
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,090
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

176
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,920
<i>"We're Off Into Space! The Star</i>
<i>of Hope is Piccolo's Homeland."</i>

177
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,660
<i>Piccolo-san will come back to life!</i>

178
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,290
"Next time"
"We're Off Into Space! The Star
of Hope is Piccolo's Homeland"
