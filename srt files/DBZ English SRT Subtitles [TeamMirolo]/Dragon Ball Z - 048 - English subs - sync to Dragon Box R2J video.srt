3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:50,295
May I take care of all three of them?

17
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:52,205
Feel free.

18
00:02:56,645 --> 00:03:01,605
No! He was targeting the Scouters!

19
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:03,205
<i>Scouters?</i>

20
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:09,215
Those devices that can tell your
opponent's strength and location!

21
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:16,195
So that's it! Then they can't tell
precisely where the Dragon Balls are, after all!

22
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:17,395
Using those Scouter things,

23
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:20,795
they just searched out Namekians,
then forced them out of them!

24
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:25,795
That old man knew that, so that's
why he destroyed all of their Scouters!

25
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,965
<i>The Elder launched a surprise attack.</i>

26
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:35,005

27
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:41,845
I'll kill you all!

28
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:45,055
I'll kill each and every one of you!

29
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:57,905
<i>"Gohan in Peril!</i>
<i>A Pursuing Dodoria Summons Death."</i>

30
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:08,175
Elder!

31
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,615
Dodoria<i>-san</i>! Wait!

32
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:14,615
Begin by killing these three younger ones!

33
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,825
Dammit!

34
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:43,615
I'll dispose of all three
of you within ten seconds.

35
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:46,785
Don't be ridiculous! You think
you're a match for all three of us?!

36
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:52,555
Huh? Do <i>I</i> think I'm a match
for you? What an amusing joke.

37
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:54,255
What?!

38
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:02,165
Come on!

39
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,955
What?!

40
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:09,765
It's hopeless! He can't defeat
that guy with that kind of attack!

41
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:45,995
You now understand that it is
useless to try to defy us or run away, I trust.

42
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:48,595
In any case, come back down here, please.

43
00:06:54,115 --> 00:06:58,415
So you have finally grown
cooperative, I see. That will do.

44
00:06:59,955 --> 00:07:03,515
You have destroyed my precious Scouters.

45
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:08,125
May I have you produce your
Dragon Ball, by way of apology?

46
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:18,135
I have no choice. But
promise me that no matter what,

47
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:21,405
you will not lay a hand on the children!

48
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:33,945
Yes, yes, we ought to have done
it this way right from the beginning.

49
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:38,115
W-What monsters these guys are! How awful!

50
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:40,125
Why, those–!

51
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:44,555
H-Hey, Gohan! Don't go getting any funny ideas.

52
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:48,965
T-There's simply no way we
can stand up to those guys, okay?

53
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:29,135
Yow-ow-ow... With twenty times the
gravity, you get twenty times the pain!

54
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:56,025
Now, take this, and get out of here at once.

55
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,365
Well done.

56
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:03,675
While I am at it, let me also
have you tell me the locations

57
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:06,475
of the two remaining Dragon Balls.

58
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:08,075
Don't be ridiculous!

59
00:09:08,115 --> 00:09:14,115
We Namekians don't sell each
other out, even if it means our own lives!

60
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:21,925
Now, we had an agreement! Leave here at once!

61
00:09:21,965 --> 00:09:24,925
Oh dear, not you, too.

62
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:29,935
There is absolutely no one on this
planet who will speak about their friends.

63
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:34,065
I guess I will have to have
you die... along with the children!

64
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:38,945
W-What did you say?! Why, you–!

65
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:51,555
Elder! Elder!

66
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:55,925
This isn't what we agreed to!

67
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:59,425
You promised you wouldn't do anything
else if I handed over the Dragon Ball!

68
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:05,065
But unless I have all seven
Dragon Balls, it is meaningless, correct?

69
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:09,565
You have destroyed our Scouters,
so we will need to have you tell us

70
00:10:09,605 --> 00:10:12,135
where the remaining two are.

71
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:17,415
I told you, I'll tell you about
the others over my dead body!

72
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:24,885
Is that how badly you want to die?
In that case, I will do as you wish.

73
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,255
What?!

74
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:31,995
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, will we possibly be able to
search for the Dragon Balls without Scouters?

75
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:36,065
Kill all three of them.

76
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:37,895
Yes, sir.

77
00:10:37,935 --> 00:10:41,065
T-That's dirty!

78
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:44,505
You guys run! Run away!

79
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:45,635
Right!

80
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:51,845
I'll show you the pride of the Namekian people!

81
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:05,125
C-Cargot!

82
00:11:08,465 --> 00:11:10,525
Control yourself, Gohan!

83
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:19,275
Control yourself.
There's nothing we can do! Hey!

84
00:11:19,315 --> 00:11:23,755
Cargot! Cargot! Cargot!

85
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:30,745
You didn't even have a chance to
show us this "pride" of yours, huh?

86
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,425
It won't even be any fun
to smash a little kid like this.

87
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:58,615
Well, all the same, die!

88
00:13:00,515 --> 00:13:02,315
Stop!

89
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:15,865
Gohan!

90
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:25,665
What? Your buddies? Where?

91
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:47,525
Does that teach you?

92
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:55,465
W-Who the hell are you?!

93
00:13:56,835 --> 00:13:59,435
That idiot!

94
00:13:59,475 --> 00:14:03,435
I am going to take you down!

95
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,675
What did you say?

96
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:10,475
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

97
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:14,645
You dumbass! Run! Hurry!

98
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,485
Hurry!

99
00:14:16,525 --> 00:14:17,685
Right!

100
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:25,825
They do not appear to be Namekians, do they?

101
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,695
No, sir.

102
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:34,805
Damn it!

103
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:39,675
After them! Dodoria<i>-san</i>, catch them!

104
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:11,005
Gohan, fly as fast as you can!
If he catches us, we're finished!

105
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:12,445
Right!

106
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:20,645
Fools! Do you think you can escape?

107
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:32,625
It's no good! He's faster
than us! He'll overtake us!

108
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:47,475
They are quite fast, aren't they, Freeza<i>-sama</i>?

109
00:15:47,515 --> 00:15:51,045
They also seem to have more
battle power than the Namekians.

110
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:54,545
Who in the world could they be?

111
00:15:54,585 --> 00:16:00,995
In the way, to be sure.
That mountain is in the way, you see?

112
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:25,275
Now our visibility has
become much clearer, has it not?

113
00:16:43,035 --> 00:16:44,625
Huh?

114
00:17:27,015 --> 00:17:28,845
Gohan!

115
00:17:56,805 --> 00:17:58,905
Oh, crap!

116
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:02,785
Damn!

117
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,385
Dammit, let go of me! Let go of me, you!

118
00:18:34,245 --> 00:18:36,235
I'm not going to make it in time!

119
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:46,825
Gohan! Get out of here! Hurry! He's coming!

120
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:07,375
Damn, these sure are nimble little guys!

121
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:18,785
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, let's land and fight him!

122
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,125
We can't! He isn't the sort of foe we
can do anything against by fighting!

123
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,795
Just fly as hard as you can!

124
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:39,935
Damn, if this keeps up, we've
had it! I've got to do something!

125
00:19:39,975 --> 00:19:42,145
That's it! Gohan!

126
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:45,975
Gohan, from here on, don't look
in my direction! Close your eyes!

127
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,315
I have an idea. Got that?!

128
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,655
Right!

129
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:56,325
Take this!

130
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:59,665
<i>Taiyo-ken!</i>

131
00:20:09,905 --> 00:20:13,705
My eyes! My eyes!

132
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,275
My eyes!

133
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:19,345
I did it! It worked!

134
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:24,755
Why, you–! My eyes!

135
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:27,695
Gohan! Hide now, while we can!

136
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,095
Right!

137
00:20:41,405 --> 00:20:45,175
W-Why, you rotten–!

138
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:50,115
W-Where did you go, dammit?!

139
00:20:51,885 --> 00:20:57,055
Where are you?! Where the hell did you go?!

140
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,995
Come on out, dammit!

141
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:18,705
W-What did you do, Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

142
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:23,405
Oh, I just blinded him a little bit.

143
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:55,045
It's okay. He doesn't have
his Scouter anymore, after all.

144
00:22:00,215 --> 00:22:08,285
<i>However, will they indeed be able to</i>
<i>escape the hands of this brutal pursuer?</i>

145
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:48,195
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

146
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:54,035
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

147
00:22:54,075 --> 00:22:56,405
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

148
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:04,905
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

149
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:11,415
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

150
00:23:11,455 --> 00:23:15,525
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

151
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:18,995
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

152
00:23:19,035 --> 00:23:21,665
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

153
00:23:23,405 --> 00:23:29,205
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

154
00:23:31,415 --> 00:23:33,275
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

155
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:35,075
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

156
