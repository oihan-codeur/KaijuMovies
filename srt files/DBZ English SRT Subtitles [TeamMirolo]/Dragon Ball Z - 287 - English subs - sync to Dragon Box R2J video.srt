00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,780
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,370
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,130
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,020
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,770
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,280
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,120
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,660
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,660
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,340
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,220
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,090
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,680
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,680
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,060
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,270
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,110
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,900
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,200
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,880
This time, get reborn as a good guy!

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,470
I want to fight you,
one-on-one. I'll be waiting for you!

25
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:12,020
And I will have gotten much, much better!

26
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,100
See you later!

27
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,560
<i>The long, long fight was over.</i>

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
<i>At last, Majin Boo, with literally</i>
<i>not even a single cell left behind,</i>

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,730
<i>had been completely vaporized.</i>

30
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,990
<i>"Peace Returns!!</i>
<i>Majin Boo, Champion of Justice!?"</i>

31
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,920
They did it! They did it!

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,840
They did it!

33
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,060
Son Goku!

34
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,700
What do you think?

35
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,470
Apparently, it went well. Majin
Boo's <i>ki</i> has completely disappeared.

36
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,720
They did it!

37
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,640
They did it! They did it!

38
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,470
Father...!

39
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,700
D-Did you get him?

40
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,630
M-Majin Boo?

41
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,170
You got him, huh?

42
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,900
People of Earth! Do you hear me?

43
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,730
It's the combat sport
world champion, Mister Satan!

44
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:11,360
With you people's cooperation,
the dreadful Majin Boo has just now died!

45
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,580
You can relax! You have
been released from terror!

46
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,540
Satan!

47
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,170
Satan, you really are Number One!

48
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,710
Way to go! You're our hero, Mister Satan!

49
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,920
Satan!

50
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:37,930
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

51
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,940
Enough already, Papa!

52
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,940
In any case, they did it!

53
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,280
Just what you'd expect from Goku and Vegeta!

54
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,490
Vegeta! I love you!

55
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,000
So you're safe too, then?

56
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,260
Goku-<i>san</i>!

57
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,020
Even this heavy-duty Kaioshin
Realm, it seems, was quite ravaged.

58
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,740
Dende, go heal Vegeta's injuries first.

59
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,740
He's especially worn out.

60
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,410
Right.

61
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,810
Do you get it? We're saved!

62
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,810
What is it?

63
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,190
Hey! Where are you going?

64
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,490
Thank you!

65
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,140
B-Boo!

66
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,810
What?!

67
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,570
H-He's still alive! P-Please, heal him!

68
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,940
You can heal him, right?
With that mysterious power?

69
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:07,710
Don't be ridiculous! You have to be joking!

70
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,540
Move! I'm going to finish him off!

71
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,170
S-Stop! Please stop!
H-He's not all that bad a guy!

72
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:19,550
He was just ordered around by bad
people, that's why he did what he did!

73
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,640
Why, you... Don't you get it?!

74
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,140
What do you intend to do if he gives
rise to that devastating Boo again?!

75
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,310
W-Well, in that case...

76
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,110
Next time for sure, the world
will probably come to an end!

77
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,150
Killing him now while
we can is for the best!

78
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,150
You got that?!

79
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:42,740
W-What made him become evil was
when that idiotic guy killed this dog!

80
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,290
P-Please! I beg you!

81
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,710
I will take responsibility for him, and
keep him under my protection at my home!

82
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,130
Protection?! Don't make me laugh!

83
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,050
With your power, what the hell can you do?!

84
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,550
Get out of the way, now!
Or do you want to die with him?!

85
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,600
W-Why, you...!

86
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,070
Dende, heal Boo for me, would you?

87
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,740
What did you say?!

88
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,160
Are you out of your mind?

89
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,750
Aw, it's all right, ain't it Vegeta?

90
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,120
Both this Boo and Mister Satan did well by us.

91
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,960
If these two hadn't been here,
we would have all had it.

92
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,800
Right?

93
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,520
Besides that, if the worst happens,
we can just fight him again.

94
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,070
Let's train so that one-on-one,
we won't lose to him next time!

95
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:04,490
B-But, it will be awkward to have
him living together with you on Earth.

96
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,080
The Earthlings all have the terror
of Boo burned into their memories.

97
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,540
Oh, well, if Boo can put up with
not going out for about half a year,

98
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,960
the Dragon Balls will be re-activated,
and if we ask Shen Long,

99
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,050
we can have him erase all memories
of Boo from everybody on Earth!

100
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:26,050
My, my, not the Dragon Balls again.

101
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:29,220
Well, that's the deal, Vegeta.

102
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:33,060
Do what you want! Whatever
happens is no concern of mine!

103
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,640
Th-Thank you!

104
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,650
Really, thank you!

105
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,270
Okay, Dende, if you would.

106
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:39,900
Right!

107
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,240
So, once Boo is better, let's
all go back to Earth together!

108
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,530
Once I've eaten all I can,
I want to get plenty of sleep!

109
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,750
<i>And so, Goku and the others</i>
<i>finally returned to Earth.</i>

110
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,440
Everyone!

111
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:29,740
<i>And then, they enjoyed a wistful</i>
<i>reunion with their families and friends.</i>

112
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:06,030
<i>Of course, there was one</i>
<i>among them who was not welcomed.</i>

113
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,750
You'll have to excuse me for
being away for so long, everybody.

114
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:20,710
I received the Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s
life, so I've come back to life.

115
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,460
D-Does that mean...
you can live together with us?

116
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,550
With Gohan and Goten, a family of four?

117
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,760
Yeah! I want to hurry and
go back to Mt. Paozu, Chichi,

118
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,760
and chow down on
some of your home cooking!

119
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,530
<i>And then, a half-year later...</i>

120
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,510
And then, a half-year later...

121
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,720
As Goku promised, using the
power of a revived Shen Long,

122
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,600
people's memories of Boo were erased.

123
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,810
I'm not giving you this!

124
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,640
This is mine!

125
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,310
That one's yours? Then, where's mine?

126
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,310
They sell them over there.

127
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:15,740
Oh, there's so much here, isn't there?

128
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,330
Welcome!

129
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:22,330
Vanilla, choco, strawberry–we have
all kinds! Which would you like?

130
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,960
Let's see... Everything!

131
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,890
H-Hold on! I still haven't gotten your money!

132
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,890
What is money?

133
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,100
What? Stop kidding around!

134
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,820
If you don't have any
money, then give that back!

135
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,230
Give me back my ice!

136
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:54,650
If you want it so badly,
come back with some money!

137
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,590
Satan said it's not good to get angry.

138
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,300
Who is this guy?

139
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:26,600
Money... money... ice... ice... money... ice...

140
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,530
Come on, come on! If you can
skillfully defeat this gentleman,

141
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,330
you will receive a great deal of money!

142
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,910
All of one hundred thousand Zeni!

143
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:49,670
How about it? Do we have
any courageous challengers?

144
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,800
The cost to fight is a mere ten
thousand Zeni! Come on, fight! Fight!

145
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,800
You go on!

146
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,640
Don't be stupid! He's a master of kung fu!

147
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,890
There's no way I can beat him, you know!

148
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,890
Can I really get a great deal of money?

149
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,190
Of course! That is, if you can fight me and win.

150
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,310
Do you want to go, mister?

151
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:14,900
But Satan said it isn't good to fight!

152
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,900
Is he a student of Satan's or something?

153
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,330
–He must be!
–Really?!

154
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,330
Don't worry. This is only a game.

155
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,920
Oh, it's just a game?!

156
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,670
All right! If you need money, I'll put it up!

157
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,210
It's a cheap price to pay to
watch an interesting match like this!

158
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,890
<i>If he's Satan's student, then</i>
<i>I don't need to pull any punches!</i>

159
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,890
Money... ice... money... ice...

160
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,940
Here goes!

161
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,360
How could you be Satan's student?

162
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,780
Ice... money... ice... money...

163
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,040
Money... ice... money...

164
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
B-Boss!

165
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,590
Boss! Shake it off!

166
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,890
Ice!

167
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:26,890
Here! I brought you money!

168
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,100
Ice... ice...

169
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:41,320
Wait, sir! Your change! Your change!

170
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,950
Aw, how annoying already!
You still need something?

171
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,830
No. Nothing at all.

172
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:14,150
Really! Where have you been?!
You're always suddenly disappearing!

173
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,730
Come on, carry my bags!

174
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:22,490
Of all the... Vegeta could at least
go shopping with me, couldn't he?

175
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,860
Sending Boo along instead is the worst!

176
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,710
Come quickly!

177
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,210
How pretty!

178
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,720
I believe this one would
best suit you, madam...

179
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,480
You're right! Fine, I'll take them all!

180
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,060
A-All of them?

181
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,480
Right! All of them!

182
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,730
Are these really that yummy?

183
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,570
You just keep quiet!

184
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,740
All right! All of you, hands up!

185
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,240
Get your hands up!

186
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,580
Now look, you! I am in a very bad mood today!

187
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,580
Why, you! You wanna die?!

188
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,290
Boss! Outside, outside!

189
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,130
Boss!

190
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:31,140
You idiot! We've got hostages here!
There's nothing to get nervous about!

191
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,850
Nuh, nuh, nuh! One of
those hostages is Majin Boo!

192
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,150
You guys sure are out of luck!

193
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:47,280
M-Majin Boo?! Who's that?!
Where is this guy?! Bring him here, now!

194
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,660
Yucky.

195
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,080
I don't care if he's Majin Boo, or Pee, or
whatever, once he takes this, he's done for!

196
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,670
B-Boss, Boss!

197
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,670
What is it?! What a nuisance!

198
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,330
That.

199
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:10,640
You're good guys! You gave me money for ice!

200
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,640
Stay back! Stay back!

201
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,980
I'll give you this back.

202
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:29,490
Th-That was a gunshot!
W-We can't wait any longer!

203
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,070
Captain!

204
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:34,490
Oh! The Great Saiyaman!

205
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,500
Please, leave the rest up to us!

206
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,540
We'll leave it to you!

207
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,080
So long as there is evil in this world...!

208
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,670
The wrath of justice will burn...!

209
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,510
Great Saiyaman No. 1...

210
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,630
...and No. 2...

211
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,590
...can be counted on to...!

212
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,730
We're sorry. We're turning ourselves in.

213
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,590
This is what's it's like to have a family.

214
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,970
Fusion Ha!!

215
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,480
Now it's my turn!

216
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:48,650
You fool! That's dirty,
using Fusion! All right, then...!

217
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,900
Aah! J-Just a minute!

218
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:16,140
See here, now! What are
you doin', all in the raw?!

219
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,720
<i>The Earth has been saved.</i>

220
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,690
<i>Goku and the others enjoyed to the fullest</i>
<i>the peaceful days which had come once again.</i>

221
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,570
What vulgar folks!

222
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,870
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

223
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,410
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

224
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:56,010
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

225
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

226
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,110
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

227
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,490
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

228
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,370
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

229
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

230
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,960
<i>Even now?</i>

231
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,590
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

232
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:42,010
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

233
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:48,480
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

234
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:58,530
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

235
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,380
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

236
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,470
<i>Bulma was nice enough</i>
<i>to invite us over for a party.</i>

237
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,010
<i>Sorry, Chichi, but I'll be a little late.</i>

238
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,300
<i>You make sure to come!</i>

239
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,100
<i>Don't go fussin' over</i>
<i>those dinosaur eggs all day!</i>

240
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,980
<i>I'm sure everyone is lookin'</i>
<i>forward to seein' you, Goku-sa.</i>

241
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,020
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

242
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,070
<i>"You're Late, Goku! Everyone Party!!"</i>

243
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,980
<i>The Dragon Ball Family all in one place!</i>

244
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,610
"Next time"
"You're Late, Goku! Everyone Party!!"
