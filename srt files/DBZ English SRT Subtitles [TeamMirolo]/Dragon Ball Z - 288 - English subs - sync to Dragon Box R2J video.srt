This one, maybe?

31
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,810
Nope, this one after all, I think...

32
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:40,560
I wonder what kind of clothes
they're wearin' in the city now.

33
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,570
That's perfect on you, Gohan!

34
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,070
Mother, do I really need to go in this outfit...?

35
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,450
What are you talkin' about?
We're goin' to the city!

36
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,450
Oh, well...

37
00:03:55,490 --> 00:04:01,540
How many years has it been since
we've gone to the city? I'm so excited!

38
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,880
Say, Gohan, which one do
you think is better lookin'?

39
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,720
We may be going to the city, but
it's only to Bulma-<i>san</i>'s house, right?

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,720
We're going to go eat barbecue!

41
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,140
Gohan!

42
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,730
Do you know where my lipstick is?

43
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,150
Mother, you have lipstick?

44
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,900
I got some before, from Bulma-<i>san.</i>

45
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,580
The same goes for some paint-like
stuff for spreadin' over your eyes.

46
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,700
I don't know anything about
them. Don't know, don't know...

47
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,540
I must have packed
them away somewhere...

48
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,710
By the way, has Goku-<i>sa</i> finished gettin' ready?

49
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,710
Huh? He was here until just a moment ago.

50
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,050
I wonder where he went.

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,970
You don't think...?

52
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,150
There's one missing!

53
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:12,160
Ah, is that where it is?

54
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,990
All right...

55
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,140
W-What's the matter?!

56
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,140
I was just trying to return
it to the nest, you know!

57
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,810
There!

58
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,360
But if the egg hatches in a place like this,

59
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,530
the child is going to fall off the cliff!

60
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,660
He went to see some eggs, you say?

61
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:02,120
Why does he have to go see those
dinosaur eggs again at a time like this?!

62
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,500
He said they looked like
they were going to hatch today,

63
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,540
so he was just going to
go see how they were doing.

64
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,130
Mother!

65
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,590
He's not in the vicinity.

66
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,140
Shall I go look over on the
other side of the mountain?

67
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,140
I've had it! We're goin' with just us!

68
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,730
Good grief, that Goku-<i>sa</i> is never
around at important times like this!

69
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,810
He's always gettin' himself left behind!

70
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,730
It's not my fault if he whines about it later!

71
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,690
Really, at times like this...!

72
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,580
I don't think that reinforcing
it that way is going to hold.

73
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,710
Okay! You're saying you want
to do this all yourself, right?

74
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,630
These are your first children, after all!

75
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,510
Now then, I'd better get back soon,
or Chichi is going to get angry at me.

76
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,860
You can't have these!

77
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,820
Sorry about this.

78
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,170
I can't leave them alone like this...

79
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,140
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

80
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,140
Oh, Trunks! You've gotten
a little bigger, haven't you?

81
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,020
Aw, gee... Come on in!

82
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,120
Hey, Trunks! Thanks for stopping us!

83
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,540
I had a bit too much speed going.

84
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,710
Yamucha, is this yours?

85
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,170
Yeah, Kuririn!

86
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,000
This is the latest model
our company makes!

87
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,720
Actually, I asked Bulma to
have them make it cheaper for me.

88
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,720
How nice! Maybe I'll ask her too.

89
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,140
Hey, Chichi!

90
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,140
Good day!

91
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:31,560
Yeah, you're all looking well.

92
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,150
Huh? Where's Goku?

93
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,150
Uh, about that...

94
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,570
He said he couldn't come, because
there are cute babies of his to be born!

95
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,240
Hey, what does she mean, babies?

96
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,160
Don't tell me...!

97
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,490
I-I'll explain everything later.

98
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,310
Thanks!

99
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,270
Look at that, look at that...!

100
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,720
You're sure it's okay for
Kami-<i>sama</i> to go to parties?

101
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
It's fine, once in a while, isn't it?

102
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
Here.

103
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,560
Thanks.

104
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,060
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

105
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,730
Is this where you've been? It's been too long.

106
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,660
<i>Come to think of it, I was found by Gramps</i>
<i>over in a bamboo thicket on this mountain.</i>

107
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,210
<i>Around there, I think,</i>
<i>is where I was picked up...</i>

108
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,570
<i>Gramps sure was strict...</i>

109
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,380
<i>Even so, Gramps was also kind.</i>

110
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,610
Gramps...

111
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,680
Hey, hey, hey!

112
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,890
Sorry, but if you're going to fight,
could you do it over there?

113
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,490
All right, fight!

114
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,470
Let's dance!

115
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,250
Gohan, dance your heart out!

116
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,720
What are you doin', Gohan?!

117
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,890
I'll show you the secret to how it's done!

118
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,160
Awesome, awesome!

119
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,710
Goten, your mom is incredibly cool, huh?

120
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,170
Big Brother, did you know?

121
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,760
Mm-hmm... I knew that mother was
a master of the Eternal Turtle style,

122
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,470
but this is the first time
I've ever seen her do it.

123
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:59,720
That's right! Gohan-<i>kun</i>, you and
the others hadn't been born yet, huh?

124
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,640
Chichi-<i>san</i> once even entered the
Tenkaichi Tournament, you know!

125
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,730
Are you okay, Mother?

126
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,160
Sure enough, you can't win out against age.

127
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,120
Incredible! Just what you'd
expect of Goku-<i>san</i>'s wife!

128
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,660
Goku?

129
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,800
Goku sure is late.

130
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,560
I wonder if Son-<i>kun</i>
isn't going to come after all.

131
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,730
Are you that concerned about it?

132
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:52,650
Ah! So that's it, Bulma-<i>san</i>!
You like Goku-<i>sa</i>, don't you?

133
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,450
You'd best give up on him!
I'm far and away prettier, after all.

134
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,170
Indeed! You're very pretty today, Chichi-<i>san</i>!

135
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:09,670
That makes it sound like
I'm usually not pretty, doesn't it?

136
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,130
Somehow, I feel sorry for Chichi-<i>san.</i>

137
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,380
He'll come, that's for sure.

138
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,660
What, you guys were
worried and came to watch too?

139
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,580
I'd like to relocate that egg to a safer place,

140
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,550
but it's gotten so weak that if I move
it at all, it looks like it might break.

141
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,550
Damn...

142
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,600
Okay, wait here. I'll be right back!

143
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,790
Hang in there for bit until I'm
finished with that nest up there!

144
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,660
I'm going to reinforce
that with this right now!

145
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,680
Whew, that was close!

146
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,560
Your egg is all right!

147
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:46,150
Well, let's keep going!

148
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:50,490
Well now, the rain has stopped, and
it's about time we were going home.

149
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,080
Okay then, we'll see you later.

150
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,080
Mm-hmm. Be careful, okay?

151
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,830
Don't be a stranger.

152
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,080
Goku!

153
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,500
–Son-<i>kun</i>!
–Goku!

154
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,090
Father!

155
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:03,670
Goku!

156
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:07,050
Hey, sorry, sorry I'm here so late.

157
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,470
–Where's Chichi...?
–I'm right here!

158
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:16,640
What do you mean by moseyin' on in
here now? Everyone's gettin' ready to leave!

159
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,520
Yeah, I meant to come right
back, but you see... Forgive me!

160
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,650
Well, it's not like this is the first time, huh?

161
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,490
If I were to get upset over every little thing,
I could never be Goku-<i>sa</i>'s wife, could I?

162
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,490
Have you eaten yet?

163
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,500
No, not yet.

164
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,580
For cryin' out loud! For a husband,
you sure need lookin' after!

165
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,500
I'll go fix you somethin'.

166
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,500
Bulma-<i>san</i>, would you help me?

167
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,130
Of course!

168
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,970
So? So? Were they born?

169
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,550
Yeah.

170
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,970
Tell us the story of these eggs!

171
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:58,390
Right. They were incredibly
cute babies, four of them!

172
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,970
They're born!

173
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,070
Tell me, tell me, compared to when I was
born, which one of us was more adorable?

174
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:58,950
Which, you ask? I was dead
when you were born, Goten, so...

175
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,590
Hey, Vegeta!

176
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,590
Don't just stand over there,
you come on over here too!

177
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,560
<i>Just by him being there,</i>
<i>everything around Goku is livelier.</i>

178
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,690
<i>everyone has more fun.</i>

179
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,730
<i>Sure enough, you are Number One, Son Goku!</i>

180
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,870
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

181
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,410
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

182
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:56,010
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

183
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

184
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,110
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

185
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,490
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

186
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,370
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

187
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

188
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,960
<i>Even now?</i>

189
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,590
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

190
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:42,010
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

191
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:48,480
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

192
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:58,530
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

193
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:15,880
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

194
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,470
<i>It's been ten years, huh?</i>
<i>It looks like someone I'm interested in</i>

195
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,600
<i>will be entering the Tenkaichi Tournament,</i>

196
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,140
<i>so I've decided to enter too,</i>
<i>along with my granddaughter, Pan.</i>

197
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,770
<i>Huh?! Pan-chan is still</i>
<i>just a four-year-old girl!</i>

198
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,860
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

199
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,030
<i>"Grandpa Goku! I Am Pan!!"</i>

200
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,320
<i>Who is it that Father could be interested in?</i>

201
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,610
"Next time"
"Grandpa Goku! I Am Pan!!"
