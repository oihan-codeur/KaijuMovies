<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:52,655
Damn it all!

17
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:08,435
<i>Planet Namek has been destroyed.</i>

18
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,235
They say the Namek Dragon Balls

19
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:15,245
can bring people back to
life any number of times!

20
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:18,615
In other words, both Son<i>-kun</i> and
Kuririn can be brought back to life!

21
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:28,555
It is you folks that don't know anything.

22
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:32,555
Goku and Kuririn will
return to life on Planet Namek.

23
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:35,095
However, Namek is no longer there,

24
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,895
it's just the vacuum of space.

25
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:41,775
The moment they return to life,
death awaits them again.

26
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:57,655
<i>"Son Goku Survived –</i>
<i>The Z Warriors All Resurrected!!"</i>

27
00:03:06,135 --> 00:03:11,695
W-Why is it Father and
Kuririn<i>-san</i> cannot come back to life?

28
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:13,205
It appears to be okay if, like Chaozu<i>-kun,</i>

29
00:03:13,245 --> 00:03:19,035
your body is regenerated by Kami<i>-sama</i>
and you're at Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s place.

30
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:23,045
Otherwise, it seems you return
to life at the place where you died.

31
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:27,715
But Son<i>-kun</i> and Kuririn
died on Planet Namek,

32
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:32,715
and Planet Namek isn't there any more,
right? There's just the emptiness of space.

33
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,885
On top of that, Kaio<i>-sama</i>
doesn't appear to have jurisdiction

34
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,055
over the area of Planet Namek's location.

35
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,435
I-It can't be...

36
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:49,105
How about using your heads a little bit?

37
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:52,875
I don't know about spirits or whatever,

38
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:56,715
but you can always bring them back to
life after moving them here to Earth, right?

39
00:03:56,755 --> 00:03:58,375
Probably, anyhow.

40
00:03:58,415 --> 00:04:00,545
That's it! Just like he said!

41
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:03,425
You say some pretty good things, don't you?

42
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,925
Thanks a lot!

43
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:18,105
Don't get carried away!

44
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:25,905
<i>All I want to do is see for myself</i>
<i>Kakarrot's strength as a Super Saiyan.</i>

45
00:04:25,945 --> 00:04:30,345
<i>And then, sometime,</i>
<i>I will defeat him! That's for sure!</i>

46
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:33,415
Pardon me, madam of Earth.

47
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:36,555
Once the Namek Dragon Balls reactivate,

48
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:41,055
we intend to locate a suitable
planet and then relocate ourselves there.

49
00:04:41,095 --> 00:04:46,395
Would you please direct us to a nice
place where we can stay until that time?

50
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:48,065
I guess you're right.

51
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:50,735
In that case, you can come live at my place!

52
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:52,735
Are you sure that is all right?

53
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,705
It's awfully big, so don't worry!

54
00:04:54,745 --> 00:05:01,245
Besides, for our part, we'd like to trouble
you to use the Dragon Balls a little bit more.

55
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,475
Just do it, okay?

56
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:04,745
Okay, Dende<i>-kun</i>?

57
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,245
Y-Yeah...

58
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,745
With so many of you here,
if you were found out by anyone,

59
00:05:08,785 --> 00:05:11,755
there would be a big fuss over you!

60
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:16,295
That's certainly true.
We accept your kind assistance.

61
00:05:16,335 --> 00:05:20,065
And um, Vegeta<i>-kun</i>, wasn't it?

62
00:05:20,105 --> 00:05:22,065
Vegeta<i>-kun</i>?!

63
00:05:22,105 --> 00:05:23,895
Why don't you come too?

64
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:26,735
After all, you don't
have any rent money, right?

65
00:05:26,775 --> 00:05:28,735
I'll provide plenty of food!

66
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:33,075
You must be like Son<i>-kun,</i>
and eat an awful lot, I bet!

67
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:36,415
However, no matter how
attractive you might say that I am,

68
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:38,745
you can't do anything naughty!

69
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:41,415
W-What a vulgar woman!

70
00:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,755
To say that with such a loud voice!

71
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:46,255
Okay, everyone! Wait just a moment.

72
00:05:46,295 --> 00:05:49,425
I'll go hunt down a telephone
and have my dad come get us.

73
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,755
A-Ahem, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

74
00:05:52,795 --> 00:05:56,435
Could I stay over at
your place too, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

75
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,935
Gohan<i>-kun</i>, you have a home, don't you?

76
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:00,265
You should go home!

77
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:03,535
Your mother must be worried and all!

78
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:06,035
See, that is...

79
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:11,245
I forgot to do my homework,
and Mother will be angry at me...

80
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:29,565
The repairs to the spaceship
are complete, this time for sure.

81
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:35,605
Without fail, you will arrive on
Namek in five days. Are you all ready?

82
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,905
Gohan, sit tight!

83
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:43,375
Your Ma is comin' to save you!

84
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:45,715
And so, the countdown...

85
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:49,045
4... 3... 2...

86
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:51,715
1...

87
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:55,385
Ah, that's right! A moment ago,
I got a phone call from Bulma.

88
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:59,125
She says everyone has returned to Earth.

89
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:03,805
As such, are you still going after all?

90
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,845
Can't you speed this
thing up any more?! Huh?!

91
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,715
T-This is it...

92
00:07:18,455 --> 00:07:22,085
He's here! He's here! Down here!

93
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,115
Here, here, here!

94
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:35,765
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

95
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:40,105
Where is he?! Gohan<i>-chan</i>?!

96
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,005
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

97
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,405
Mother, I'm home...

98
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:51,745
<i>And so, the Namekians were carried</i>

99
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:56,915
<i>to the Capsule Corporation,</i>
<i>which is run by Bulma's father.</i>

100
00:07:56,955 --> 00:08:01,955
This is my home. What do you
think? A pretty cool place, huh?

101
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:05,255
My, my! How good of you to come!

102
00:08:05,295 --> 00:08:07,395
Is this gentleman your boyfriend, Bulma?

103
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:10,735
What a handsome young man, and so trendy!

104
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:13,435
T-Trendy?

105
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:16,105
Is that...?

106
00:08:19,785 --> 00:08:22,245
This is a space capsule that I repaired.

107
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:24,575
The fourth time around, it's perfect.

108
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:28,115
However, I still haven't decided
where to place the stereo.

109
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:36,455
So that's it. It's the thing
Kakarrot came in.

110
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:40,765
Vegeta<i>-san</i>! I've prepared something cold.

111
00:08:40,805 --> 00:08:43,465
Come drink with everyone else!

112
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:46,765
<i>As it turns out, the Namekians would live</i>

113
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:52,475
<i>at Bulma's home until</i>
<i>the Dragon Balls reactivated.</i>

114
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:07,425
<i>And so, in no time at all, 130 days had passed.</i>

115
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:28,075
The Namek Dragon Balls
reactivate in 130 days, then?

116
00:09:28,115 --> 00:09:32,715
That's correct. On Planet Namek,
one year is 130 days, you see.

117
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:34,885
Compared to Earth, that's one-third!

118
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:36,385
Isn't that nice?

119
00:09:36,425 --> 00:09:39,385
Let's make our request of
Super Shen Long<i>-san</i> right away!

120
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:40,885
J-Just a moment!

121
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:43,395
Gohan and the others aren't here yet...

122
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:45,765
Hey, wait a second!

123
00:09:46,435 --> 00:09:48,395
Hey, Gohan!

124
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:51,735
Pardon us! My Juku school ran long!

125
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:55,065
Are you going to Juku again? Such hard work!

126
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:58,235
I want to have my
Gohan<i>-chan</i> studyin' a whole lot,

127
00:09:58,275 --> 00:10:02,075
and have him become a great scholar!

128
00:10:02,115 --> 00:10:04,415
Well, we were just about to begin!

129
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,745
Okay, Dende<i>-kun</i>, if you would?

130
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,275
Right!

131
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:21,255
So this is the home-grown Shen Long?

132
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:23,595
Wow, this is incredible!

133
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,125
Indeed!

134
00:11:26,635 --> 00:11:30,125
–It suddenly got dark!
–What's happening?!

135
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:35,465
What's that?!

136
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:43,205
It's a monster!

137
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:47,715
Wait, wait! It's coming out of
Dr. Briefs' Capsule Corporation!

138
00:11:47,755 --> 00:11:49,885
It must just be some new invention!

139
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:52,085
Oh, is that it?

140
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:07,635
Everybody, this is an experiment
of the Capsule Corporation!

141
00:12:07,675 --> 00:12:11,115
Please, do not worry!

142
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:16,775
–What a surprise!
–Thank goodness.

143
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:24,055
Thou who hast gathered
the seven Dragon Balls,

144
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:29,555
I shall grant thee any three wishes.

145
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:33,725
Ladies and gentlemen of Earth,
next time will be fine with us.

146
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:37,565
Have your own wishes granted!

147
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:41,065
Thank you very much, Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

148
00:12:41,105 --> 00:12:42,905
In that case, I'll make our wishes.

149
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:48,435
First, please call the spirits of Son Goku
and Kuririn, who died on Planet Namek, here.

150
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,785
Understood. I shall attempt it.

151
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:09,925
I have summoned the spirit of
the being named Kuririn here.

152
00:13:09,965 --> 00:13:16,235
However, I canst not summon the
spirit of the one called Son Goku.

153
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,905
T-That can't be! Why not?!

154
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:25,445
Because Son Goku is alive,
I canst not summon only his spirit.

155
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:31,125
A-Alive...?

156
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,925
W-What's this?

157
00:13:33,965 --> 00:13:37,095
D-Don't tell me... how did he...?!

158
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:39,255
–Hooray!
–Hooray!

159
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,135
Hooray!

160
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:47,565
If he's alive, I wonder
why he hasn't come home.

161
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:51,235
His spaceship is probably
broken or something.

162
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:56,575
Well, if that's the case, you
can have Shen Long call him here!

163
00:13:56,615 --> 00:13:58,605
I-I guess so, huh?

164
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:02,745
Okay, now, the second wish!

165
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:05,955
Please return Kuririn back to life!

166
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:08,125
Go! Go! Go!

167
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:29,205
Huh?

168
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,875
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

169
00:14:31,915 --> 00:14:34,885
So that's it! I've come back to life!

170
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,755
Hooray!

171
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:44,555
I have returned his dismembered body to
its original state as a special free service.

172
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:49,095
You may have a frightening face,
but you sure do good work!

173
00:14:50,275 --> 00:14:53,235
And now, this time, at last...

174
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:56,565
Bring Son<i>-kun</i> here to us!

175
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:58,775
Hooray!

176
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:20,255
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

177
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:23,895
It is no good.

178
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:26,135
It hath been refused.

179
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:36,575
This man called Son says he shall
return shortly of his own accord.

180
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:39,245
R-Refused? Why?

181
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:40,915
I know!

182
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:42,915
He's afraid of his wife<i>-san</i>!

183
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:48,455
So the greatest in the universe is
the Super Saiyan Son Goku's wife, is it?!

184
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:53,895
J-Joke! That was a joke!

185
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:56,895
F-Father won't come home?

186
00:15:56,935 --> 00:16:00,935
He says he'll come back on his own shortly.

187
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:03,605
He's definitely coming home.

188
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,075
<i>So that's it!</i>

189
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:10,615
<i>He's gone to another planet, intending to</i>
<i>pile on more training and power up even more!</i>

190
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:14,105
<i>I can't just stay in a</i>
<i>place like this taking it easy!</i>

191
00:16:34,605 --> 00:16:36,765
My, my, my, my, my, my!

192
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,575
Pay him no mind!

193
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:45,575
Let's continue. Instead of Son, bring
back to life someone at Kaio's place.

194
00:16:45,615 --> 00:16:47,915
Yeah, okay.

195
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:49,945
I wonder who I should call back.

196
00:16:51,955 --> 00:16:56,255
They're saying they
want to call one of you back.

197
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:57,595
What do we do?

198
00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:01,295
I want to continue
training here a little longer.

199
00:17:01,335 --> 00:17:04,635
I-I want to be with Ten<i>-san.</i>

200
00:17:04,675 --> 00:17:08,135
Very well, Yamucha, you may go.

201
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,935
Me first, huh? Excuse me.

202
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:15,545
All right. Now then...

203
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:18,175
Bulma! Bulma!

204
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:22,545
Bulma, it's me. Do you know who?

205
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,215
Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

206
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:27,725
Tenshinhan and Chaozu
will stay here a little longer.

207
00:17:27,765 --> 00:17:30,555
Return Yamucha to life, if you would.

208
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,895
Yamucha, right? Okay!

209
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:36,065
And now, our third wish, once more please!

210
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:38,095
Bring Yamucha back to life!

211
00:17:41,605 --> 00:17:44,095
Very well, understood.

212
00:17:51,285 --> 00:17:55,585
I have returned the one
named Yamucha to life.

213
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:56,785
W-Where?

214
00:17:57,925 --> 00:18:00,415
Where? Where?!

215
00:18:01,295 --> 00:18:05,925
I have granted all of thy wishes. Farewell.

216
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,095
J-Just a minute, now!

217
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:33,585
He left! Where is Yamucha?!

218
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,455
H-Here!

219
00:18:44,575 --> 00:18:46,895
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!

220
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:49,905
–Yamucha<i>-sama</i>! Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!
–Pu-erh!

221
00:18:49,945 --> 00:18:51,435
Yamucha!

222
00:18:55,285 --> 00:18:56,905
As long as you were returning me anyway,

223
00:18:56,945 --> 00:19:00,115
I wish you had chosen a better place.

224
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:13,765
<i>And then, another 130 days passed.</i>

225
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:19,795
<i>With the first wish, Chaozu–</i>

226
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:28,775
<i>and with the second wish,</i>
<i>Tenshinhan was resurrected.</i>

227
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:36,775
Ten<i>-san...</i>

228
00:19:41,295 --> 00:19:43,255
Ten<i>-san</i>! Ten<i>-san</i>!

229
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:44,455
Chaozu!

230
00:19:51,975 --> 00:19:53,805
<i>And then...</i>

231
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:59,605
So, Dende, it is about time to take our leave.

232
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:00,945
Right.

233
00:20:00,985 --> 00:20:05,475
Everyone, thank you all so much!

234
00:20:08,585 --> 00:20:11,555
T-Take care, okay?

235
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:16,425
Gohan<i>-san</i>, goodbye. It was most enjoyable!

236
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:29,775
Dende...

237
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:37,785
I shall grant that wish!

238
00:20:57,605 --> 00:21:02,135
Goodbye.

239
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:07,105
Goodbye!

240
00:21:12,285 --> 00:21:14,445
G... G...

241
00:21:18,295 --> 00:21:20,125
Goodbye!

242
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:37,445
<i>With the third wish, the Namekians</i>
<i>transferred themselves to another planet.</i>

243
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,465
Let's see...

244
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:26,585
<i>And after this manner, the</i>
<i>Earth was peaceful for a short time.</i>

245
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,615
<i>However...</i>

246
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:48,645
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

247

<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

248

<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

249

<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

251

<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

252

<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:45,235
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

259
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,405
<i>So sorry.</i>
