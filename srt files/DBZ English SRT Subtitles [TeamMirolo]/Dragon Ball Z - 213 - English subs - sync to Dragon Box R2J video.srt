You know, he's an incredible little boy, huh?

38
00:03:56,865 --> 00:04:01,585
I don't suppose even the great
Mister Satan can stand waiting for this!

39
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:07,005
W-What if he decides to get serious on me?

40
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:09,425
Don't be silly!

I'm fine.

45
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:29,485
Really? Then, without further
ado, Mister Satan! If you please?

It's you, then?!

<i>If this is a dream, hurry and wake up!</i>

56

<i>This old guy is the World Champion?</i>

57
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:28,045
<i>I wouldn't believe it for a second.</i>

58
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,835
<i>I wonder if he's stronger than Dad.</i>

59
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,005
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, hang in there!

60
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,215
You keep that to yourself!

61
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,175
He doesn't have to hang in here!

62
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,265
Well, how about we start getting back?

63
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:46,895
I think the preliminaries should be over by now.

64
00:05:46,935 --> 00:05:49,815
You're right, let's go see.

65
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:51,235
Hold on!

66
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:54,235
That child down there is one of you, right?

67
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:57,235
He's about to fight with Mister Satan!

68
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,405
Aren't you going to watch that first?

69
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,615
Yeah! Yeah, we are!

70
00:06:00,655 --> 00:06:04,205
You never know, it may
turn out to be a good match.

71
00:06:04,245 --> 00:06:06,205
Well, we'll head out first, then.

72
00:06:50,205 --> 00:06:54,755
<i>What's this? There's</i>
<i>nothing incredible about that.</i>

73
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:58,215
<i>Could he be acting pathetic on purpose?</i>

74
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:01,805
<i>That must be it. He's the</i>
<i>World Champion, after all.</i>

75
00:07:01,845 --> 00:07:03,925
<i>Okay, let's do it.</i>

76
00:07:12,435 --> 00:07:15,655
H-Hey! What are you so worked up about?

77
00:07:15,695 --> 00:07:18,235
This match is just an attraction!

78
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:20,825
Th-This is supposed to be light fun!

79
00:07:20,865 --> 00:07:25,455
So let's take it easy here, okay? Huh? Yeah?

80
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:30,375
No way. I'm going as hard as I can.

81
00:07:33,415 --> 00:07:37,545
Y-You fool! Let's be grown up
about this. We're just playing around!

82
00:07:37,585 --> 00:07:39,005
I'm a child.

83
00:07:39,045 --> 00:07:44,225
Stubborn boy! Give it a break,
you're acting like a kid.

84
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,265
I am a kid.

85
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:52,225
So, are you both ready, then?
Let's get this underway.

86
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,275
That kid is uncommonly strong,

87
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:58,815
but overall, Satan has to be even stronger, huh?

88
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:02,195
He's gotta be. He's the
one who beat Cell, after all.

89
00:08:02,235 --> 00:08:05,405
Trunks! Go! Go!

90
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:09,165
<i>What should I do?!</i>

91
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:10,575
<i>I-I know!</i>

92
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:18,335
Oh! Mister Satan, what seems to be the trouble?

93
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,795
Mister Satan, what is it?

94
00:08:20,835 --> 00:08:27,345
Back when I fought Cell,
I hurt my knee, and now...

95
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:32,225
You hurt your knee during that fight?

96
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:35,605
Y-Yeah. I kept it a secret,
but in fact, that's what happened.

97
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:39,235
What a shame, that at a time like this...

98
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:41,575
There's a doctor here, we'll have him look at it.

99
00:08:41,615 --> 00:08:43,825
I'll go get him.

100
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:48,785
No, it's okay. It seems to be
better now. I should be able to fight.

101
00:08:48,825 --> 00:08:53,705
After all, I am the World Champion.
This is nothing at all.

102
00:08:53,745 --> 00:08:55,295
You're sure it's all right?

103
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:56,715
Of course!

104
00:08:56,755 --> 00:09:00,625
It's all right! Mister Satan will fight!

105
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:11,185
<i>W-We're about to start.</i>
<i>What can I do? What can I do?</i>

106
00:09:11,225 --> 00:09:15,685
<i>If I lose to a kid, my</i>
<i>reputation will be damaged...</i>

107
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:19,565
<i>That's it! My opponent is a kid!</i>

108
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:21,775
<i>I can just pretend to lose to him on purpose!</i>

109
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:24,195
<i>That's good! That's what I'll do!</i>

110
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:25,365
So, then...

111
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:27,445
T-Time out a second!

112
00:09:28,825 --> 00:09:33,125
Trunks-kun, listen. Come to
think of it, we never showed you how

113
00:09:33,165 --> 00:09:36,795
the special salute for
this attraction is to be held.

114
00:09:36,835 --> 00:09:38,165
Salute?

115
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:41,545
That's right! When the match starts,

116
00:09:41,585 --> 00:09:48,225
you will first gently, gently now,
tap me, the Champion, on the face.

117
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,305
It will be perfect.

118
00:09:50,345 --> 00:09:53,305
Just like this. Got that?

119
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:56,355
No matter what, you mustn't
salute me as hard as you can.

120
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:58,735
Okay? You got that?

121
00:09:58,775 --> 00:10:02,315
I got it. Just a tap, right?

122
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:08,655
All right. We can begin now.

123
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:11,035
The boy just wanted my autograph,

124
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:14,705
and I was telling him we'd do it afterward.

125
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:17,455
Ah, I see.

126
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:20,375
This will be interesting.

127
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:24,755
Well then, the match between the Junior
Champion Trunks-<i>kun</i> and Mister Satan!

128
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:27,175
Please begin!

129
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:31,675
All right! So, bring it on!

130
00:10:47,235 --> 00:10:53,365
Oh? Mister Satan has stuck out his face,

131
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:59,085
as if to say "Hit me!" Such poise!
Such poise, Mister Satan!

132
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,795
Way to go! Good luck, kid!

133
00:11:39,575 --> 00:11:43,715
P-P-Papa!

134
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:47,545
You idiot! You've got to pull
your punch more than that!

135
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:16,615
Papa...

136
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:43,515
You got me! You sure are strong.
The old man has lost!

137
00:12:44,855 --> 00:12:49,565
R-Ringout! What's this? Trunks-<i>kun</i> has won!

138
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,565
Hey, he did that on purpose!

139
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,575
That's our Satan!

140
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:56,495
Nice going, World Champion!

141
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:07,585
That was nicely done.
A very convincing show of losing!

142
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:11,835
W-Well, I think I'll take a short
nap in the waiting room now.

143
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:20,515
<i>I-I don't know. Maybe he was strong after all.</i>

144
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:39,155
Ow!! I'm going to die!! You stupid brat!

145
00:13:39,195 --> 00:13:41,785
And after I said to him
"gently!"Worthless dimwit!

146
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:43,625
Congratulations, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

147
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:47,205
You're even stronger than the World Champion!

148
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:54,795
And now, before we start the
Tenkaichi Tournament's Senior Division,

149
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:58,925
we will take a 30-minute intermission.

150
00:13:58,965 --> 00:14:03,145
The Senior Division will
convene at 1:40 p.m., so until then,

151
00:14:03,185 --> 00:14:06,145
we hope you look forward to it...

152
00:14:06,185 --> 00:14:09,735
Oh, there's an intermission?

153
00:14:09,775 --> 00:14:13,695
I'm hungry, why don't we
eat something before then?

154
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:25,165
Ah, excuse me, only contestants who
have qualified may proceed past this point.

155
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:27,545
You mean the results of the
preliminaries are out already?

156
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:32,755
In that case, I think each
one of us have qualified.

157
00:14:32,795 --> 00:14:36,755
One moment, please. May I have your names?

158
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,595
Son Goku.

159
00:14:38,635 --> 00:14:39,595
Kuririn.

160
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,175
No. 18.

161
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,185
Vegeta.

162
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:45,185
Ma Junior.

163
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,765
Ma Junior?

164
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:48,815
There was that business in the past.

165
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:51,775
It would be unfavorable if I went by "Piccolo."

166
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:53,775
I guess so.

167
00:14:53,815 --> 00:15:00,535
Here you are, here you are.
Please excuse me, you have all qualified.

168
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:01,785
By all means, you may proceed.

169
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:05,125
At 1:30, there will be a drawing
to determine your match order,

170
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,535
so until then, you are at your leisure.

171
00:15:06,575 --> 00:15:10,085
Half-past one, huh?
That gives us about 20 minutes.

172
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:16,545
Yeah, but aside from our little
membership here and Gohan,

173
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,215
there doesn't seem to be
anyone worth worrying about.

174
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,885
We'll be taking all the prize money.

175
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:24,135
I got no way to use it over in the Other World.

176
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:28,935
How nice for you, Goku, not
getting any older in the Other World.

177
00:15:28,975 --> 00:15:31,645
I suppose. Kuririn, you want to try dying?

178
00:15:31,685 --> 00:15:33,195
Now cut that out!

179
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:36,155
I'm extremely happy now, you know.

180
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:37,565
Right?

181
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,445
Idiot.

182
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:44,745
Congratulations on your victory.
You sure were strong, Trunks-<i>kun.</i>

183
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:48,325
What kind of training have
you been up to, little boy?

184
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:53,835
It's a shame the TV cameras were all
broken and we couldn't broadcast, huh?

185
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:59,295
Who would you like to communicate your joy to?

186
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,675
What are your impressions,
having fought against Mister Satan?

187
00:16:02,715 --> 00:16:06,685
Ah! Mister Satan is coming!

188
00:16:06,725 --> 00:16:08,345
Goten!

189
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:17,445
Trunks-<i>kun</i>! Can we have a word
concerning your impressions of victory?

190
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:29,205
Man, they were persistent.

191
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:34,545
Yeah. Say, Trunks-<i>kun</i>, are you
really going to give me those toys?

192
00:16:34,585 --> 00:16:37,125
Yeah, of course.

193
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:40,385
But still, there's something unsatisfying, huh?

194
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:45,135
Say, Goten, don't you want to
try getting in to the adult matches?

195
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:48,765
Mm? Sure I do...

196
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:09,825
Ohh! Yum, yum!

197
00:17:17,545 --> 00:17:22,095
Hey, you sure you're all right,
eating that much before the matches?

198
00:17:22,135 --> 00:17:25,845
Since when do the dead
get hungry to begin with?

199
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:29,935
Over in the Other World, it doesn't
matter whether you eat or not.

200
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:32,845
But the food here in the
lower realm is so yummy!

201
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:36,105
Ah, here you are!

202
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:40,105
Oh, Gohan! How did it go?

203
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:43,655
Trunks-<i>kun</i> won.

204
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:48,365
Mister Satan-<i>san</i> seemed
to lose to him on purpose.

205
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:52,875
Hmm, right, on purpose.
He thinks of everything.

206
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:54,915
What do you mean by that?

207
00:17:54,955 --> 00:17:57,995
Don't pay it too much mind.

208
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:00,465
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

209
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:04,885
–Please don't be so indiscreet!
–Ok...

210
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:13,185
Gohan! We've ordered for
you too. You're eating, ain't you?

211
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,935
Gotcha. Yes! I humbly accept!

212
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,665
Quite delicious, this food!

213
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:35,745
Ain't it? Another helping!

214
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:38,955
<i>What is it with these people?</i>

215
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:43,505
Unbelievable. What is it about
you Saiyans and your stomachs?

216
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:44,925
Saiyans?

217
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:46,505
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

218
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:50,515
Gotcha, gotcha! I won't say anything else!

219
00:18:52,475 --> 00:18:55,845
I'm full! I'm full! Thanks for the hospitality!

220
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:03,855
The food on This Side is yummy indeed!

221
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:07,365
You didn't eat anything. Are you dieting?

222
00:19:08,825 --> 00:19:11,865
The drawing is just about to begin, isn't it?

223
00:19:53,285 --> 00:19:56,705
S-Say, that person is floating in mid-air.

224
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:07,425
Good day. You are Son Goku-<i>san</i>, are you not...?

225
00:20:07,465 --> 00:20:10,635
H-How did you know I was?

226
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:13,595
I have heard some rumors concerning you.

227
00:20:13,635 --> 00:20:17,765
I have wanted to try my
hand against you in a match.

228
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:25,855
I too have managed to qualify in
the preliminaries. If things go well,

229
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:29,905
I hope we may end up
competing against each other.

230
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:35,115
Of course, I do not believe
I have what it takes to win.

231
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:39,495
I would just like to know how strong you are.

232
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:55,805
By all means, if I could shake your hand...

233
00:20:55,845 --> 00:20:59,135
Mm? Ah, good to meet you.

234
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:18,405
I see. As the rumors said,
you possess a fine soul.

235
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,675
Well, if you will excuse me...

236
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:37,845
Who was that, Son?

237
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:40,845
I don't know.

238
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:49,145
But there's no mistaking
that we ain't the only ones

239
00:21:49,185 --> 00:21:51,855
who will have easy wins anymore.

240
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:58,405
You sure? He didn't appear all that great.

241
00:21:58,445 --> 00:22:02,665
I mean, to me, he just seemed
like a strange-looking fellow.

242
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:17,385
<i>A strange pair suddenly makes an appearance.</i>

243
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:21,515
<i>Who could these two be?</i>

244
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:27,355
<i>This Tenkaichi Tournament just</i>
<i>got a whole lot more interesting!</i>

245
00:22:34,315 --> 00:22:38,945
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

246
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:45,495
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

247
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:56,095
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

248
00:22:56,135 --> 00:23:02,175
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

249
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:09,185
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

250
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:14,565
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

251
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:18,445
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

252
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:27,495
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

253
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:29,045
<i>Even now?</i>

254
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:36,675
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

255
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:42,095
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

256
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:48,555
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

257
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:58,605
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

258
00:24:13,795 --> 00:24:15,875
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

259
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:18,635
<i>Those two's names are Shin and Kibit, huh?</i>

260
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:22,255
<i>I ain't ever heard those names</i>
<i>before. I wonder who they are.</i>

261
00:24:22,295 --> 00:24:25,475
<i>Hey, Goten, let's both take</i>
<i>the place of that masked guy,</i>

262
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:28,055
<i>and enter the adult matches!</i>

263
00:24:28,095 --> 00:24:29,895
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

264
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:33,685
<i>"Event Match-ups Decided!!</i>
<i>Let's Hurry and Hold the First Round."</i>

265
00:24:33,725 --> 00:24:38,485
<i>Looking closely, there sure are</i>
<i>some odd folks at this tournament.</i>

266
00:24:38,525 --> 00:24:39,695
"Next time"
"Event Match-ups Decided!!
Let's Hurry and Hold the First Round"
