a year's worth of training in just one day.

Enter.

<i>the worst situation of all came up!</i>

25
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,240
Where is Son Goku?

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,580
If you don't tell us, we
intend to force it out of you.

27
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,750
I see. Well, you can try.

28
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,370
There's an island over there
with no one on it. Let's do it there.

29
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:06,290
Dear, dear, you never learn.

30
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:33,530
<i>"The Gekiretsu Kodan That Split the Heavens!!</i>
<i>Piccolo vs. Artificial Human No. 17."</i>

Unless you say something,
I'll kill you for sure this time.

32
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,650
Got it?

33
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,330
It won't be as easy as it was last time.

34
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,230
It taxes my comprehension why
you would fight a battle you can't win.

35
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,850
Are you buying time?

36
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:51,440
Or is it that you're just a fool?!

37
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,290
So, if you're going to bring it, bring it!

38
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,220
Will you alone be the one fighting, No. 17?

39
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,720
Of course!

40
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,390
Someone the likes of you
naturally won't even be a match for me.

41
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,230
<i>Yes! If I have only one opponent,</i>
<i>something just might come of this!</i>

<i>If I can defeat either</i>
<i>No. 17 or No. 18,</i>

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:42,450
<i>I can prevent Cell from becoming his perfect form!</i>

44
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,480
Here we are so far away,

45
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,820
and yet it's as if he's raising
his <i>ki</i> right before our eyes!

46
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,650
A-Awesome!

47
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,110
To think it was this high!

48
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,070
No. This isn't anything!

49
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,830
Piccolo merged with Kami-<i>sama</i>
can raise his <i>ki</i> much, much higher!

50
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,830
This is just the beginning.

51
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,330
I-Is that true?

52
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,460
K-Kami-<i>sama</i>!

53
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,840
It's started! The one who's fighting is Piccolo!

54
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,220
Could his opponent be that Cell guy?

55
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,020
No, I can't feel his opponent's <i>ki.</i>

56
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,020
It's probably the Artificial Humans!

57
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,230
It can't be!

58
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,850
Piccolo-<i>san</i> will be killed!

59
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,150
There ain't no use in going!

60
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,480
Our levels differ too much right now!

61
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,440
Do you want to weigh him down?!

62
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,660
Very soon, Vegeta and Trunks
will come out all powered up!

63
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,580
Wait until then, it'll be all right!

64
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,210
Besides which, Piccolo has become
a master like you couldn't believe!

65
00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,290
Right! Kami-<i>sama</i> and
Piccolo are not easily beaten.

66
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,010
<i>Not yet, Vegeta?</i>

67
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,600
<i>Was it impossible to go</i>
<i>beyond Super Saiyan after all?</i>

68
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,670
How can this be?

69
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,260
That's not Piccolo!

70
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,470
What?!

71
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,310
A-Annoying pest!

72
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,860
You're not getting away!

73
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,080
What?!

74
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,450
Dear me...

75
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,510
Impossible! With my speed...!

76
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,430
It's impossible!

77
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,340
Get cocky with me, will you?

78
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,820
♪ My gentle, good little boy, ♪

79
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:37,700

80
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,660
Hey, he's finally fallen asleep.

81
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,240
Really? That's good.

82
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:51,540
So, how's your shutdown device coming along?

83
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,840
Ah, there's still a lot of hard work!

84
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,220
According to these plans,

85
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,220
there are several dozen
shutdown sensors all wired in here,

86
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,390
and unless you cut them all off at
the same time, it'll be meaningless.

87
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,020
You don't say.

88
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,600
Even if I can create all the
code it takes for the shutdown,

89
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,230
I still have to input it on all
the frequencies for each circuit.

90
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,820
It's making me feel faint.

91
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,870
Of all the...! What kind of thing
has Doctor Gero created here?!

92
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,960
There, there, there! There, there, there!

93
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,460
I want to cry too!

94
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,850
Brace yourself, you oversized-scumbag!

95
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,260
Take this!

96
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,710
How about this?!

97
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,240
He repelled it!

98
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,660
This certainly is much better than before!

99
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,210
It's quite entertaining of you, isn't it?!

100
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,210
He's half-playing.

101
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,720
He really is disingenuous, isn't he, No. 16?

102
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,400
W-Who the hell has the upper hand here?

103
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,240
Is it Piccolo? Or is it the Artificial Humans?

104
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,030
Hey, it has to be Piccolo!

105
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,410
Can anyone overcome such ferocious power?!

106
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,040
I'm not so sure.

107
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,250
Since we can't sense his opponent's power,

108
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:18,630
we'd better not get caught up in the excitement!

109
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,840
Yeah, the Artificial Humans
don't dissipate <i>ki</i>, after all...

110
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,810
What's the matter? Finished already?

111
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,240
Really! Enough, already!

112
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,160
No. 17, hurry up and put him away!

113
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,330
Or shall I take over?!

114
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,450
Don't be ridiculous!

115
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:55,410
You expect me to switch with
you during the part I enjoy most?!

116
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,960
You're the same way too, I bet.

117
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,630
I suppose so.

118
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,130
This isn't it at all.

119
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:07,090
This isn't yet my power, the greatest in history!

120
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,970
It isn't? Well, let me see it!

121
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,900
This again?

122
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,650
It's no use, no matter
how many times you do it!

123
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,660
You disappoint me!

124
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,870
Did you really think such a
technique would work against me??

125
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,880
Where the hell are you aiming?!

126
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,840
There's nowhere left for you to run!

127
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,250
This is as far as the greatest in history goes!

128
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,720
Go to hell!

129
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,020
W-What is it?!

130
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,030
A B-Barrier?!

131
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,000
Too bad.

132
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,170
That's a pity, isn't it?

133
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:30,670
Ha! I'm still just getting started!

134
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,210
Let's change locations.

135
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,010
Someone has destroyed the island, after all.

136
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,890
You have to take better care of nature!

137
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,160
This intense <i>ki</i> is that of
Piccolo, combined with Kami.

138
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,830
The opponent he would be
fighting at such a high power must be...

139
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,670
It could only be No. 17 and the others!

140
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,840
I've found you! This is good timing!!

141
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:23,810
I'm saved!

142
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,110
I'm coming now! You just wait!

143
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,650
My power is already even greater than yours!

144
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:43,830
<i>At last, Cell realizes where</i>
<i>No. 17 and the others are!</i>

145
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:10,440
<i>The situation deteriorates even further!</i>

146
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,810
<i>Goku, please hurry with your training!</i>

147
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,930
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

148
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:52,770

<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

149
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,150
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

150
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,610
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

151
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,120
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

156
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,980
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>
