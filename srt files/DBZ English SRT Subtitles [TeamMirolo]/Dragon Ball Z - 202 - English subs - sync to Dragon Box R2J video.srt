It still doesn't have enough punch, huh?
Maybe the previous one was better...

33
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,930
Big Brother, hang in there.

34
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,890
All right... how about this one?

35
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,640

That settles it.

42

Big Brother, that's so cool!

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,920
Gohan, did you come up with a good one?

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,510
Uh-huh. Leave it to me, Mother.

45
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,510
Still, it's about time you were gettin' to bed.

46
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,260
You'll oversleep tomorrow,
and be late for school.

47
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
It's okay, it's okay.

48
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,900
Waugh! I overslept!

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,610
Uh-oh. I'm going to be late!

50
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,490
Th-That girl saw me transform.

51
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,040
She knows that I am the Great Saiyaman.

52
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,510
What are you looking so miserable about?

53
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,680
The teacher isn't even here yet.

54
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,700
"Richo of Rosai was a young, erudite
man with a profound love of knowledge,

whose name had come up for a promotion.

56
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,540
"But he was a very self-dependent man,

57

who considered himself above
being a low-ranking public servant."

Okay then, next, Son Gohan, let's have you read.

59
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,210
Son Gohan?

60
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm screwed. There's absolutely
no doubt that girl saw me.

61
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,480
As long as she doesn't tell anyone else–

62
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,810
Son Gohan!

63
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,190
Son Gohan-<i>kun</i>, enough!
Go stand out in the hall.

64
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,570
Right.

65
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,340
I've had it.

66
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,840
"Even when the nearby mountains
and fields had been searched,

67
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,340
there was no sign of him.

68
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,510
"Afterward, there was not a single person
who knew what had happened to Richo."

69
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,050
Okay, next up, Angela-<i>kun.</i>

70

71

72
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,490
Angela-<i>kun</i>, you too?

73
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,240

75
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,960
And so... I... I...

76
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,840
I'll go out and stand.

77
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,850
Um...

78
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,060
Huh? You're...

79
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,320
<i>W-What's going on?</i>

80
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,620
Um... Gohan-<i>san</i>?

81
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,910
U-Uh...

82
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,500
My name is Angela.

83
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,670
N-Nice to meet you.

84
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,250
I know this is sudden,
but do you have a girlfriend?

85
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,840
N-No, not exactly...

86
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,260
There is someone, isn't there?

87
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,350
It's true! I knew it, there is someone!

88
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,720
Uh, hold on a minute, there.

89
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,350
W-What to do?

90
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:14,360
I know your secret.

91
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,900
So you do, after all?

92
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,490
Would you take me on a date?

93
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,360
A date?

94
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,450
I knew it! You have a girlfriend!

95
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,910
And here I thought we could keep
your secret between just the two of us!

96
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,370
A-All right, understood.

97
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,960
Really?

98
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:44,010
Yay! Yay! Okay then, tomorrow,
Sunday, let's go right out and have a date!

99
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,680
I'll be waiting for you at
10 o'clock at Satan Station.

100
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:01,910
Sure enough, that girl
knows that I'm Great Saiyaman.

101
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,240
And to make sure she
doesn't reveal my identity,

102
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,910
I have to make sure that
I don't hurt her feelings.

103
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,330
But come to think of it,
I've never been on a date before.

104
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,000
What should I do?

105
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,930
I'm home!

106
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,930
Ah, welcome back.

107
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,350
Um, Mother, I need to ask
you about something awkward.

108
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,480
How did your first date with Father go?

109
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,400
Huh? Oh dear, my boy.
What a thing to be askin' me!

110
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,780
Let's see... as I recall...

111
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,840
Okay, Goku-<i>sa</i>, today we're
goin' to have a good solid date.

112
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:07,470
But Chichi, I ain't ever had a date
before, so I don't know much about them.

113
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:13,690
Oh my goodness, Goku-<i>sa</i>! A date has
always been the most enjoyable thing

114
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,150
that a boy and a girl can do together.

115
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,650
The most enjoyable thing, huh?
I know what you mean.

116
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,610
Yes, I mean...

117
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,460
Yeah, this is really fun!

118
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,890
Goku-<i>sa</i>'s right jab from back then
is even now engraved upon my heart.

119
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,480
R-Really...?

120
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,050
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

121
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,600
Gohan-<i>san</i>, I'm impressed.
You really came, huh?

122
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,600
U-Um, so does this mean you
won't reveal my secret to anyone?

123
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,520
Huh?

124
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,520
I mean, it's not as though... ummm...

125
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,110
Huh? A m-m-movie?

126
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,650
I'm so happy!

127
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,530
Okay, let's go, let's go!

128
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,820
U-Uh... er...

129
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,040
All right, hurry up!

130
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,360
Ah! Gohan-<i>san</i>!

131
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,780
You're not interested in being with
me after all, are you? I'm going home!

132
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,210
I'm sorry! It's not like that!
It's not like that! It's not like that!

133
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,960
Excuse me...! Excuse me...! Please, excuse me...!

134
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,220
I'm sorry.

135
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,930
I'm really sorry about that.

136
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,850
Let's go to a coffee shop!

137
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,740
At a time like this, you should ask
the girl how many sugars she wants.

138
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,910
Is that right?

139
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,620
How many?

140
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,330
Thirteen.

141
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:29,210
12... 13...

142
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,050
Ah! Thank you!

143
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,060
You know, Gohan-<i>san,</i>

144
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,770
you'd never think it, just by looking at you.

145
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,770
I was so surprised when I saw you.

146
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,610
<i>She means the Great Saiyaman thing.</i>

147
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,860
Um, what do you think about it?

148
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,120
I think it's very cute.

149
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,910
Cute?

150
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,830
Gohan-<i>san</i>, is that what you always wear?

151
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,790
Oh, it's just in case something happens.

152
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,840
It is cute, all right!

153
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,640
So, please make sure to keep
it a secret from everyone, okay?

154
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,970
Uh-huh, I know.

155
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,230
Say, let's go to Satan Tower now.

156
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,890
Okay?

157
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,700
Fire! Fire!

158
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,210
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

159
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:07,650
Hey, I heard there are some folks
who couldn't get out in time on the roof!

160
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,850
Are you serious?

161
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,530
Videl-<i>san...</i>

162
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,410
Can't you get any closer?

163
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,160
It's no use, Videl-<i>san.</i>

164
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,210
I can't do any better, because of
the upward currents from the fire!

165
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,540
At this rate, those people will be...!

166
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,850
Hey, I can see a large water tank over there!

167
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,850
Can we do anything with that?

168
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,680
What do you mean, "do anything"?

169
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,480
I mean, use that water to
put out the fire, or something!

170
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,360
Even if you open the valve, the water
will just drain through the plumbing,

171
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,110
and won't extinguish anything.

172
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,650
However, there is a
valve which isn't hooked up.

173
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,790
If I open it, the water will come out, right?

174
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,040
Yes, and it will flood the roof,

175
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,620
but I doubt it will put out
the fire within the building.

176
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,880
That should at least buy us a little time.

177
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,630
Videl-<i>san</i>, you can't mean it!

178
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,840
It's all or nothing!

179
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,340
Videl-<i>san</i>!

180
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,640
Here it is.

181
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,720
Hot!

182
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,200
Gohan-<i>san</i>, where are you going?

183
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,780
I have to save the people on the roof!

184
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,790
But Gohan-<i>san</i>, you going up
there won't help anything, will it?

185
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,750
Huh? What are you talking about?

186
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,670
It's times like this when a
champion of justice is needed!

187
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,460
Hey, you! Watch out!

188
00:16:58,210 --> 00:16:59,840
Gohan-<i>san...</i>

189
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,550
It won't open...!

190
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:14,650
W-We're done for!

191
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,960
The Great Saiyaman appears!

192
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,090
Now then, make way.

193
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,760
All right...

194
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,520
W-We're saved!

195
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,630
And just then, he appeared.

196
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,100
Son Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

197
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,900
What are you doing here?

198
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,940
Er, nothing special.

199
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,070
Are you sure you're not hiding anything?

200
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:32,660
N-Not at all...!

201
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,260
Angela-<i>san...</i>

202
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
Gohan-<i>san</i>, how awful!

203
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:58,020
You do have a girlfriend after all, don't you?!

204
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:01,480
Videl-<i>san</i> is your girlfriend,
isn't she, Gohan-<i>san</i>?

205
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,950
That's why you paid no mind to
the danger and rushed into the fire!

206
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:13,120
Well, Videl-<i>san</i>, do you
know about that thing?

207
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,700
That thing?

208
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,290
Anything but that!

209
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,080
The truth about Gohan-<i>san</i> is...

210
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,340
The truth about Gohan-<i>san</i> is...

211
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,680
...he wears teddy-bear underpants.

212
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,730
Teddy-bear?

213
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,140
Underpants?

214
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,860
That's right. I saw it myself the other day.

215
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,490
I saw it myself, just the other day.

216
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,790
How cute...!

217
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,880
It was a teddy-bear!

218
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,720
And that's my secret?

219
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,220
That's right.

220
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,180
Then, you didn't see anything
on the rooftop yesterday?

221
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,850
What do you mean? I didn't
have my contacts in then,

222
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,520
so I could only see things
close by. Did something happen?

223
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,110
Teddy-bear underpants?

224
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,280
So that's the kind of taste you have, is it?

225
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,780
Well... those are what my
mother bought me by mistake,

226
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,120
and as it happened, all my
others were in the laundry–

227
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,080
I won't have anything more
to do with you, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

228
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:59,470
I suppose I really ought
to apologize to Angela-<i>san...</i>

229
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,650
I've liked you for a very long time.

230
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,320
I'll be waiting for you next
Sunday in front of Satan City Station.

231
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,170
<i>The Great Saiyaman's</i>
<i>identity had not been revealed.</i>

232
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,340
<i>However, has Videl become aware of something?</i>

233
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,970
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

234

238

239
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,470

240
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:27,560

243
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,120

249
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:24,370

250

251
