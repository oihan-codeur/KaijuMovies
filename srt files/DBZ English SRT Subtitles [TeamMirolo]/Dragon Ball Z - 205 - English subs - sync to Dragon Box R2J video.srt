1
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,600
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,230
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,940
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,570
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,870
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:54,590
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,210
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,090
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,930
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,510
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,520
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,520
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,190
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:20,070
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,910
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,530
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,540
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,910
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,080
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,920
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,760
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,010
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,830
<i>With Videl's help, the Great Saiyaman</i>
<i>rescued a baby monster from Musuka.</i>

24
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,670
Don't worry, Chibi.
Your father is just knocked out.

25
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,140
You can't hide it any longer.
The true identity of the Great Saiyaman...

26
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,850
...is you, Son Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

27
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:40,770
<i>At last, Videl had seen through to the true</i>
<i>identity of the Great Saiyaman–Gohan!</i>

28
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:47,700
<i>He was then pressured into</i>
<i>entering the Tenkaichi Tournament.</i>

29
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:02,500
<i>"Goku Returning to Life!?</i>
<i>Entry into the Tenkaichi Tournament!!"</i>

30
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,510
And so, the airplane that was
experiencing engine trouble

31
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,430
safely landed at Satan Airport.

32
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,060
Today, once again, the Great Saiyaman
has saved many precious lives.

33
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,520
Great Saiyaman, can we have a statement?

34
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,440
–Please!
–Please!

35
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,820
Saiyaman-<i>san</i>, what do you
think about the fuss being made

36
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,570
about you being the hero
to succeed Mister Satan?

37
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,990
Any thoughts concerning your exploits?

38
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,740
Please, any statement at all!

39
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,080
I guess I have no choice, huh?

40
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,930
From thievery to killing to hijacking,
from small things to big things,

41
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,050
if it is evil, I cannot let it stand!

42
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,890
Knight of love and justice, the Great Saiyaman!

43
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,100
That's who I am!

44
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,650
That's just too nerdy.

45
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,740
You're participating in the
upcoming Tenkaichi Tournament, huh?

46
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,740
Yes.

47
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:00,580
So, what made you decide to enter?

48
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:06,590
Well, actually, one of my classmates
is Mister Satan-<i>san</i>'s daughter...

49
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,420
Huh? Mister Satan?

50
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,590
Mister Satan is that guy
who was skittering about

51
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,430
during the fight with Cell, right?

52
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,930
The combat sports world champion?

53
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,770
Wow, so his daughter is one of your classmates.

54
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,480
Yeah, but even so, she's a pretty good girl.

55
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,940
Like me, she's the type that
can't leave bad guys alone.

56
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,950
But my transformation was exposed
by her, because of my voice and scars.

57
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,780
And so, she said that if I don't
enter the Tenkaichi Tournament,

58
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,410
she would reveal my true identity.

59
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:46,380
<i>That really is unsightly, Gohan-san.</i>
<i>You don't need to wear that thing.</i>

60
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,880
You're kind of clumsy when it
comes to that sort of thing, huh?

61
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,850
You may appear to be flying straight,

62
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:05,310
but you've still got that blood
you've inherited from your father.

63
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,520
So, now what?

64
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,820
Do you want me to refit the
helmet so it changes your voice?

65
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,120
No, it's not that. Apparently,
you can't wear helmets, protectors,

66
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,990
or that sort of equipment
at the Tenkaichi Tournament.

67
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:26,210
So I was wondering if there was something
that could take the place of this helmet.

68
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,050
So you're saying that you can't wear anything

69
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,210
that would greatly decrease any damage done?

70
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,720
That's no big deal, right?

71
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,350
In short, so long as no one
finds out that it's you, Gohan-<i>kun,</i>

72
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,390
that's all you need, right?

73
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,730
<i>I wonder if she means some new helmet.</i>

74
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,860
Indeed! I just needed to do
something as simple as this!

75
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,570
What do you think,
Trunks-<i>kun</i>? Pretty cool, huh?

76
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,370
No comment.

77
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,540
<i>I'm glad I didn't ask her to make me one.</i>

78
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,250
Then again, no matter how much you hold back,

79
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:13,550
it's going to be dull, knowing
that you're a shoe-in to win, huh?

80
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,590
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

81
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,930
This whatever-you-called-it
tournament–if you're entering, then I am too.

82
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,560
Back then, there was a huge
difference between our powers.

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,400
But what about now?

84
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
While you've been
jubilating over your peacetime,

85
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,400
I've been continuing my training.

86
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,950
Yeah. This guy doesn't do a lick of work.

87
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,200
Just like your father.

88
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,740
I wonder, don't Saiyans ever work?

89
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,210
Awesome! Father and
Gohan-<i>san</i> are going to fight?!

90
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,080
I'm entering, too!

91
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,420
Gohan!

92
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,720
F-Father...? That's Father's voice!

93
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,970
Son-<i>kun</i>?

94
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,970
Kakarrot...?

95
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,940
Father! It's you, isn't it?

96
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,560
That's right. It's been a
long time, huh everyone?

97
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,980
Have you been well, Father?

98
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,400
Who is it?

99
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,740
Yeah. Well, if you can call
this doing well, then I guess so.

100
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,870
I am dead, and all.

101
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,580
Really?! You're really going to be able
to come to the Tenkaichi Tournament?!

102
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:34,710
Yeah! If I ask Uranai Baba,
I can come back for one day.

103
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,680
I'm going to make that day, the
day of the Tenkaichi Tournament.

104
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,430
Gohan and Vegeta, you're entering, right?

105
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,890
I'm entering too!

106
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,970
Hooray! Banzai!

107
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,350
Who is it?

108
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,940
I'll be looking forward to this, Kakarrot.

109
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,230
Come prepared. I've improved considerably.

110
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,610
So have I, Vegeta. Bye now.
I'll see you at the Tenkaichi Tournament.

111
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,070
Great! This is starting to get interesting!

112
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,620
Great news, huh Gohan-<i>kun</i>?

113
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,870
You'll have to hurry and
tell your mother, Goten-<i>kun,</i>

114
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,040
and Kuririn and the others.

115
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,710
Right!

116
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,630
So, who was that?

117
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:20,670
That's right! Vegeta-<i>san</i>, you'll
have to wear a costume like this,

118
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,550
so your identity doesn't get revealed.

119
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,340
Y-You expect me to wear that?!

120
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,350
I don't particularly care if anyone does find out!

121
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,810
Okay, see you at the Tenkaichi Tournament!

122
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,360
I'm on my way to go tell everyone else!

123
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,570
Tell everyone I said hello!

124
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,400
Bye-bye!

125
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,750
I wonder whose voice that was earlier.

126
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,090
Father is coming back! He's coming back!

127
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,600
<i>I'll be able to see him after all this time!</i>

128
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,750
W-Whuzzat?

129
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,680
Hold it!

130
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,480
Who cares? Let her have it!

131
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,660
Get her! Get her! Get her!

132
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,540
Stop!

133
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,750
Look, Misters, you can't
go around doing bad things.

134
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:23,760
Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow...

135
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,510
W-Who are you?

136
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,720
Liberator of those who are captive...

137
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,890
helper of the weak and router of evil...

138
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,310
the warrior of justice... Great Saiya–

139
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,190
Yow-ow-ow-ow!

140
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,650
Hey, you! What did you do that for?!
Everything was going so well!

141
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,750
That take was academy award-winning material!

142
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,540
Cut! Cut! Cut!

143
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,680
You there! We can't have you just
jumping in front of the camera like that!

144
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,010
You mean.... me?

145
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,560
Of course I do! Who else could I mean?!

146
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,850
For crying out loud, you're not even a child,

147
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:21,980
and yet you're running around
pretending to be the Great Saiyaman?!

148
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,520
Pretending?

149
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,530
We've got no choice! Let's take it from the top!

150
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,400
Right.

151
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,530
What if we speed the timing
up just a little bit this time?

152
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,620
W-W-What?

153
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,770
Scene 153! Great Saiyaman's flying action!

154
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,230
Ah, this is a surprise.

155
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,020
I never expected that they'd be
shooting a Great Saiyaman movie.

156
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,650
Ready...!

157
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,570
No!!

158
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:14,570
I-I can't do this! Let me down!
I'm afraid of heights!

159
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,410
W-What do we do, Director?

160
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,410
W-What do we do?
We're already behind schedule as it is.

161
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,290
We've got to finish shooting
this scene today, no matter what!

162
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,420
What a pathetic Great Saiyaman!

163
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,050
What?

164
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,090
I mean, I was just thinking, if the
real Great Saiyaman were to see this,

165
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,050
that's probably what he'd say.

166
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,430
<i>That's it...!</i>

167
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,600
Director, if we were to use him...

168
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,480
What? Him?

169
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,940
We won't have to go to any trouble
dressing him up, for one thing.

170
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,950
W-Who would have ever thought
things would turn out like this?

171
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,580
Okay then, we're going
with the posturing scene!

172
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,790
Are you ready to pose?!

173
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,620
Y-Yes!

174
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,870
Scene 312, Ready...!

175
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,470
From thievery to killing to hijacking,
if it is evil, I cannot let it stand!

176
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,970
Cut!

177
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,970
No, no, no, no, no, no!
There's no way a hero of justice

178
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,180
would strike such embarrassing poses, is there?!

179
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,810
But...

180
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,650
Let's do this once again!

181
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,440
Warrior of love, justice, and freedom, Great–

182
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,610
Cut!

183
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,990
Once again!

184
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,450
Helper of the weak, router of evil...!

185
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:35,990
No!

186
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,620
Shrieks call out to me...!

187
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,620
No, no, no!

188
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,540
Officially sanctioned helmet wearer...!

189
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,450
No!

190
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,460
Hater of sins, not of sinners...!

191
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,000
No!

192
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,000
The G in "Great" stands for "Good"...!

193
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,000
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

194
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,420
I can't take this anymore! You are
nothing at all like the Great Saiyaman!

195
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,970
B-But this is really how...

196
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,220
Shut up! Criminy, forget
the transformation scene,

197
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,480
get ready to do your flying!

198
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
R-Right!

199
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,990
Oh, no! Is it already this late?!

200
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,030
I have to go tell everyone about Father.

201
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,950
All right, pause! Now, fly from there!

202
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:28,710
What are you so nervous about?!
There's no danger!

203
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,420
Fly yourself all-out from there! Ready?!

204
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,050
Yes!

205
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,090
All right, fly now!

206
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,050
I have to hurry this up a little.

207
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,260
Great, great! That's the way!

208
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,930
All right, cut, cut!

209
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,940
I'm out of time now, so you'll have to excuse me!

210
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,750
Y-You don't suppose that was the real...

211
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,130
...G-Great Saiyaman...?

212
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,430
Goku, too?! Really?!

213
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,310
This is Kuririn-<i>san</i>, who gave up fighting,

214
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,770
and also stopped shaving his head.

215
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,980
It's been a long time
since we've seen Goku, huh?

216
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,610
The Tenkaichi Tournament, eh?
Maybe I'll enter, too.

217
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,440
Let's enter together!

218
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,780
But then, if Goku and Vegeta are
entering, there's no way I can win.

219
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,870
Besides, what would my wife say?

220
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,340
There, there.

221
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,630
You really ought to enter!

222
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,010
I hear that there are prizes
all the way to fifth place!

223
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,720
How much prize money will there be?

224
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,020
Let's see...

225
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,020
first place is 10 million zenie,
2nd place is 5 million,

226
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:17,360
3rd place is 3 million, 4th place is
2 million, and 5th place is 1 million.

227
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:21,030
Enter yourself, Kuririn! I'm coming too!

228
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,030
1 million zenie! 1 million zenie!

229
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,620
Right? Enter, Kuririn!

230
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,620
Daddy, enter, enter!

231
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,630
Y-You're right. I guess I will enter!

232
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:37,710
I wonder if I should.

233
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,300
Hey, don't tell Piccolo.

234
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,640
The chances of me getting as far
as 5th place will be lower if you do.

235
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,640
Oh, I couldn't do that.

236
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,190
By the way, what are you wearing
that ridiculous, geeky outfit for?

237
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,070
What are you saying?! This is cool!

238
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,900
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, your fashion sense has grown dull.

239
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,610
Bye!

240
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,420
Is that so? That does indeed sound interesting.

241
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,420
Doesn't it?

242
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,760
All right, I think I'll enter.

243
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,090
Oh, good luck. Popo cheer for you.

244
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,600
Dende, what about you?

245
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,600
No, I'm not entering.

246
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,850
I'm not the fighting type of Namekian, after all.

247
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,440
By the way, Gohan, what the
hell is with that strange getup?

248
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,650
Not you too, Piccolo-<i>san</i>!
Don't you think this is cool?

249
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,780
I-I can't tell.

250
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,120
Popo either.

251
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,420
I don't know where
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i> and company are...

252
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,590
and I think Bulma-<i>san</i>
will contact Yamucha-<i>san...</i>

253
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,600
All that leaves is Mother and Goten.

254
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,640
I'll bet that Mother will be thrilled
that Father is coming back for one day!

255
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,440
And this will be the first time
Goten ever sees his father, huh?

256
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:25,490
Still, I wonder if Mother will allow me

257
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,990
to participate in the Tenkaichi Tournament.

258
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,290
For my part, as long as I'm
going to enter, I'd like to win.

259
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,170
For that to happen, I think I'll be in trouble

260
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,290
unless I take a break from school and train hard,

261
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,670
since I've gotten so soft.

262
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,300
Goku-<i>sa</i>'s comin' back from the Next
World for the Tenkaichi Tournament?!

263
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,850
Why didn't you tell me this big surprise sooner?!

264
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,810
Terrific!

265
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,900
Goten! You'll be able to see your pa for one day!

266
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,240
This is too much! I'm the
only one who's gotten older.

267
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,950
You don't get any older in the Next World, right?

268
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,950
I should have gone to a beauty salon!

269
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,370
Ah, how many years has
it been? Seven years, is it?

270
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,330
Ah, this is too much!

271
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,660
Really, he's comin' home, huh?

272
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:27,340
Um, Mother, I wonder if I could
enter as well–the Tenkaichi Tournament?

273
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,340
I'll get myself all gussied up–eh?

274
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:36,810
I-If I win, we can get 10 million zenie.
5 million for 2nd place.

275
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,810
10-10 million zenie?!

276
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,520
Enter yourself, Gohan-<i>chan</i>!
Together with Goku-<i>sa,</i>

277
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,740
you two could get
15 million zenie in prize money!

278
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,910
N-Not exactly, it's still not
definite that we would win.

279
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,740
No way! It's a sure thing that one of you will win!

280
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,740
B-But for me to do this,

281
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:59,250
I'd like to take a short
break from school to train...

282
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,750
Who cares?! Train!
You can always make it up later!

283
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:08,590
Wow, this is a blessin' from heaven!
Pa's fortune is runnin' out,

284
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,050
and I was worryin' about
what we were goin' to do!

285
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,770
Goten, will you help Big Brother
out in his training starting tomorrow?

286
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,730
Uh-huh.

287
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,140
I think for now, I'll turn Super Saiyan.

288
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,870
All right, shall we get started?

289
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,620
<i>Due to unexpected circumstances,</i>

290
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,630
<i>Gohan has come to enter</i>
<i>the Tenkaichi Tournament.</i>

291
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,460
<i>Having established that his</i>
<i>long-time friends will participate as well,</i>

292
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,880
<i>his spirits have been lifted.</i>

293
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,890
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

294
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,480
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

295
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:56,030
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

296
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,160
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

297
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:09,170
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

298
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,550
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

299
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,390
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

300
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:27,480
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

301
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,020
<i>Even now?</i>

302
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:36,650
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

303
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,030
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

304
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:48,540
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

305
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:58,590
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

306
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,650
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

307
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,030
<i>Whoo! Goten, you can turn Super Saiyan?</i>

308
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,950
<i>As small as you are, that's awesome!</i>

309
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,120
<i>Goten, don't go turnin' into</i>
