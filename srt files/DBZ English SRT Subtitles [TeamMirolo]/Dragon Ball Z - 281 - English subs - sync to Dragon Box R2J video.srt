<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:30,325
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:36,045
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:41,675
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:48,975
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:54,685
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,315
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,355 --> 00:01:00,195

<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,615
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,615
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,625
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:14,295
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,635
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:28,635
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:34,185
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:37,025
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:39,855
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:46,115
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:55,785 --> 00:02:01,255
<i>The final, decisive clash between</i>
<i>Goku and Majin Boo has become fierce.</i>

24
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:29,405
<i>Goku boldly challenged Boo, with</i>
<i>strength that taxes the imagination, to battle.</i>

25
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:34,495
<i>Seeing this, Vegeta learned</i>
<i>of Goku's true greatness.</i>

26
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:53,925
<i>Hang in there, Kakarrot!</i>
<i>You are Number One!</i>

27
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:07,485
<i>"Pull Through, Vegeta!!</i>
<i>One Life-Threatening Minute."</i>

28
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:41,975
Th-This is a considerably powerful dream!

29
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:44,565
Not again!

30
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:09,005
<i>Ka... me...</i>

31
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:13,385
<i>ha... me...</i>

32
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:15,385
<i>Ha</i>!!

33
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:35,485
Stupid punk! That was
a genuine <i>Kamehame-Ha.</i>

34
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:58,505
Th-The Kaioshin Realm...!
That holy region of the gods...!

35
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:03,555
Hey! Don't get so upset! This is a
crisis for the whole universe, you know!

36
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:07,015
At a time like this, can't you
overlook such a small thing?

37
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:11,565
You might call it a small thing...

38
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:14,185
Hang in there, Goku-<i>san</i>!

39
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:09,575
You truly are strong!
Even greater than I imagined.

40
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,955
Gonna kill you!

41
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:17,585
If I had known it was
going to turn out like this...

42
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:22,965
I should have finished you off for
good when I had become Vegetto.

43
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:27,305
But no matter what, I can't afford to lose!

44
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:09,975
Damn! My attacks ain't having
any effect on him at all any more!

45
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:12,225
What the hell's the matter?!

46
00:09:15,015 --> 00:09:17,605
Th-This is bad!

47
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:22,485
As a result of the fight being drawn out,
Goku is just about out of stamina!

48
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:32,785
How do you like this?!

49
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:49,845
Even with me repeatedly
attacking him at that level,

50
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:51,895
that bastard ain't lost any of his resilience!

51
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:54,355
He just immediately goes
back to being good as new!

52
00:09:54,395 --> 00:09:56,525
Kakarrot!

53
00:09:56,565 --> 00:10:02,355
What is it, Vegeta? You want to switch
in again? Let me go a little bit longer!

54
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:06,905
You've got no intention of switching
out again, so quit being so transparent!

55
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:10,905
You must know as well as I do
that even if I were to fight him again,

56
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:14,495
then never mind me not having any
chance of winning, I'd be killed in a second!

57
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:17,335
Er, no, that's not...

58
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,335
Hmph, don't bother trying to be gracious.

59
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:24,045
It's certainly the truth.
I learned well once I tried to fight him.

60
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:27,505
Boo there is strong–even more than I am.

61
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:32,145
And you, Kakarrot, are too!

62
00:10:32,185 --> 00:10:34,515
Vegeta...

63
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:39,895
Don't hold back for me, finish him off!
With your Super Saiyan 3 there,

64
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,525
if you gather as much <i>ki</i> as you can,

65
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:44,905
you should be able to
completely obliterate Boo!

66
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:48,405
Yeah... I've been thinking
of doing so for a while now,

67
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,945
but I just ain't had the chance.

68
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:57,245
Here I'm wanting to obliterate him, but I
have to gather <i>ki</i> for about a whole minute.

69
00:10:57,285 --> 00:11:00,295
One minute?

70
00:11:00,335 --> 00:11:02,585
Maybe I've been trying too much to look cool!

71
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,295
I thought things would go better than this!

72
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:08,925
Y-You were concerned over me?

73
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:12,265
That bastard... He could
return to normal in an instant,

74
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,305
but he's dragging it out on
purpose just for the fun of it!

75
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:18,355
Of all the... How infuriating!

76
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,355
One minute is enough, then?

77
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:29,485
If you have one minute, you can
gather enough <i>ki</i> to annihilate him, right?

78
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:32,955
Y-Yeah... If I had a minute, that is...

79
00:11:32,995 --> 00:11:34,495
All right!

80
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:37,285
I'll keep him in check somehow for one minute.

81
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:39,455
You start gathering <i>ki</i> immediately!

82
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,285
V-Vegeta...!

83
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:15,785
You're going to keep him in check, you say?

84
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:19,075
That's crazy! I told you that
it would take a whole minute

85
00:12:19,115 --> 00:12:22,375
in order to gather enough
<i>ki</i> to wipe him out, right?!

86
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:26,925
Is there any other way, Kakarrot?

87
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:30,135
Any other way to beat him?

88
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:33,925
W-Well...

89
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:39,395
In that case, stop your useless
worrying and hurry up and gather that <i>ki</i>!

90
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:44,605
I'll buy you that one minute.
I'll stake my pride on it.

91
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:52,735
Understood. I'm counting on you, Vegeta!

92
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:57,745
Listen, Vegeta, in your state,
you're already once dead.

93
00:12:57,785 --> 00:13:01,825
Do you know what happens to
that kind of guy if he dies again?

94
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,335
They vanish.

95
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:10,835
In both this world, and the
Other World, you will no longer exist.

96
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:20,015
Don't you die, Vegeta.

97
00:13:24,395 --> 00:13:27,065
Hmph. Mind your own business.

98
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,405
All right, here I go.

99
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:59,055
You piece of crap!!

100
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:08,265
Take this!

101
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,245
D-Do you hear something strange?

102
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:23,205
Not again!

103
00:14:32,965 --> 00:14:38,095
That's great! If we're lucky, he just
might keep up like this for one minute!

104
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:46,415
Damn!

105
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:48,205
Hang in there, Vegeta!

106
00:16:07,015 --> 00:16:11,515
One minute... If I can hold out for one minute...

107
00:17:06,035 --> 00:17:07,535
Vegeta!

108
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,075
Vegeta!

109
00:17:41,985 --> 00:17:43,905
Bastard...!

110
00:17:58,755 --> 00:18:02,925
Hey... Where do you think you're going...?

111
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:05,885
Vegeta!

112
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:16,185
We're... not finished... yet!

113
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:25,315
Are you thinking of running away?
You miserable coward!

114
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:30,405
Hurry up and come at me!
Come on, what's the matter?!

115
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:33,955
You're the mighty Majin Boo, right?

116
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:36,995
Or are you afraid of me?

117
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,805
<i>Big Bang...</i>

118
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:49,505
<i>...Attack</i>!!

119
00:18:53,725 --> 00:18:54,475
What?!

120
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:16,495
A little longer... Just a
little longer! Hang on, Vegeta!

121
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:56,325
What's so funny...?

122
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:17,095
Y-You can't kill me...
with a wimpy attack like that...!

123
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:19,395
I'm not lying...

124
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:24,935
After all, I'm already dead once!

125
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:32,235
Damned if I'm going to be
done away with by the likes of you!

126
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:39,745
I am the warrior Saiyan
people's prince... Vegeta!!

127
00:20:39,785 --> 00:20:44,755
This is bad! Vegeta really is
going to get killed for sure this time!

128
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:49,835
Dammit, what are you doing, Goku?!
One minute has already gone by, hasn't it?

129
00:20:53,095 --> 00:20:58,635
How can this be? It's been one minute...

130
00:21:00,305 --> 00:21:03,765
I can't wipe out Boo with only this much <i>ki</i>!

131
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:45,145
Die!

132
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,565
Die, die, die, die!

133
00:21:58,195 --> 00:22:01,995
D-Damn it all!

134
00:22:02,035 --> 00:22:06,035
I haven't gathered any <i>ki</i> at all!
What's going on?!

135
00:22:07,415 --> 00:22:11,295
<i>What in the world is the matter, Goku?</i>

136
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:18,095
<i>The only one who can save Vegeta now,</i>
<i>as well as the whole universe, is you!</i>

137
00:22:33,695 --> 00:22:38,275
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

138
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:44,865
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

139
00:22:49,085 --> 00:22:55,425
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

140
00:22:55,465 --> 00:23:01,555
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

141
00:23:01,595 --> 00:23:08,565
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

142
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:13,945
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

143
00:23:14,605 --> 00:23:17,775
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

144
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:26,875
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

145
00:23:26,915 --> 00:23:28,415
<i>Even now?</i>

146
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:36,045
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

147
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:41,425
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

148
00:23:41,465 --> 00:23:47,935
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

149
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:57,945
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

150
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:15,415
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

151
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,085
<i>Stop, Satan! Don't get involved!</i>

152
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:19,925
<i>There ain't no way you can stand up to him!</i>

153
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:22,885
<i>Oh, I'm sorry! I didn't mean any harm!</i>

154
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:27,805
<i>I just wanted to show off a little!</i>
<i>Please, just spare my life!</i>

155
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:29,935
