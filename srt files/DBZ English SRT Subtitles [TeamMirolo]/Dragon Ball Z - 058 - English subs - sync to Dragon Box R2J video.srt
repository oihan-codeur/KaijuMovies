5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

12

<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:37,125
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,945 --> 00:01:57,245
<i>Having stolen five Dragon Balls from Freeza,</i>

17
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:02,385
<i>Vegeta at last had defeated</i>
<i>Zarbon, who had been chasing after him,</i>

18
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:05,085
<i>following an intense life-and-death battle.</i>

19
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:16,965
<i>And then, with great apprehension,</i>
<i>the Dragon Ball which Kuririn...</i>

20
00:02:17,005 --> 00:02:20,305
<i>...had received from the</i>
<i>Grand Elder also went to Vegeta.</i>

21
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:22,235
You guys are lucky.

22
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,635
I'm in a good mood, since I have
now found all of the Dragon Balls.

23
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:30,575
Now I can rule the entire
universe, instead of Freeza!

24
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:33,175
I will obtain eternal life.

25
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:45,755
<i>Elsewhere, Gohan had discovered</i>
<i>the Si Xing Qiu Ball Vegeta had hidden,</i>

26
00:02:45,795 --> 00:02:47,795
<i>and was on his way back.</i>

27
00:02:49,635 --> 00:02:56,805
<i>"Freeza's Secret Weapon!</i>
<i>The Devilish Ginyu Special Corps."</i>

28
00:03:01,645 --> 00:03:06,945
K-Kuririn, you handed it over
pretty easily, considering, huh?

29
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:10,885
You had to work so hard
to get that Dragon Ball, too.

30
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:16,055
He said that was the last
Dragon Ball, so it's all over now.

31
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:20,895
If I hadn't handed it over, we
definitely would have gotten killed.

32
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:23,965
The fact that the two of
us are even alive like this...

33
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:25,935
...is nearly a miracle.

34
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:33,305
Besides, we're probably still
okay handing over that Dragon Ball.

35
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:35,975
I'm sure that the Dragon Ball
that Gohan went looking for...

36
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,745
...is the one that Vegeta hid
to keep that Freeza bastard

37
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:42,985
from gathering all seven of them.

38
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:47,085
That's right! Gohan<i>-kun</i> must
have found that Dragon Ball already,

39
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,595
and now he's heading back!

40
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:53,565
That means things aren't going
the way Vegeta had hoped, are they?

41
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:58,095
Mm-hmm. As long as Vegeta
doesn't find Gohan, they are.

42
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,625
He is late, is he not?

43
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:25,255
Y-Yes, sir!

44
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,065
It has been four hours.

45
00:04:28,105 --> 00:04:32,295
What could Zarbon<i>-san</i> be doing?

46
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:36,305
Seeing as how he has not returned,

47
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:37,935
he has either fled,

48
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,245
or he has been killed.

49
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:43,375
If I had known this would happen,

50
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,945
I should have brought the Ginyu
Special Corps from the start, huh?

51
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:49,585
Yes, sir! C-Concerning that,

52
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,925
according to a message we
just received from Planet Freeza,

53
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:57,595
preparations for the Ginyu Special
Corps' departure are complete.

54
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:01,435
Is that so? I look forward to it.

55
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:05,265
Now then...

56
00:05:06,645 --> 00:05:10,605
I have no need of cowardly men, like yourself.

57
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:12,805
Be gone.

58
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:31,585
Ginyu Special Corps, launch!

59
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:52,745
What exactly is happening on Planet Namek?!

60
00:07:19,975 --> 00:07:21,235
W-What's this?!

61
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:30,845
There's an enormous power
headed for Planet Namek.

62
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,615
Is it Goku?

63
00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:40,625
There are five of them. Is this...

64
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:43,325
...t-the Ginyu Special Corps?!

65
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,625
The Ginyu Special Corps?

66
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:53,105
Mm-hmm. They are the evil
overlord Freeza's special private squad.

67
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:05,015
The Ginyu Special Corps have always operated

68
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:10,545
in the shadows of
Freeza's rule over the universe.

69
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,525
I don't know about "Ginyu," or whatever,

70
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:23,265
but we'll put those guys
down "g-iny-ood" and hard!

71
00:08:23,305 --> 00:08:25,065
That was funny, that was funny!

72
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,905
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, how was that pun–?

73
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:42,755
Kaio<i>-sama...</i>

74
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:52,195
<i>The Ginyu Special Corps–</i>
<i>a fearsome squad of evil.</i>

75
00:08:52,235 --> 00:08:57,395
<i>Each one of their powers</i>
<i>might be higher than even Goku's.</i>

76
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:59,875
<i>And there are five of them.</i>

77
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:21,055
For some reason, it feels like my
body has suddenly become lighter.

78
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,895
All right, one more burst!

79
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:43,615
Something's coming from straight ahead!

80
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:45,745
It's a very strong <i>ki...</i>

81
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,755
Vegeta!

82
00:09:57,935 --> 00:10:00,925
All of a sudden, there's a
strong battle power in front of me...

83
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:09,275
<i>I have to mask my ki...</i>

84
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:15,375
The presence just disappeared. Impossible...

85
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:20,415
I'm sure it was around here.

86
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:32,625
<i>Vegeta! Hurry and get out of here!</i>

87
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:37,265
Who's there?! Come on out!

88
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:39,595
I know you're there!

89
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,765
If you don't show yourself at once,

90
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:44,605
I'm going to blow this whole area away!

91
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,805
<i>H-He wouldn't!</i>

92
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:51,575
What's the matter?! Huh?!

93
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:57,515
<i>All right, I wonder if I had better</i>
<i>jump out and fight Vegeta. But then...</i>

94
00:10:57,555 --> 00:11:01,925
<i>Gohan, there's no way we can</i>
<i>match up against Vegeta now.</i>

95
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:06,295
<i>I have to protect this precious</i>
<i>Dragon Ball at this point.</i>

96
00:11:13,975 --> 00:11:16,305
You don't intend to come out, huh?

97
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:26,945
All right... as you wish, I'll blow you away!

98
00:11:26,985 --> 00:11:28,475
<i>Rats!</i>

99
00:11:29,655 --> 00:11:30,955
W–

100
00:11:30,995 --> 00:11:33,155
Wait!

101
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:39,155
<i>Please, don't let him find this...</i>

102
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:45,265
I-It's me!

103
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:51,635
Kakarrot's son, huh?

104
00:12:27,045 --> 00:12:33,455
Kakarrot's son, huh? I thought
that perhaps it might be you.

105
00:12:36,725 --> 00:12:38,915
There were other Earthlings here.

106
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:42,125
You being here isn't all that surprising.

107
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,695
A Dragon Ball!

108
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,135
D-Don't tell me that's!

109
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:55,935
This? I got it as a present from
that bald-headed friend of yours.

110
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:01,605
Y-You... killed Kuririn<i>-san...</i> didn't you?!

111
00:13:01,645 --> 00:13:03,475
If you'd like me to,

112
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:08,285
I wouldn't mind going back
now and killing him for you.

113
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:09,615
Be grateful.

114
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:15,425
To celebrate me getting all of the
Dragon Balls together, I let him live.

115
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:20,755
A-All of the Dragon Balls?

116
00:13:29,005 --> 00:13:32,275
Hey, what's that you're holding in your hand?

117
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,975
T-This is a clock!

118
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,745
Heh, a clock?

119
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:40,645
With science that can only
make a clock as huge as that one,

120
00:13:40,685 --> 00:13:43,655
I'm impressed that you
could make it to this planet.

121
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:45,615
N-Nobody asked you!

122
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:49,925
By the way, is that Kakarrot bastard here, too?

123
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:51,255
No, he's not!

124
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:55,465
We didn't know there
would be bad guys like you here!

125
00:13:57,305 --> 00:13:59,565
Is that so?

126
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:08,605
That's too bad, huh?

127
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:11,275
The three of us...

128
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:13,755
...are the last of the Saiyans.

129
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:22,095
When you get back to Earth,
tell him something for me.

130
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,635
Tell him I said that I will
come to Earth before long,

131
00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:45,615
and this time, I will blow
both you and the Earth away.

132
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:52,255
It's around time for you to be
missing your mother's milk, isn't it?

133
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:55,455
Hurry back to Earth, now.

134
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,275
That hurt!

135
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:14,405
But still...

136
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:19,915
...the Dragon Ball is safe!

137
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:40,595
Dammit! Isn't he back yet?!

138
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:45,635
Kuririn, I've taken down the house,
and returned it to its Capsule.

139
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:47,305
Isn't Gohan<i>-kun</i> back yet?

140
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:49,405
I-I don't see him yet.

141
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:53,615
I sure hope he wasn't discovered by Vegeta.

142
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,585
Vegeta has found out about this place.

143
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,255
We have to change locations, fast.

144
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:06,255
What is Gohan doing?! Hurry! Hurry!

145
00:16:17,975 --> 00:16:19,605
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

146
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,145
He's here!

147
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:24,945
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, I found this!

148
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:27,285
You did it! We've been waiting for this!

149
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:29,115
Gohan<i>-kun</i>, way to go!

150
00:16:32,655 --> 00:16:35,255
Gohan, I'll fill you in on the details later,

151
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,925
but we have to hurry
and get away from here,

152
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:38,925
or things are going to get dicey.

153
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:42,805
I know most of it already. Vegeta found me, too.

154
00:16:44,005 --> 00:16:46,765
But I managed to hide
the Dragon Ball somehow,

155
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,605
so I got away without him finding it.

156
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:51,935
Y-You were lucky, too, huh?

157
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:55,275
Kuririn, Gohan<i>-kun</i>, let's just get moving.

158
00:16:55,315 --> 00:16:56,975
–Right.
–Yeah.

159
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:19,865
This is the lake.

160
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:22,305
The Dragon Ball is submerged in here.

161
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,575
Once I pull it out...

162
00:17:30,685 --> 00:17:33,885
<i>...I will have all seven Dragon Balls together.</i>

163
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:35,985
<i>Take that, Freeza!</i>

164
00:17:36,025 --> 00:17:39,955
<i>As of right now, the universe belongs to me.</i>

165
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:52,265
<i>That's strange. It was</i>
<i>definitely submerged in this area.</i>

166
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:03,545
<i>It's gone! Impossible!</i>

167
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,385
<i>It was him!</i>

168
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,585
<i>The place where I ran into that kid...</i>

169
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:14,585
<i>...was exactly halfway between here</i>
<i>and the cave where those Earthlings were!</i>

170
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,595
<i>Why, that miserable brat!</i>

171
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:21,725
<i>But how did he search for the Dragon Ball?</i>

172
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,935
This is a clock!

173
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:30,605
<i>That was no clock! It was radar!</i>

174
00:18:30,645 --> 00:18:33,235
<i>Damn it!</i>

175
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,555
You Earthling punks!

176
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:47,895
Play me for a fool,
will you?! You'll pay for this!

177
00:18:51,265 --> 00:18:53,925
Damn it all!

178
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,205
Damn it all! Damn it all!

179
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,515
Where are you, you punk kids?!

180
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:19,395
Come on out, or you'll be sorry!

181
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:43,405
Dammit, they've disappeared, have they?!

182
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,885
Damn it all, I can't
sense their presence, either.

183
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:53,085
Those brats are able to control
their presence all the way down to zero.

184
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:58,225
I can't find them like this.

185
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:02,595
Those rotten Earthlings!
That was an insolent stunt to pull!

186
00:20:04,605 --> 00:20:11,235
But they are sure to come after the six
Dragon Balls that I have at some point.

187
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:13,945
And when they do...

188
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:33,925
It's okay.

189
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,625
He won't find us here.

190
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,265
Hold on a minute.

191
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:43,605
I can't even set up the house
in a place as tight as this, can I?

192
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,435
Please don't ask the impossible.

193
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:49,205
There aren't too many
caves like that last one, after all.

194
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:52,545
We just have to put up with it
until Father arrives, Bulma<i>-san.</i>

195
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:56,385
Huh? You mean, until Son<i>-kun</i>
gets here, a lady such as myself

196
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:59,285
is going to have to stay here, in a
place that doesn't even have a bathroom,

197
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,795
together with you guys?

198
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:05,555
Oh, you don't have to worry on that point.

199
00:21:05,595 --> 00:21:07,055
I'll be taking Gohan with me,

200
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:10,895
and we'll be going to
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>'s place again.

201
00:21:10,935 --> 00:21:13,865
Huh? How come?

202
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:14,905
What is this?!

203
00:21:14,945 --> 00:21:17,575
You mean you're going to be
leaving me here all by myself?!

204
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:21,575
Please bear with us. Once
Gohan meets Grand Elder<i>-sama,</i>

205
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:27,285
there's a chance that he will gain
enough strength to rival even Vegeta.

206
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:45,095
<i>Freeza's secret weapon, the Ginyu Special Corps,</i>

207
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:47,805
<i>had at last gone into action.</i>

208
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:59,745
<i>Goku was also headed for Planet Namek</i>

209
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:04,125
<i>while continuing to</i>
<i>train under 100-times gravity.</i>

210
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:09,625
<i>Vegeta was seething with anger.</i>

211
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:16,325
<i>And Kuririn and Gohan had</i>
<i>taken off to see the Grand Elder.</i>

212
00:22:17,675 --> 00:22:24,305
<i>A grand three-way battle intertwining</i>
<i>good and evil was about to begin.</i>

213
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:48,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

214
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

215
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

216
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

217
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

218
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,955
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

219
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,455
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

220
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

221
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:29,605
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

222
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

223
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

224
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

225
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

226
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

227
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,525
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

228
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,535
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

229
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:13,615
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

230
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:16,215
<i>Two more days to Planet Namek.</i>
<i>I guess I'll tough it out</i>

231
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,485
<i>in this 100-times</i>
<i>super-gravity a little while longer.</i>

232
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:21,825
<i>That's it! I'm at the end</i>
<i>of my rope with this planet!</i>

233
00:24:21,865 --> 00:24:25,155
<i>Aah! The Si Xing Qiu Ball is sinking!</i>

234
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,995
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

235
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:30,295
<i>"Watch Out, Bulma!!</i>
<i>Si Xing Qiu Falls into Freeza's Clutches."</i>

236
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:35,875
<i>Father, do I really have</i>
<i>enough power to rival Vegeta?</i>

237
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,275
"Next time"
"Watch Out, Bulma!!
<i>Si Xing Qiu</i> Falls into Freeza's Clutches"
