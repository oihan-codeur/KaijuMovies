00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:24,785
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:30,415
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:36,135
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,805 --> 00:00:41,765
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,555 --> 00:00:49,065
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:54,775
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:57,405
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,445 --> 00:01:00,285
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:03,115
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,155 --> 00:01:05,705
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:08,705
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:11,715
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:14,385
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:20,265
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

00:01:20,305 --> 00:01:23,095
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:25,725
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:28,725
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:31,105
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,145 --> 00:01:34,275
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:37,115
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,155 --> 00:01:39,945
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,985 --> 00:01:46,205
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:56,255
<i>Madoshi Babidi and Majin Boo, in</i>
<i>order to call out Trunks, Goten and Piccolo,</i>

24
00:01:56,295 --> 00:01:59,255
<i>head toward Metro West to destroy it.</i>

25
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:03,925
Son-<i>kun</i>, it really will be
bad if Metro West is destroyed!

26
00:02:03,965 --> 00:02:07,185
The Dragon Radar will also be lost!

27
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:13,145
All right, Trunks...

28
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:18,155
You return home as fast as you can,
get the Radar, and bring it back for us!

29
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:22,325
I will delay Majin Boo
and Babidi for a little while.

30
00:02:22,365 --> 00:02:26,285
W-Will you be all right?
Uncle, can you delay them?

31
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:28,745
Won't you get beaten right away?

32
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:31,745
Well, if it's just for a little while,
I can manage something.

33
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:36,965
Never mind me, hurry! Or else
they'll reach Metro West first, Trunks!

34
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:47,975
Yo!

35
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:52,185
Here I go!

36
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:06,705
And then, this is a Super Saiyan
that's gone even beyond Super Saiyan.

37
00:03:06,745 --> 00:03:09,245
And then... this...!

38
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:35,855
<i>In order to delay Majin Boo,</i>

39
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:39,735
<i>Goku went even farther than</i>
<i>going even beyond Super Saiyan,</i>

40
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:44,235
<i>to Super Saiyan 3, and then fought him!</i>

41
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:20,855
<i>"Bye Bye Babidi!! Majin Boo Rebels."</i>

42
00:04:33,665 --> 00:04:36,875
Boo! What's the matter! Boo!

43
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:51,095
They're over our city!

44
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,475
How dreadful! How dreadful!

45
00:04:57,185 --> 00:04:58,975
Way to go, Goku!

46
00:04:59,015 --> 00:05:00,565
Stay with it, Father!

47
00:05:03,645 --> 00:05:06,615
Th-This is Son?!

48
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:13,075
Super Saiyan 3 is far more
ferocious than we can imagine.

49
00:05:44,235 --> 00:05:49,985
Nice going! Nice going, Boo!
That's the way! Crush him!

50
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:51,365
Goku!

51
00:05:51,405 --> 00:05:52,995
Father!

52
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:57,535
It's okay! Son won't be defeated that easily!

53
00:05:57,575 --> 00:06:01,955
Nice going! Nice going, Boo! Nice going!

54
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:07,255
Nice going! Nice going, Boo!
Nice going! Nice going!

55
00:06:43,415 --> 00:06:48,085
It's not here! The Dragon Radar isn't anywhere!

56
00:06:50,385 --> 00:06:54,345
Hmm, now where was it...?

57
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:57,845
Shall we take a short
break and have some snacks?

58
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:00,395
We'll do a full-scale search afterward.

59
00:07:00,435 --> 00:07:02,395
There's no time for that!

60
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:05,935
If we don't hurry, Metro West will be destroyed!

61
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,025
If we lose the Dragon Radar,

62
00:07:08,065 --> 00:07:11,405
we won't be able to return all
the dead people back to normal!

63
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:14,445
My, that is a problem.

64
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:34,925
Go! Give it to him, Boo! Way to go! Way to go!

65
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:37,555
Ah, for crying out loud...!

66
00:07:37,595 --> 00:07:42,105
<i>Trunks' ki still hasn't moved!</i>
<i>What are you doing, Trunks?!</i>

67
00:07:42,145 --> 00:07:46,185
<i>It's no use. I'll have to buy a little more time...</i>

68
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,675
Hey, you! Where are you going?!

69
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:15,675
Are you trying to escape?! You coward!

70
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:30,355
Look! They're moving farther and farther away!

71
00:08:30,395 --> 00:08:32,355
Hooray! We're saved!

72
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:55,255
Nice going, Majin Boo!

73
00:08:56,885 --> 00:09:00,475
Father! Hang in there!

74
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:03,385
–Goku!
–Goku...

75
00:09:13,565 --> 00:09:15,525
That has to be it!

76
00:09:15,565 --> 00:09:16,905
What does?

77
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:21,905
Trunks doesn't know
where the Dragon Radar is.

78
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:25,705
Sorry! After all of us went
searching for the Dragon Balls earlier,

79
00:09:25,745 --> 00:09:28,545
I left it inside the airplane!

80
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:31,335
D-Does Trunks know about that?

81
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,875
He couldn't!

82
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:36,885
Then he must be figuring to
look in all the wrong places, right?

83
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:39,345
Come to mention it, he is taking a while...

84
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:42,515
We have to get in touch with Trunks right away!

85
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,935
Kuririn, a telephone! A telephone!

86
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:48,935
Easy for you to say, but
there aren't any phones here!

87
00:09:48,975 --> 00:09:52,275
Um, if it's a phone you need, I have one here.

88
00:09:52,315 --> 00:09:54,275
Videl!

89
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:56,695
Since I work as a Friend of Justice,

90
00:09:56,735 --> 00:10:01,285
I'm always carrying around a cellular
phone with me, in case of an emergency.

91
00:10:01,325 --> 00:10:05,575
All right! With this, we can contact Trunks!

92
00:10:05,615 --> 00:10:07,995
Oh, Videl, nicely done!

93
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:16,835
You go away!

94
00:10:19,295 --> 00:10:21,095
You got him! You got him!

95
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:39,315
Goku! That's quite enough!
Hurry and stop the fight!

96
00:10:39,355 --> 00:10:44,575
If you use any more energy than this,
the time you can be on Earth will be gone!

97
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:58,965
This guy is much stronger than I had thought!

98
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:08,845
Ah, Bulma? How are you?
Is everyone doing fine?

99
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:12,315
Fine! Fine! Can you put Trunks on?

100
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:17,315
Trunks? Just a moment. Trunks! Telephone!

101
00:11:17,355 --> 00:11:19,695
This isn't the time for that right now!

102
00:11:19,735 --> 00:11:21,865
He says this isn't the time for that right now.

103
00:11:21,905 --> 00:11:26,865
I don't have time for this either!
Hurry and put Trunks on!

104
00:11:26,905 --> 00:11:30,875
Inside the plane? Gotcha!
I'll go get it right away!

105
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:32,875
The plane! The plane!

106
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:40,295
Eh? Do we have any planes
in the house? Oh... Oh... Oh...

107
00:11:40,335 --> 00:11:42,755
Oh, the plane?

108
00:11:46,765 --> 00:11:48,595
The plane is right here.

109
00:11:56,935 --> 00:11:58,565
Okay, here goes again!

110
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:32,475
W-Wha-What the...?!

111
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:04,795
Boo! Majin Boo!

112
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:22,315
Majin Boo! Banzai!

113
00:13:32,995 --> 00:13:35,165
Don't tell me he's
doing a <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>!

114
00:13:55,885 --> 00:13:58,225
Dammit!

115
00:14:13,365 --> 00:14:16,665
A-All the way here, at this temple...!

116
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:29,135
<i>Incredible... It's an incredible fight!</i>

117
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:31,385
<i>We're this far apart,</i>

118
00:14:31,425 --> 00:14:34,345
<i>and yet I can tell what's</i>
<i>happening as if it were within my grasp!</i>

119
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:40,355
Gohan-<i>san</i>, it would be difficult
for Goku-<i>san</i> to win this after all.

120
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:44,355
Majin Boo is just that strong.

121
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:47,025
The best way to defeat Majin Boo

122
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:52,945
is still for you to master using
that legendary blade, the Z-Sword.

123
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:56,705
Understood.

124
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:09,675
It's quite difficult!

125
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,755
Can we rely on this?

126
00:15:11,795 --> 00:15:16,055
This is the legendary sword that
generations of Kaioshin were unable to wield!

127
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:45,915
B-Be more careful!

128
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:49,465
I was almost put in danger,
you know! You imbecile!

129
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:58,725
Even so, that just now destroyed
about one-tenth of the Earth, didn't it?

130
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:02,145
What a Friend to Justice you must be! Nyah!

131
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:08,275
Boo! You're better than
I expected! I'm surprised!

132
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:10,445
You don't have the face of
someone who knows much,

133
00:16:10,485 --> 00:16:11,815
but you've got a real gift for battle!

134
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:14,325
To think that you can read
through an opponent's techniques

135
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:16,325
and instead make them your own!

136
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:24,035
The airplane is inside this Capsule.

137
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,335
There you go, Trunks.

138
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:42,305
It's here! It's here!

139
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:46,855
My! That's terrific! Now,
won't you enjoy some snacks...?

140
00:16:46,895 --> 00:16:51,195
There isn't time for that! I'm in a hurry, so...!

141
00:16:51,235 --> 00:16:54,025
Oh, my! He came all this way.

142
00:16:54,065 --> 00:16:56,865
He could have eaten
some snacks before leaving...

143
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:07,955
<i>Trunks' ki has started moving!</i>

144
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:12,215
<i>He's safely found the Dragon Radar and</i>
<i>started moving away from Metro West!</i>

145
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:15,965
<i>All right! This is where my role ends!</i>

146
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,555
Hey, why'd you go back to normal?

147
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:31,065
It's fun fighting you! Let's do some more!

148
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:36,155
That's quite an honor.
But I ain't got any more time.

149
00:17:36,195 --> 00:17:41,735
I can't play with just you forever.
Sorry, but I have to get back.

150
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:48,085
Idiot! Do you think you can escape now?!

151
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:52,335
Majin Boo! Make an
example of him! Kill this guy!

152
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:57,345
After you kill him,

153
00:17:57,385 --> 00:18:01,215
we'll go immediately to Metro West
and destroy everything there!

154
00:18:01,255 --> 00:18:03,175
We'll kill everyone!

155
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:08,935
By doing so, those three that
opposed us are sure to come forward!

156
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:12,735
Listen up, Babidi!

157
00:18:12,775 --> 00:18:17,615
The three who you're looking
for–Piccolo, Trunks, and Goten–

158
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:22,325
are guaranteed to appear
in three–no, two days!

159
00:18:24,285 --> 00:18:27,245
So until then, don't do anything, just wait!

160
00:18:27,285 --> 00:18:30,085
Stop killing people for no reason!

161
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:34,125
Two days. Just two days! That's okay, ain't it?

162
00:18:35,295 --> 00:18:38,135
Are those guys strong?

163
00:18:38,175 --> 00:18:40,345
Of course they are!

164
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:47,095
Do you really think I will
lend an ear to those words?

165
00:18:47,135 --> 00:18:50,975
We're going to kill even more now, you know!

166
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,275
Gee, that's too bad.

167
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:57,985
It sounds like it would be a
rare, fun battle for Majin Boo.

168
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,115
Hey, Babidi!

169
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:02,155
I'm going to ask Great King Yama
to see to it that once you get to Hell,

170
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:05,615
you get squeezed plenty hard!

171
00:19:05,655 --> 00:19:07,615
Up yours!

172
00:19:07,655 --> 00:19:10,115
So then, see you later!

173
00:19:18,215 --> 00:19:20,295
H-He vanished!

174
00:19:23,465 --> 00:19:25,015
W-What was that all about?

175
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,635
That guy, why the hell did he come here?

176
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,515
Hey, Majin Boo! You let
him get away, didn't you?!

177
00:19:31,555 --> 00:19:36,225
It's your fault for
dilly-dallying around! You dimwit!

178
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:40,815
He's got to still be around here somewhere!

179
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:44,025
Hurry and find him! Hurry!

180
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:52,375
Hey! Didn't you hear me?!
You do it! Get going now! Tubby!

181
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:05,175
Babidi-<i>sama</i>?

182
00:20:05,215 --> 00:20:07,555
W-What is it?

183
00:20:07,595 --> 00:20:10,555
I had a good idea.

184
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:15,185
What?! A good idea? An idiot like you?

185
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:20,185
I doubt it's anything too great,
but go ahead and tell me!

186
00:20:22,065 --> 00:20:24,575
You know what, Babidi-<i>sama</i>?

187
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:30,865
What?! Hurry it up! Tell me
quick, and then go after that guy!

188
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:43,215
You can't talk, right?

189
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:48,305
That means you can't say
the spell to seal me up again!

190
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,945
Father!

191
00:21:01,985 --> 00:21:04,115
Son!

192
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:06,445
You were incredible, Father!

193
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:10,575
Are you okay, Son?

194
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:11,955
Yeah!

195
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:15,375
Trunks is apparently
heading back here and all.

196
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:18,125
For the moment, we're out of danger, huh?

197
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:19,915
For the moment.

198
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:23,215
Even if Metro West is destroyed,
as long as we have the Dragon Radar,

199
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:25,715
we can turn it back to the way it was.

200
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:28,175
The dead people, too.

201
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:44,275
I've taken a lot from you.

202
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:46,775
Now I don't have any more to do with you.

203
00:21:46,815 --> 00:21:49,325
I won't stand you any more!

204
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:03,335
Die! You fool!

205
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:21,435
<i>At last, Majin Boo has</i>
<i>turned against Madoshi Babidi!</i>

206
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,025
<i>What will Boo do?</i>

207
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:29,405
<i>Will he continue his destruction?</i>
<i>Is there no one now who can stop Boo?!</i>

208
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:38,865
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

209
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:45,455
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

210
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:56,015
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

211
00:22:56,055 --> 00:23:02,145
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

212
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:09,155
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

213
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:14,535
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

214
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:18,365
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

215
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:27,465
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

216
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,005
<i>Even now?</i>

217
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:36,635
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

218
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:42,015
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

219
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:48,525
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

220
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:58,535
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

221
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:15,805
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

222
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,425
<i>Goten, Trunks, not to mention Piccolo,</i>

223
00:24:18,465 --> 00:24:20,805
<i>I'm going to show you the Fusion Pose now,</i>

224
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:22,515
<i>so watch and learn closely, okay?</i>

225
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:27,355
<i>What do we do? That looks awful!</i>
<i>I don't want to have to do that!</i>

226
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,645
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

227
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:33,615
<i>"Absurdly Awful-Looking!?</i>
<i>The Special Training Transformation Pose."</i>

228
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:37,365
<i>Once those two undergo Fusion,</i>
<i>I wonder what they'll look like.</i>

229
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:39,655
"Next time"
"Absurdly Awful-Looking!?
The Special Training Transformation Pose"
