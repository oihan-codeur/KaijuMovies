3
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,750
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:43,100
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6

<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,990
I'm not going to put up with you anymore.

17
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,580
So you've finally shown
your true form, have you?

18
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,960
Now things are beginning to get interesting.

19
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,540
Give these to everyone.

20
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,500
Right.

21
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,880
<i>Gohan showed his overwhelming strength</i>

22
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,140
<i>by defeating the Cell Juniors in an instant.</i>

23
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,600
<i>Is this the limit-transcending power</i>

26
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:35,660
Thank goodness, he's still breathing.

27
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,470
Trunks...?

28
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,810
How's Gohan?

29
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,270
He's incredible.

30
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,440
I've never seen Gohan-<i>san</i> like this.

31
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,500
Th-That's Gohan?

32
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,460
I-Incredible! What happened to him?

33
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,920
That could be what Goku was talking about.

34
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,090
S-So it would seem...

35
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:33,090
Okay, everyone, hurry and
move away from here, please.

36
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,390
I'm going to go deliver these
<i>senzu</i> to Goku-<i>san</i> and Piccolo-<i>san.</i>

37
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,390
Quickly!

38
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,550
Come.

39
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,180
Too slow!

40
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,800
Toy with me, will you?!

41
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,830
C-Cell's attacks aren't connecting...!

42
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,460
So that's it, huh?

43
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,090
Son, I've figured out the
reason why you fought first.

44
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:43,100
You wanted to show Gohan
how Cell fights. Am I wrong?

45
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,020
Is that true?

46
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,740
It's Cell!

47
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,910
P-People of the world!

48
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,660
My camera may be broken,

49
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,460
but is my voice still getting through?

50
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,840
Right now, the death battle
between Cell and the <i>bento</i> salesboy

51
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,510
is unfolding right before my eyes!

52
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,930
Y-You're such a pro.

53
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,100
H-However, I will not move!

54
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,100
What a courageous announcer I must be!

55
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,020
U-Um, your mike...

56
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:43,370
"One moment please..."

57
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,500
What in the world is going on?

58
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,710
Isn't it obvious?

59
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,210
Is there anyone besides
Satan who can defeat Cell?!

60
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,840
Which must mean that Satan has lost...!

61
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
Is this the end of the Earth?

62
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,840
Is this the end? It surely is...

63
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,930
I-It can't be...!

64
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,100
"One moment please..."

65
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,330
Hey, Piroshiki! What are you doing?!

66
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,580
You'll be caught in the crossfire there!

67
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,420
I-I can't move!

68
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,090
I-Is he still there?! That idiot!

69
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,390
Doesn't he understand that
unless he's a pro at fighting,

70
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,140
like I am, that he can't stay here?!

71
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,460
Take this!!

72
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,000
W-When did you find time for them...?

73
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,130
I-Impossible...!

74
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,230
That's it, Gohan.

75
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,480
Thanks to you,

76
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,070
Gohan is completely reading
Cell's movements ahead of time.

77
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,320
That's got nothing to do with it.

78
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,070
Gohan has surpassed Cell in every way.

79
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,490
What?

80
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,580
G-Gohan's not bad, huh?

81
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,040
With Gohan like this,
he might be able to beat Cell.

82
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,880
<i>Why, you...!</i>

83
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,930
<i>To think that there's another bastard out</i>
<i>there besides Kakarrot that has surpassed me...!</i>

84
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,260
Dad...

85
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,970
Here's a <i>senzu.</i>

86
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,600
Sheesh, do I have to rely on one of these again?!

87
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,440
Damn...!

88
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,170
I-Impossible! How could
not even one punch land?!

89
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,930
If only I could hit him...!

90
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,210
W-Why, you...!

91
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,680
Don't get too full of yourself, kid.

92
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,060
You don't seriously think
that you can defeat me, do you?

93
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,060
I'll defeat you, all right.

94
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,900
That's pretty big talk, huh?

95
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,110
Well then, why don't I show you the true,

96
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,530
terrifying power of Cell?

97
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,530
What?!

98
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:40,910
Impossible!

99
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,910
You mean Cell hasn't been
taking this serious up to now?!

100
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,080
Th-That can't be...!

101
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,250
I-Is he saying he's going to
raise his power even higher?!

102
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:55,420
He's bluffing... He has to be bluffing...!

103
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,750
W-W-What kind of guy is this?!

104
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:30,290
It's a trick! It must be a trick!

105
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,810
He's swelling his <i>ki</i> up, augmenting it...

106
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,150
He wasn't... bluffing...!

107
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,490
That miserable freak!

108
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,160
Gohan...!

109
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,950
This is impossible...!

110
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,250
I-Is there no bottom to
the depths of his power?!

111
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,540
Th-The Earth is trembling!

112
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,890
W-What's this?

113
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,940
I-It's an earthquake!

114
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,690
I-It's finally here!

115
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,860
The end of the world!
The Earth–the Earth is lost!

116
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,240
"One moment please..."

117
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:05,720
"One moment please..."

118
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,100
So Cell's finally going
to fight at full power, huh?

119
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,690
What a <i>ki</i>!

120
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,900
It's like the whole universe is shaking!

121
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,940
I-Is this possible?

122
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,400
That's an outrageous amount of <i>ki</i>, isn't it?

123
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,290
G-Gohan-<i>san...</i>

124
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,660
How's that? This is me, when I mean business!

125
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,210
What of it?

126
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:21,230
H-He's fast!

127
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,900
His power isn't the only thing he raised!

128
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,070
His speed is also greater!

129
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,300
I-Impossible...!

130
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:48,940
W-Why, after only two punches...

131
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,490
...have I taken this much damage...?

132
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,500
A-Awesome... what power...!

133
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:07,920
Looks like there's still a
difference between their two forces!

134
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,510
H-He can win... Gohan-<i>san</i> can win!

135
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,060
<i>After just two blows, the</i>
