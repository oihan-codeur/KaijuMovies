There won't be any

Be sure to enjoy yourselves

Are you okay?

22
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,335
You can rest easy now.

23
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,435
Aw, did he leave?

24
00:03:31,475 --> 00:03:37,505
Never mind that guy, what kinda idiot
are you? How come ya didn't finish him off?

25
00:03:40,485 --> 00:03:44,455
Sorry about that, Kuririn...

26
00:03:44,495 --> 00:03:48,785
Don't worry about it. I did feel
bad for everyone who died, though.

27
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:52,525
But even so, we might still be
able to bring them back to life.

28
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,065
H-He couldn't be!

29
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,285
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

30
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:24,855
Ch-Chichi?

00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,885
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

35
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:55,185
Gohan<i>-chan</i>! Gohan<i>-chan</i>!
Are you okay?! Wake up! Ma is here!

36
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:58,995
Gohan<i>-chan...</i> What an
awful thing to go through...

37
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:01,395
G-Gohan is fine.

38
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:09,265
Goku is in far worse shape than him.
See? You see? Over here. See?

39
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:13,275
You poor thing! Bein' forced
to go through somethin' like this!

40
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:18,545
You're never goin' to leave your
Ma's side again! You poor thing!

41
00:05:20,455 --> 00:05:24,855
<i>That's just not right. Goku had it hard, too.</i>

42
00:05:24,895 --> 00:05:27,425
S-Son<i>-kun...</i>

43
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:28,855
Goku...

44
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,485
Son<i>-kun...</i>

45
00:05:32,295 --> 00:05:34,265
Are you okay, Son<i>-kun</i>?

46
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:36,865
T-This is awful.

47
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:41,435
S-Sorry... I let the Saiyan get away...

48
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:45,275
Not at all. Just driving
him away was quite a feat.

49
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:47,875
Ah, Karin<i>-sama...</i>

50
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:51,615
Saying he was strong doesn't begin to cover it.

51
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:59,155
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>, Yamucha was... Except for
the four of us, everyone else was done in...

52
00:05:59,195 --> 00:06:02,255
Uh-huh, we saw it on TV.

53
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,255
But Piccolo died, which
means that so has Kami<i>-sama...</i>

54
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:09,465
He's right. And that means the Dragon Balls...

55
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:15,865
I know what that means!

56
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:22,445
Y-You knew, didn't you?

57
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:25,445
Y-Yeah.

58
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:29,855
If only Piccolo had been one of the survivors...

59
00:06:29,895 --> 00:06:31,885
Well 'scuse me for livin'.

60
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:40,135
That's right! All you did was
run away! You didn't fight one bit!

61
00:06:42,465 --> 00:06:44,435
What did you say?!

62
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:51,175
A good-for-nothing like you should
have died right off, instead of Piccolo!

63
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:53,515
You idiot!

64
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:04,455
If I hadn'a been there,
these guys wouldn'a survived!

65
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:08,285
This is pissin' me off! I'm sick of bein' good!

66
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:10,055
All right, all right.

67
00:07:10,095 --> 00:07:13,465
More importantly, we should
hurry and get the injured to a hospital.

68
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,495
There aren't any more Senzu.

69
00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:21,335
Easy, easy! Easy now...

70
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:57,205
Everyone's bodies are around here, right?

71
00:07:57,245 --> 00:08:00,305
Um... a little more that way.

72
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:15,425
Bulma<i>-san</i>, don't cry. There's only
a very slim chance that this is possible,

73
00:08:15,465 --> 00:08:19,425
and maybe it's even a little crazy,

74
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,425
so listen to me, but don't get your hopes up.

75
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:28,895
I-It's possible that we can bring everyone
who was killed by the Saiyans back to life.

76
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:32,435
What do you mean?

77
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:33,875
Really?

78
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:36,875
This is going to sound
like grasping at clouds...

79
00:08:36,915 --> 00:08:42,885
K-Kuririn... you said
something about that to me, too...

80
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:46,455
What do you mean? Tell us...

81
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:49,155
A-As it happens...

82
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:52,055
Just a minute. I'll tell you later.

83
00:08:52,095 --> 00:08:56,865
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>, land here. We
have to load up everyone else's bodies.

84
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:22,855
Chaozu's body is the
only one left. Let's see now...

85
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,495
There isn't one.

86
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:27,505
He blew himself to pieces.

87
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:36,265
I really would like to
bring them all back to life.

88
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:40,845
As it stands, their sacrifice was all too great.

89
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:44,645
Karin<i>-sama</i>, all I feel is anger...

90
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,885
at my own helplessness...

91
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:56,795
Now then...

92
00:09:56,835 --> 00:09:59,495
That's okay. I'll pilot us.

93
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:03,795
I've calmed down a little.

94
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,895
O-Okay...

95
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:51,975
Gohan<i>-chan</i>! Are you wakin' up?

96
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:57,845
Relax! It's Ma! It's your Ma!

97
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:00,145
M-Mother?

98
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:07,125
You poor thing! It must have
been so scary! But you're okay now!

99
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:10,525
Yeah, you did great! You're really something!

100
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:11,955
We got through it!

101
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:14,995
H-How? Where is the Saiyan?

102
00:12:16,165 --> 00:12:21,265
He got away... He got away from us.

103
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:26,105
B-But still, we all hurt
him something terrible, right?

104
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:28,545
He might never come back.

105
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:33,115
Where's Father?!

106
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:36,115
I'm in the back, Gohan...

107
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,995
Thanks to you guys,
I managed to survive somehow...

108
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,665
Hey, this is fine an' all,

109
00:12:48,705 --> 00:12:51,535
but yer Goku's wife, right?

110
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:56,665
Stop worryin' about just the kid,
and look after yer husband, would ya?

111
00:12:56,705 --> 00:12:59,735
How rude! Nothin' doin'.

112
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,705
It's because of Goku<i>-sa</i> that
Gohan<i>-chan</i> went through all that nastiness!

113
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:04,715
He didn't have to drag my boy into that!

114
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:07,315
That's not true, Mother! Father was–

115
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:12,955
I'm far more worried about your future,
Gohan, than I am about the Earth!

116
00:13:15,365 --> 00:13:18,195
Goku, can I slug her?

117
00:13:22,205 --> 00:13:23,735
Kuririn...

118
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:26,595
Would you tell us about
what you were saying earlier?

119
00:13:26,635 --> 00:13:28,435
O-Oh, right.

120
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:35,175
The Saiyans probably learned about
there being Dragon Balls here on Earth,

121
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:40,745
via Goku's brother's radio, or whatever.
The part about having wishes granted, too.

122
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:45,715
So, as long as they were here, they
were trying to get the Dragon Balls, too.

123
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:46,715
Really?

124
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:47,525
Yeah.

125
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:52,425
But when they saw Piccolo's face,
they called him something weird.

126
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,335
A "Namekian."

127
00:13:57,275 --> 00:14:03,135
Piccolo–and Kami<i>-sama,</i>
too–appear to have been aliens.

128
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,305
That's no wonder, what with his face.

129
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,145
The important part is what they said next.

130
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:13,315
Nappa! Kill them!

131
00:14:13,355 --> 00:14:15,745
But what about the Dragon Balls?

132
00:14:15,785 --> 00:14:19,115
I don't care! I have an idea.

133
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:22,755
If we go to Planet Namek,
the home world of that Namekian,

134
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,425
I'm sure that there will be Dragon
Balls that are even more powerful.

135
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:30,295
Is that all they said? That's nonsense.

136
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,935
I heard him, too.

137
00:14:31,975 --> 00:14:36,805
He said that Namekians have
the power to create mysterious balls.

138
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:43,145
If–and that's a really big if–we were
able to go to this Planet Namek place,

139
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:45,775
we might be able to obtain their Dragon Balls.

140
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:47,315
I-I get it.

141
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:51,655
If you did that, you would be able
to bring those who had died back to life.

142
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:53,455
Piccolo<i>-san</i> could come back to life!

143
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:56,025
G-Gohan<i>-chan</i>, how can you say that?!

144
00:14:56,065 --> 00:14:59,755
That's right! If Piccolo came
back to life, so would Kami<i>-sama</i>!

145
00:14:59,795 --> 00:15:03,165
And that means we could
restore the Dragon Balls here, too!

146
00:15:04,805 --> 00:15:07,335
–Banzai! Banzai!
–T-That's incredible!

147
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,135
Then there's a chance...
There really is a chance!

148
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,545
Isn't there? Isn't there? Isn't there?

149
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:17,515
You amateurs make it
sound so nice and simple.

150
00:15:18,555 --> 00:15:23,145
There's no way we could pull off that
kind of dream. I hate to burst your bubble.

151
00:15:23,185 --> 00:15:26,315
N-Not even you can do it, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

152
00:15:26,355 --> 00:15:27,855
In the first place, Kuririn,

153
00:15:27,895 --> 00:15:31,695
how are we supposed to know where
this whatever-it's-called planet even is?

154
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:36,165
L-Let me take care of that...

155
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:39,165
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, you're listening, right?

156
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:44,735
Do you know where this Planet Namek is?

157
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:46,975
Planet Namek? Of course I know.

158
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,845
Whatever else you may say,
I <i>am</i> a Kaio, after all.

159
00:15:50,885 --> 00:15:57,215
T-This is amazing. We can hear him, too.
This gentleman is Kaio<i>-sama</i>, is he?

160
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:02,825
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, it looks like everyone
else can hear you, too, so tell us.

161
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:08,725
Before I do, allow me to say
one thing. You all did really well.

162
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:12,735
Once Son Goku had been done in,
I honestly thought it was hopeless.

163
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:14,535
That was really something.

164
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:21,105
Still, I got a pretty big shock.
Not even <i>Kaio-ken</i> worked against him...

165
00:16:21,145 --> 00:16:26,845
Yeah, even I greatly miscalculated
that Saiyan Vegeta's strength.

166
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,945
Who knew he'd be that strong?

167
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:33,285
M-Maybe I really was
wrong to let him get away...

168
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,085
Maybe so.

169
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:39,525
H-Hey, what does he mean?
Don't tell me Goku intentionally...

170
00:16:39,565 --> 00:16:42,295
I-I'll tell you all the details later.

171
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,735
Now then, Planet Namek's location...

172
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:50,235
To put it in the terms
you'd use on Earth... let's see...

173
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:56,245
Bearing SW66 by...
no, no, let's see here...

174
00:16:56,285 --> 00:17:03,545
Bearing SU83 by... 9045XY, is it?

175
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:07,325
9045XY, did you say?!

176
00:17:07,365 --> 00:17:10,555
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>, do you know where that is?

177
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:14,565
H-Hey, Turtle<i>-chan</i>, take
over piloting. I've got to calculate this.

178
00:17:14,605 --> 00:17:16,925
T-Turtle<i>-chan</i>?

179
00:17:16,965 --> 00:17:19,835
I've got a bad feeling about this...

180
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:25,305
Planet Namek used to be a
very beautiful planet, as I recall,

181
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,745
but some time ago, they went through
a terrible bout of abnormal weather.

182
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:33,545
I thought that all of the
Namekians died out at that time.

183
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,755
The planet itself is currently in
the process of returning to normal,

184
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:42,755
but as for whether
or not anyone survived...

185
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,155
O-Oh, no...

186
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:49,095
This is hopeless. Ain't no way
there're still Dragon Balls there.

187
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,265
H-Hey, you!

188
00:17:50,305 --> 00:17:55,265
Don't panic. Once I check
up on Planet Namek, I'll know.

189
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:59,805
Now, where was it? Let's see...

190
00:18:03,885 --> 00:18:05,515
This way, huh?

191
00:18:05,555 --> 00:18:06,445
So that's it!

192
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:13,115
That's the reason why Kami– or rather,
the Namekian who became Kami–fled to Earth.

193
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:17,955
Kami himself may have forgotten
that because he lost his memory,

194
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:22,525
or maybe he was just too young a child.
Either way, it's a sad past.

195
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:28,165
Yeah, but Dragon Balls
can grant any wish, right?

196
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:29,965
If they're the guys
that could make them things,

197
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:34,175
they coulda just wished to have
the abnormal weather stopped, right?

198
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:36,345
That probably wouldn't have worked.

199
00:18:36,385 --> 00:18:38,545
Shen Long said that he couldn't grant a wish

200
00:18:38,585 --> 00:18:44,155
that exceeded the power
of the Dragon Balls' creator.

201
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:47,725
That means he couldn't rein in
that incredible amount of power.

202
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:52,055
That's why Shen Long couldn't
do anything against the Saiyans.

203
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:57,195
What're ya talkin' about? I guess
the Dragon Balls ain't so great after all.

204
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:01,935
You're a sassy fellow!

205
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,835
What's this? There are some! There are some!

206
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,175
There are some Namekians!
There's just under a hundred of them,

207
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:09,975
but they survived, and are thriving again!

208
00:19:11,785 --> 00:19:14,585
T-There're a hundred guys like that?!

209
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:26,525
Not to worry. Namekians are a
very mild-mannered race by nature.

210
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:30,335
Like that guy who was Kami on your Earth.

211
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:35,105
Piccolo Daimao was
probably someone who was born

212
00:19:35,145 --> 00:19:42,135
of the evil influence of earthlings
that he encountered before becoming Kami.

213
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:51,885
That explains it.

214
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:55,825
There are some nasty types
out there in the world, after all.

215
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:56,855
Look who's talking.

216
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,095
But now there's a possibility that Kami,

217
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:03,265
not to mention Yamucha and
Tenshinhan, can come back to life!

218
00:20:03,305 --> 00:20:06,235
You're naïve! You're absolutely naïve!

219
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:12,075
Indeed, I figured out where Planet Namek is.
But how are you planning to go there?

220
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:16,075
H-How? Well, in a spaceship, of course.

221
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:19,645
That's where you're being
completely naïve, I tell you!

222
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,315
If you used a spaceship

223
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:24,115
with the world's most powerful engine,
an experimental model my dad made,

224
00:20:24,155 --> 00:20:27,855
I calculated how much time it
would take you to reach Planet Namek.

225
00:20:29,295 --> 00:20:33,255
Exactly how long do you think it would take?

226
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:36,865
I came up with a positively enormous figure.

227
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:41,535
Look here. It would take
4,339 years and three months.

228
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,135
You'd have to live to a ripe old age, huh?

229
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:48,045
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what should we do?

230
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:54,245
Y-Y-You're asking me?

231
00:20:57,025 --> 00:21:00,215
If that's the problem,
I think we'll be all right.

232
00:21:00,255 --> 00:21:05,025
I'm thinking of using the spaceship
that that Saiyan came here in.

233
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:11,235
The Saiyan's? But the Saiyan took
that one and ran away, didn't he?

234
00:21:11,275 --> 00:21:13,235
We saw the spaceship
belonging to that Vegeta guy,

235
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:16,665
but it was very small, and anyhow
you look at it, it had to be a one-seater.

236
00:21:16,705 --> 00:21:19,975
Which means that the spaceship
belonging to that other one who died

237
00:21:20,015 --> 00:21:21,505
has to be out there somewhere.

238
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:27,075
T-That's right! And there's the one
that my brother Raditz came in, too!

239
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:31,215
Come to think of it, that
one got destroyed by Gohan...

240
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,055
But anyhow, there's still one of them, right?

241
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:37,655
If I can find that one and analyze it,
I just might come up with something.

242
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,325
It's probably in Metro East.

243
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,525
That's the first place the Saiyans destroyed.

244
00:21:43,565 --> 00:21:45,565
We'll have to go look for it later.

245
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,065
I was thinking that, and
picked up a nice little something.

246
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:56,075
This. I'm sure that Vegeta guy
beeped this thing to call his spaceship.

247
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,145
It has to be a remote control!

248
00:22:03,385 --> 00:22:06,225
We can do this! We can definitely do this!

249
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:12,595
Yay! Yay! Hope is in sight!

250
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:17,465
Planet Namek or bust!

251
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:24,135
<i>A destination planet had been settled on.</i>

252
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:30,135
<i>However, there were still some</i>
<i>difficult problems to solve beforehand.</i>

253
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:48,625

<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

254
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

255
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

256
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

257
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,855
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

258
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:15,955

261
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:29,605
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

262
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,705
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

263
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

264
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

265
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

266
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

267
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

268
00:23:55,265 --> 00:24:00,535
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

269
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:13,675
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

270
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:16,645
<i>Aw, man, they said it would be</i>
<i>four months until my injuries heal.</i>

271
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:21,085
<i>Hey, in one more month, some</i>
<i>new senzu beans will be ready.</i>

272
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,525
<i>More importantly, Mister Popo has taken Bulma</i>

273
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:25,725
<i>and gone out looking for a spaceship.</i>

274
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:27,595

<i>"Mysterious Yunzabit!</i>

276

<i>This is a secret, but</i>
