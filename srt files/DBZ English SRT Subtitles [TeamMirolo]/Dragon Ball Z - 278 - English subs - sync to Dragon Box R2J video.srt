00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,830
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,410
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,170
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,800
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,060
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,820
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,400
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,320
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,160
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,700
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,700
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,710
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:20,260
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,140
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,720
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,720
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,100
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,310
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,940
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:46,240
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,100
<i>Having slipped inside Boo's body,</i>

24
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,720
<i>Goku and Vegeta have escaped</i>
<i>with Gohan, Piccolo, and the others.</i>

25
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:31,080
<i>However, Majin Boo then transformed into a</i>
<i>Boo with no self-control, the essence of evil!</i>

26
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,210
<i>It's hopeless! I can't do Instantaneous</i>
<i>Movement in such a brief amount of time!</i>

27
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,640
<i>It was at that time when Kaioshin</i>

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,060
<i>instantaneously moved from the Kaioshin</i>
<i>Realm and saved Goku and the others.</i>

29
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,320
<i>However, the Earth was in the end</i>
<i>destroyed, as were Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks.</i>

30
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,250
<i>"Boo's Assault!!</i>
<i>A Conclusion in the Kaioshin Realm."</i>

31
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,770
Th-The Earth...!

32
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,770
It's been wiped out.

33
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,780
It's been blown to bits.

34
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,570
Then, what about Piccolo,
and Gohan and the others?

35
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:52,410
Unfortunately, they went
together with the Earth.

36
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,330
Th-The Earth has been wiped out?

37
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,040
What sort of nonsense are you talking about?

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,800
It's right here, isn't it? Right here!

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,630
You're just a geezer who says funny things.

40
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,800
H-How can you say that?! Be quiet!

41
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,770
Those gentlemen are Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>! Probably.

42
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,770
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>? What's that?

43
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,650
In short... Now listen, above
Kami-<i>sama</i>, there are Kaio-<i>sama,</i>

44
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,200
and above that, there
is the Grand Kaio-<i>sama.</i>

45
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,160
Above even that, at the very top
stand those two, the Kaioshin-<i>sama.</i>

46
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,830
And this is not Earth, but probably
the holy land of the Kaioshin Realm!

47
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,720
You're taking this joke too far!

48
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:54,390
If those geezers are so awesome, then
why don't they do something about Boo?

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,680
W-Well, they...

50
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,770
He sure gets you where it hurts, huh?

51
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,230
And I thought it was suspicious

52
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,150
that someone like you would
be Kami-<i>sama</i> in the first place.

53
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,360
So that's it!

54
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,780
I finally figured it out!

55
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,780
It's a dream!

56
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,750
This is a dream!

57
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,210
That's it! A dream!

58
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:25,750
Ah, I get it! Here I thought
that things were weird!

59
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:29,760
After all, there's no way that anyone
stronger than I, the World Champion,

60
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,050
could exist in this world, is there?

61
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,970
There really is no Majin Boo,

62
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,930
and these guys are just
strange characters in my dream!

63
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,190
That would be consistent!

64
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,230
I thought that things starting
with the Tenkaichi Tournament

65
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,360
were weird right from the beginning!

66
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,740
U-Um...

67
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,530
That's right! If this is a dream,
I think I'll try to fly through the air, too!

68
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,490
U-Um...!

69
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,050
Listen well, Majin Boo!

70
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,010
This may be a dream, but how
dare you kill my cute daughter Videl,

71
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,800
and blow the Earth away!

72
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,060
I, Mister Satan, will fly
into space, and put you down!

73
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm going to fly!

74
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,370
Th-That hurt!!

75
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:44,750
It hurt! It's a dream,
yet it still hurt! It hurt!

76
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:48,340
He's quite an amusing fellow, huh?

77
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
Kakarrot!

78
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:55,760
You let Piccolo and Gohan and the others,
who we worked so hard to rescue,

79
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,090
die instead of that big idiot!

80
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:01,600
There's no bringing them back!

81
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,390
Our last hope, the Dragon Balls,
were wiped out along with Earth, after all!

82
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,730
Look at this!

83
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,860
After being blown to pieces,
Majin Boo is returning to normal!

84
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,340
Dammit!

85
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,800
It's him, all right!

86
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:40,890
If any fragment of Majin Boo remains,
then no matter where he is, he will recover.

87
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,860
Where did he go?!

88
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,780
It looks like Boo instantaneously
moved to another planet.

89
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,200
This is terrible!

90
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,950
He immediately grasped onto Kibit's
instantaneous movement technique.

91
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:47,790
<i>What the hell is he...?</i>

92
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,670
He's searching for you guys.

93
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,500
He's seeking out any strong <i>ki</i>
he can find in the vastness of space.

94
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,180
And because of us, he deliberately
continues that meaningless destruction?

95
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,600
That's the kind of guy Boo is.

96
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,770
Again, many lives throughout
the entire universe are being lost.

97
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,280
And even if we are able to
defeat Boo, we can't return Earth,

98
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,360
or those other planets,
back the way they were.

99
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,370
Th-That's it!

100
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,790
There still are some Dragon Balls!

101
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,130
There are, aren't there? If we
go to my home planet of Namek,

102
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,760
I'm sure the new Elder-<i>sama</i> will
still have the Dragon Balls made!

103
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,350
They can be returned!
The Earth, and the other planets!

104
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,100
And all those many people
who were killed by Boo, too!

105
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,150
–Th-That's it!
–No, hold on!

106
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:59,690
Dende, Planet Namek is pretty far away, huh?

107
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,780
The <i>ki</i> from Planet Namek ain't all that large,

108
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,120
so it would be kind of impossible to get
there with my Instantaneous Movement.

109
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,700
There are no spaceships anymore, either...

110
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,080
I-I see...

111
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,670
<i>–Damn!</i>
–Uh...

112
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:22,670
I don't know the slightest about
what these Dragon Ball things are,

113
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,470
but I can instantaneously
move from this Kaioshin Realm

114
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,180
to all the planets in the lower realm!

115
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,100
You just saw it a moment ago, right?
This is Kibit's forte technique.

116
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,690
Great! That does it!

117
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,690
In that case, once we defeat
Boo, things will work out fine!

118
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,690
H-Hold on!

119
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,110
You must not use those Dragon Balls!

120
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,620
They invite confusion into the natural order!

121
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,670
They are only permitted to the
somber Namekians, and possess,

122
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,590
as it were, capability that runs afoul!

123
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,470
Long ago, they were advised to
only use them on Planet Namek!

124
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:09,930
In fact, the old Namekians would absolutely
not use them on matters of other planets!

125
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:16,690
Don't be so rigid, old timer!

126
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,770
You know what? If things go well,

127
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,360
I'll take some steamy,
dirty photos of a woman I know,

128
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,440
and give you the unedited prints!

129
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,580
D-Dirty photos?

130
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,120
There, see? You want them, right?

131
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,500
She's not all that young,
but she still has her bounce!

132
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,670
But this woman has been killed, right?

133
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,300
That's why we should bring her back to
life with the Dragon Balls, shouldn't we?

134
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,220
Hey, Kakarrot!

135
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,680
Yes?

136
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,100
This woman–don't tell me you're
talking about Bulma, are you?

137
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,100
S-So it is, huh?!

138
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,020
Why, you! Use other people's
wives as you like, will you?!

139
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,360
You can give him those of your
own wife–photos of Chichi's <i>chi-chis</i>!

140
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,360
N-No... she ain't got any more
bounce left, and I'd get killed!

141
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,580
J-Just a moment!

142
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,250
Boo is about to move again! He is
seeking out Goku-<i>san</i> and Vegeta-<i>san</i>'s <i>ki</i>!

143
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,980
Bravo!

144
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,400
Yamucha! Let's go!

145
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Come on, Kuririn!

146
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,010
It's...!

147
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,640
M-Majin Boo!

148
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,380
W-Who is he?

149
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,460
Has he come to train?

150
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,880
What's the matter, Kaio of the North?

151
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,470
It's Majin Boo!

152
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,100
So, he's finally come here, huh?

153
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,980
Boo has at length gotten
to the Grand Kaio's World.

154
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,730
If he's coming, let him come!

155
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,400
Hey, give your Potara
over to Goku and Vegeta.

156
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,990
If they unite once again, they
will beat that guy easily, right?

157
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,070
R-Right!

158
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,750
Here, Goku-<i>san</i>, Vegeta-<i>san.</i>

159
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,420
Please use these Potara and
defeat Majin Boo for sure this time!

160
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,970
No, we won't need these.

161
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,970
I'm giving it back.

162
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,890
After all, these, you see, just ain't suited for us.

163
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:43,560
I appreciate the offer,
but I want to fight by myself.

164
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,600
G-Goku-<i>san</i>!

165
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,820
I'm sorry, asking to be
selfish at a critical time like this,

166
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,320
but after all, he ain't merged any more either.

167
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,200
Y-You idiot! What are you
saying, at a time like this?!

168
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,580
Y-You guys aren't in a
sport–fighting match with Boo here!

169
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,210
Th-That's right, Goku-<i>san</i>!

170
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:08,670
Well said, Kakarrot!
I don't need this any more either!

171
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,550
That's the very essence of
the warrior Saiyan people!

172
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,350
C-Can you beat Boo like that?

173
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:25,980
He has gone back to the original,
most difficult, powerful Majin Boo!

174
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,400
It's okay. We'll manage
something! I'm sure of it!

175
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,370
That bastard! How could he?!

176
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,560
<i>Damn it all! I wish he would</i>
<i>hurry and go somewhere else!</i>

177
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,390
<i>I'll be turned into chocolate again...</i>

178
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,030
S-Stop! Stop!

179
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,570
What are you so worked up over?

180
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:23,030
New arrival, huh? If you've
come to train, I'll be your partner.

181
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,410
The training here is pretty tough!

182
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,790
If you're going to give up, now's the time.

183
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,340
You don't have a ring over your head.

184
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,970
If you get him angry, it will be terrible!

185
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,390
Why are you keeping quiet?

186
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,100
How about saying something?

187
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
It's too late!

188
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,450
Dammit! P-Pull a ridiculous
stunt like that, will you?!

189
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,570
All right! I'll pound into you
just how tough the training is!

190
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,460
Got him!

191
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,640
Who is that guy?!

192
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,900
W-What?! Has he not come here for training?!

193
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:23,360
<i>Damn! Shall I test out the</i>
<i>results of my training here?</i>

194
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,740
<i>Kien-zan</i>!!

195
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,160
I got him!

196
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,550
Kuririn! Hurry!

197
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,510
Get out of there!

198
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,890
Awesome!

199
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,310
–Kuririn, are you okay?
–Yeah...

200
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,270
He's not the kind of opponent
we can stand up to in the first place.

201
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,000
See here! What are you
planning to do? Stop that! Stop that!

202
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,590
Boo is planning to destroy
the Grand Kaio's world too!

203
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,380
Th-That's bad! Kuririn and
Yamucha have already died once!

204
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,970
If they die again, then this time,
they'll be completely eliminated!

205
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:32,390
All right! Instantaneous Movement!

206
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,390
Wait, Kakarrot!

207
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,310
Let's call him here!

208
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,400
It won't be so easy, in this holy Kaioshin
Realm, for everything to be destroyed!

209
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,400
We can fight as much as we want!

210
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,570
But how do we do that?

211
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,330
We're the ones he's after! We'll raise
our <i>ki</i> and let him know that we are here!

212
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,660
Th-That's it! All right!

213
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,920
No matter how much we do it, it's no use!

214
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,090
Damn! I'll turn into chocolate, or a
biscuit, or anything you want, just stop!

215
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,900
S-Stop!!

216
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,820
It's all over!

217
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,750
You've had it!

218
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,320
I-It vanished...!

219
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,160
Boo!

220
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,840
It hurts! It hurts!

221
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,550
<i>At last, Majin Boo has come</i>
<i>to the holy Kaioshin Realm.</i>

222
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,510
<i>Having tossed the Potara aside,</i>

223
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:21,310
<i>will Goku and Vegeta be able to</i>
<i>defeat Boo without merging together?</i>

224
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,910
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

225
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,460
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

226
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,050
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

227
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,140
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

228
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,150
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

229
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:14,530
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

230
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,410
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

231
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:27,460
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

232
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,000
<i>Even now?</i>

233
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:36,630
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

234
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:42,060
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

235
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:48,520
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

236
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:58,570
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

237
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,340
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

238
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,760
<i>Boo, we have to defeat you,</i>
<i>for the sake of the universe.</i>

239
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,350
<i>Vegeta, let's play Rock-Paper-Scissors</i>
<i>to decide who goes first.</i>

240
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,680
<i>You idiots! Can't you both fight together?!</i>

241
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,100
<i>This is Majin Boo you're fighting!</i>

242
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,140
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

244
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,400

245
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,450
