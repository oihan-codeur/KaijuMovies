<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,105
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4

<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

6
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:54,745

What is it you're planning?
What are you thinking?

24
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:03,695
Sorry, but no matter what,
I want to fight with him.

25
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:07,695
Both him and me, in the first round,
while we're both at 100 percent strength.

26
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:21,545
<i>The Tenkaichi Tournament</i>

<i>The incredible guy that</i>
<i>Goku was talking about...</i>

<i>...was none other than Oob,</i>

N-Neither my father...

31
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:47,275
...are piles of poo!!

<i>"Even Stronger!!</i>

What?!

34
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:05,545
He's fast!

35
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:49,715
I'm starting to get excited...!

36
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:02,225
There's no doubt about it!
You're the reincarnation of that evil Boo!

37
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:37,595
Come on, come on, what's the matter?

38
00:05:06,585 --> 00:05:09,675
<i>I can't lose! I absolutely cannot lose!</i>

39
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:13,925
<i>I made a promise to Father and</i>
<i>Mother that I would win the tournament,</i>

40
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:17,345
<i>and bring back the prize money for sure.</i>

41
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:20,925
Ain't you coming?
In that case, I'm going to go at you!

42
00:05:41,325 --> 00:05:42,745
Oh, my!

43
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:47,205
Contestant Oob can do nothing in the
face of Contestant Son's ferocious attacks!

44
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:48,585
He is being hammered!

45
00:05:51,915 --> 00:05:55,675
Impressive... Little by little,
he's catching up to my speed!

46
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:07,105
I can't believe it. That kid is learning
how to fight while he is fighting!

47
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,275
What?

48
00:06:44,555 --> 00:06:45,685
You're kidding, right?!

49
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:48,565
W-What is with that boy?!

50
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:51,485
U-Unbelievable...

51
00:06:51,525 --> 00:06:55,655
To think that he's fightin'
on equal terms with Goku-<i>sa...</i>

52
00:06:55,695 --> 00:07:00,405
Can it be that the incredible guy
Son-<i>kun</i> mentioned is this boy?

53
00:07:11,745 --> 00:07:14,165
Nice going! Nice going, kid!

54
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,045
Go! Go!

55
00:07:45,745 --> 00:07:49,165
You're sure it's okay not to watch the matches?

56
00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:51,205
It'll be fine.

57
00:07:51,245 --> 00:07:54,585
After all, it's going to be
either Goku or one of the others,

58
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,675
or you, Boo-<i>san</i>, that
will win their way through.

59
00:07:56,715 --> 00:08:02,555
And Boo-<i>san</i>, there isn't anyone that
can stand up to you and the others, is there?

60
00:08:02,595 --> 00:08:04,135
I get it!

61
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:11,935
What is it?! What is happening?!

62
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,445
W-What?!

63
00:08:42,795 --> 00:08:45,305
They're even! They are even!

64
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:48,765
Both Contestant Son and Contestant
Oob are not retreating one step!

65
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,705
S-Stop this, please!
The ring is being destroyed!

66
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:29,135
Sure enough!

67
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:31,645
It would seem to be just as Goku said.

68
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:33,685
He apparently is the reincarnation of Boo.

69
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:36,515
Yeah, that's the only thing I can figure.

70
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:51,035
Contestant Oob has incredible power!
Even with his small body,

71
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:53,705
he is easily tossing Contestant Son about!

72
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:04,375
This is for what you said earlier!

73
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:12,515
–Grandpa!
–Look out!

74
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:14,725
Grandpa, hang in there!

75
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:19,515
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

76
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:25,025
Son-<i>kun</i>...!

77
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:26,615
Father...!

78
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:43,675
Oh, dear! Is Contestant Son down?

79
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:45,675
Awesome, kid!

80
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:28,465
You really got me that time.

81
00:11:28,505 --> 00:11:31,255
All righty! Come on!

82
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:11,755
What sort of guys are those?!

83
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:16,345
You'd better back out too!
If you don't want to die, that is!

84
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:21,555
Where are you going?

85
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:28,525
Knock-<i>san</i>, are you still going to participate?

86
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:33,485
Yeah... I was only going to the
restroom. I'm just about to leak out!

87
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:44,335
Um... I'm just... uh...

88
00:12:45,795 --> 00:12:48,165
I hear somebody calling for help!

89
00:12:48,205 --> 00:12:50,505
It's the voice of a young girl,
being frightened by evil!

90
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:51,675
Wait right there!

91
00:12:51,715 --> 00:12:58,685
Right now, Captain Chicken, the
Ambassador of Justice, is coming!

92
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:02,645
That makes two people
forfeiting their matches in the finals.

93
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:35,175
I'm not about to lose...

94
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:40,425
I made a promise... I'm not about
to lose... I'm not about to lose...!

95
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:47,725
I'm not about to lose... I'm not
about to lose... I'm not about to lose!

96
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:54,605
I am not about to lose!

97
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,315
Th-That's impossible!

98
00:14:43,785 --> 00:14:45,365
Y-You're floating!

99
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:53,085
<i>Ka... me...</i>

100
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,375
<i>...ha... me...</i>

101
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:01,965
Father!

102
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:21,695
That's right, you still haven't learned
how to fly through the air yet, huh?

103
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:24,865
That's only normal, since
you haven't had a teacher,

104
00:15:24,905 --> 00:15:27,705
and you probably never
even thought about it.

105
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:38,715
I'm sorry about saying those bad
things earlier. Forgive me, okay?

106
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,715
I wanted to know what you were capable of.

107
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:46,185
If I hadn't done so, it didn't seem like
you would have gotten serious with me.

108
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:49,395
Just as I expected, you are
who I thought you would be.

109
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:52,605
You're impressive! Awesome!

110
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:58,195
But you ain't accustomed to using your power.

111
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:02,695
This is the first time you've
ever fought like this, huh?

112
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,445
Let's see, now...

113
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:08,825
All right, I've decided.

114
00:16:08,865 --> 00:16:11,535
I'll go live together with
you at your place from now on,

115
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,545
and teach you how to fight.

116
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:18,175
Once I do that, you'll become much,
much stronger. That's okay, right?

117
00:16:18,215 --> 00:16:22,715
S-Stronger? B-But...

118
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:24,175
What's wrong?

119
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:29,185
That's impossible. Our family is poor, and all.

120
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:33,185
That's why I insisted on
coming here, for the prize money.

121
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,355
No problem, no problem.
Don't worry about money.

122
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,195
I'll get some from Mister Satan.

123
00:16:38,235 --> 00:16:41,115
He makes quite a bit
from being a hero, after all.

124
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,575
B-But...

125
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,575
There's no reason to be so reserved.

126
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:45,745
Besides...

127
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:48,245
From now on, if the time comes
when there's some emergency,

128
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,955
you're the only one who will
be there to protect the peace!

129
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,495
Wait there a second!

130
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:04,755
F-Father!

131
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:11,145
Guess what? I'm going to go live together
with him at his place so that I can train him.

132
00:17:11,185 --> 00:17:14,765
–G-Goku-<i>sa</i>!
–Son-<i>kun</i>!

133
00:17:14,805 --> 00:17:18,735
I don't know how many years it will take,
but I'll come home every once in a while.

134
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:20,735
Look after things for me, okay?

135
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:24,115
U-Um, Father, why in the world...?

136
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:25,735
See ya!

137
00:17:25,775 --> 00:17:27,495
Father!

138
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,155
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

139
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:34,125
–Father...
–Goku-<i>san...</i>

140
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:37,585
Grandpa...!

141
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,665
Grandpa!

142
00:17:44,795 --> 00:17:45,755
What's the matter, Pan?

143
00:17:45,795 --> 00:17:49,095
Is it true? What you just said, is it true?

144
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,475
Yep!

145
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:56,475
No! Not being able to see you,
Grandpa–I don't... I don't want that!

146
00:17:56,515 --> 00:18:01,105
Hey, hey, hey, Pan. It ain't like
we'll never see each other again.

147
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:04,655
I said I would come
home once in a while, right?

148
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:07,695
Really?

149
00:18:07,735 --> 00:18:11,535
Yeah, I promise! So don't cry.

150
00:18:17,585 --> 00:18:19,995
All right, that's a good girl.

151
00:18:21,205 --> 00:18:24,545
Don't you guys skip out
on your training, either, now!

152
00:18:24,585 --> 00:18:26,005
Just like with him,

153
00:18:26,045 --> 00:18:30,715
the peace of the Earth from now
on rests on your shoulders, after all.

154
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:33,555
Right!

155
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:35,685
I'm going to train too!

156
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,565
And I'm going to get a lot
stronger, just like you, Grandpa!

157
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:40,775
All right, that's the spirit!

158
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:45,155
Now, then...

159
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:47,075
Sorry about this, Vegeta.

160
00:18:47,115 --> 00:18:50,655
And after I talked you into
coming all the way out here...

161
00:18:50,695 --> 00:18:54,365
Hmph. In puny matches
such as these, neither you or I,

162
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:57,665
or that Oob kid there, could go at
it to the best of our abilities, anyhow.

163
00:18:57,705 --> 00:18:59,585
Ain't that the truth!

164
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:02,625
See ya!

165
00:19:08,585 --> 00:19:10,715
Well, let's go! Hop on my back!

166
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:13,555
R-Right... L-Like this?

167
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:16,185
Your house was on an
island to the south, right?

168
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:17,185
Yes.

169
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:19,395
Hold on to me tight, Oob!

170
00:19:19,435 --> 00:19:21,565
Right!

171
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:24,565
All right! Here we go!

172
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:25,945
Yahoo!

173
00:19:33,615 --> 00:19:36,575
C-Contestant Son?! Contestant Oob?!

174
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:39,125
What are we supposed
to do about the matches?!

175
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:40,745
–Grandpa!
–He's gone!

176
00:19:40,785 --> 00:19:44,755
–W-What's going on?
–Bye-bye!

177
00:19:44,795 --> 00:19:47,585
–H-He's not serious...
–He can't be...

178
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,795
Training, he says? Hey, what does that mean?

179
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:55,095
He's gone!

180
00:19:55,135 --> 00:19:58,475
What in the world was Son-<i>kun</i> thinking?!

181
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:01,645
Really, he's always done whatever he pleased!

182
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:08,695
It's been a long time since
I've seen Goku as happy as that.

183
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,985
You're right.

184
00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:15,455
Hey, what's going on?

185
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:19,455
Beats me, I don't know what's up.

186
00:20:19,495 --> 00:20:23,165
Kakarrot, I can understand your reasons.

187
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:31,675
You're not training that kid,
the reincarnation of Boo,

188
00:20:31,715 --> 00:20:34,555
just for the sake of keeping peace.

189
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:45,485
So, Oob...

190
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,105
Y-Yes?

191
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:49,655
Once your training is complete,

192
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:53,535
let's you and I have a proper
match against each other again, okay?

193
00:20:53,575 --> 00:20:55,365
O-Okay.

194
00:20:55,405 --> 00:21:01,035
To tell you the truth,
that's what my biggest goal is!

195
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:03,625
Ain't you excited, Oob?!

196
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:06,505
To be able to come across
someone so incredibly strong?!

197
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:07,505
Yes!

198
00:21:07,545 --> 00:21:09,005
Sure you are!

199
00:21:18,385 --> 00:21:20,725
"Cancelled"

200
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:53,045
All right! Let's go get stronger!

201
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:54,675
Yes!

202
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:57,755
No, no! You say "Ohh!"

203
00:21:59,095 --> 00:22:00,555
Ohh!

204
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:04,725
One more time! Let's go get stronger!

205
00:22:04,765 --> 00:22:06,935
Ohh!!

206
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:15,195
<i>Son Goku, the warrior who has</i>
<i>continually fought and overcome limits</i>

207
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:21,785

<i>as the universe, now makes his departure.</i>

208
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:24,575
<i>Come back soon, Goku!</i>

209
00:22:24,615 --> 00:22:29,125
<i>Everyone is waiting for your return!</i>

<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

213
00:22:56,025 --> 00:23:02,115
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

214

215

<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

216
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:18,345
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

217
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:27,435
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>

218
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:28,975

<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

220
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:41,985
<i>There's some mysterious</i>

221
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:48,495
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
