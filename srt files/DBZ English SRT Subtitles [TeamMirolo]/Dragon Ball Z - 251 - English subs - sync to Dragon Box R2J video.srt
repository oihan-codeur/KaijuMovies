00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:24,755
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:30,345
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,105
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:41,695
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,745
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:57,335
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,255
<i>The sky is clear</i>

<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:05,635
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:08,635
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,645
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:20,195
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:23,065
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,655
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,655
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:31,035
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:34,245
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:37,085
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,875
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:46,175
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:57,395
<i>With only a day's training, Gohan</i>
<i>had become able to wield the Z-Sword.</i>

24
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:04,905
<i>In order to ascertain its sharpness,</i>
<i>he tried testing the blade. However...</i>

25
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:28,505
<i>I-Impossibly, rather than cutting through,</i>
<i>the Z-Sword itself was instead broken!</i>

26
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:31,805
<i>A Kaioshin from fifteen generations past</i>

27
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:35,135
<i>appeared before a</i>
<i>crestfallen Gohan and the others.</i>

28
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:42,315
<i>He, who had been sealed within the Z-Sword,</i>

29
00:02:42,355 --> 00:02:46,155
<i>said he was able to draw out a</i>
<i>person's power beyond their limits.</i>

30
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:50,155
<i>Elsewhere, having mastered the Fusion Pose,</i>

31
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:54,995
<i>Goten and Trunks have finally</i>
<i>decided to test out their Fusion.</i>

32
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:03,545
<i>"Birth of a Superhuman Warrior!!</i>
<i>His Name is Gotenks."</i>

33
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:10,845
Fusion! Fusion!

34
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,355
Hey!

35
00:03:22,725 --> 00:03:26,695
Hey everyone, I heard the pee-wees
are about to try out their Fusion!

36
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:29,735
Then the special training is finally over?

37
00:03:29,775 --> 00:03:30,905
Let's go see!

38
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,115
You're going?

39
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,335
Upon merging, they're supposed to
have an enormous <i>ki</i>, and there'd be trouble

40
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:45,005
if the palace were damaged,
so they said they're doing it out front.

41
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:49,675
Once they successfully merge, they're
supposed to become some wildly strong warrior,

42
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:52,635
but how do you suppose they'll look?

43
00:03:52,675 --> 00:03:55,725
Hmm, well, those two little guys
resemble each other quite a bit,

44
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:59,055
so I don't guess they'll
change all that much.

45
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:02,225
Just think if they became
some predisposed macho man!

46
00:04:02,265 --> 00:04:06,645
Their name... What'll happen to
their name, once they're done mergin'?

47
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:12,155
They're Goten and Trunks, so...
Gotenks? Or will it be Trunten?

48
00:04:12,195 --> 00:04:15,655
Naw, either way, it's a deranged name, huh?

49
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:18,205
What are you saying?

50
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:23,295
They'll only be merged for around thirty
minutes, so a name doesn't matter, does it?

51
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:26,505
But, won't we have trouble tryin' to call him?

52
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:35,425
They're doing it, they're doing it!

53
00:04:57,115 --> 00:05:00,665
Trunks, hold your <i>ki</i> down just a bit more.

54
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:04,665
This is tough. Like this?

55
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:09,085
All right! Your two <i>ki</i>
have become utterly identical!

56
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,215
Now then, start the Fusion!

57
00:05:19,675 --> 00:05:21,175
Here it comes!

58
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:35,405
Fusion–

59
00:05:37,155 --> 00:05:38,785
Ha!!

60
00:05:40,155 --> 00:05:41,785
You're kidding!

61
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:50,795
Incredible!

62
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:26,625
–Hey...
–Is that... right?

63
00:06:29,705 --> 00:06:32,675
Th-They can, in fact,
return back to normal, right?

64
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:36,095
I-I can't love that!

65
00:06:36,135 --> 00:06:41,635
Is that really the guy Goku said
might be able to overcome Majin Boo?

66
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:49,145
He doesn't look like it,
but that must be it, huh?

67
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:55,905
S-So that's it! Oh, Goku!

68
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:59,485
An eye for an eye, and a
fatso for a fatso, is that it?

69
00:07:00,655 --> 00:07:03,325
Looks like he's about
to start doing something.

70
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:11,085
He's started running!

71
00:07:28,225 --> 00:07:30,805
That is one complete
and utter failed product.

72
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:33,185
Hey!

73
00:07:33,225 --> 00:07:35,315
I-I knew it.

74
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:42,075
During the "–sion" pose just now,
Trunks had his fingers sticking out!

75
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:45,995
During this point, your hands must be in fists.

76
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:52,415
Okay? You got that?

77
00:07:52,455 --> 00:07:55,375
All right, let's do it over once again!

78
00:07:57,045 --> 00:07:57,465
What are you doing?!

79
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:01,595
Hurry up and return to normal, would you?!

80
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:04,345
How do I return to normal?

81
00:08:10,435 --> 00:08:15,395
There's no use. Shall we wait
for thirty minutes to go by, then?

82
00:08:15,435 --> 00:08:21,615
How strange! You're neither
Trunks nor Goten, are you?

83
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:24,035
Why did your clothes come out that way?

84
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:26,695
Say, what happened to Goten-<i>kun</i>?

85
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,455
Do you have a name?

86
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,125
Gotenks.

87
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:37,005
See? It's Gotenks after all!

88
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:43,755
It's almost thirty mintues.

89
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:56,685
–Trunks!
–Goten!

90
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:00,355
D-Did we do it?

91
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:01,985
I don't know.

92
00:09:02,025 --> 00:09:05,405
Hey, what did that feel like, merging?

93
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:09,575
Don't you remember much about it?

94
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:10,575
Mm-mm.

95
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:13,995
Still, you really were able to merge!

96
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:17,705
Now we see light of hope!

97
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:23,425
Sorry, but I'd like to have you save your
talk until after they've defeated Majin Boo.

98
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:26,425
Right now, we don't have
even a moment to spare!

99
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,765
All right, one more time.

100
00:09:36,605 --> 00:09:39,395
Okay, begin.

101
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:43,315
Fusion Ha!!

102
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,965
Surely a mistake, huh?

103
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,965
You can tell by one look.

104
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:13,345
He hasn't done anything yet,
and already he's exhausted.

105
00:10:14,975 --> 00:10:18,525
This time, during the "Ha,"
your fingers were a bit off.

106
00:10:18,565 --> 00:10:20,315
Let's do it again...

107
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,445
...in another thirty minutes...

108
00:10:37,455 --> 00:10:38,785
All right, begin.

109
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:49,885
Fusion Ha!!

110
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:59,555
That was perfect! He's being born!

111
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:06,355
The warrior who will defeat Majin Boo!

112
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:20,705
W-What?!

113
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:28,545
W-What a storm of a <i>ki</i>!

114
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:32,555
Th-They've done it! They've succeeded!

115
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,975
Incredible, incredible!

116
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:37,515
I can't really tell, but
they must be extraordinary.

117
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:40,355
Lookin' at them, they
do seem pretty awesome.

118
00:11:40,395 --> 00:11:41,815
What are you saying?

119
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:44,525
Even I can tell at least that much!

120
00:11:44,565 --> 00:11:47,565
Incredible! He really has an incredible <i>ki</i>!

121
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:50,195
Okay, this finally turned out right.

122
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,615
Now, in another thirty minutes,

123
00:11:51,655 --> 00:11:55,995
we'll finally have you
achieve this as Super Saiyans.

124
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:58,575
Aren't you underrating me?

125
00:11:58,615 --> 00:11:59,575
What?

126
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,415
I'm enough to defeat Majin Boo just as I am!

127
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,915
Y-You moron! What are you talking about?!

128
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:08,965
You don't know anything
about how frightful Majin Boo is!

129
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:13,265
No matter how incredible you may say
you are, at your level, it's still impossible!

130
00:12:13,305 --> 00:12:16,475
There is absolutely no way
you can prevail against Majin Boo!

131
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:23,315
Don't think that lightly of me! Okay, fine!

132
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:27,025
I'll show you right now!
Majin Boo's body, that is!

133
00:12:31,655 --> 00:12:34,115
W-Wait! Trunten!

134
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:37,745
Er, Gotenks.

135
00:12:38,655 --> 00:12:41,125
This way, huh? Fairly close-by.

136
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,665
In that case, give me thirty
minutes and I'll defeat him

137
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:46,625
and return in time to
give back plenty of change!

138
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:53,965
What speed!

139
00:12:54,005 --> 00:12:55,465
Y-You miserable fool!

140
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:58,975
If you get killed now, everything
will have been wiped out!

141
00:12:59,015 --> 00:13:01,725
H-He was sure an overbearing fellow,

142
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:05,525
but you never know, he may
just be able to defeat Majin Boo!

143
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:08,895
Yeah! He really did
seem sure of himself, huh?

144
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,945
Are you awakening, Goku-<i>san</i>?

145
00:13:52,985 --> 00:13:55,565
Kaioshin-<i>sama...</i>

146
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:02,245
How's Gohan? Has his
power-up been finished yet?

147
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:13,795
Good grief!

148
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:17,385
It has only been two hours.

149
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,765
This ceremony takes five hours,

150
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:21,805
so there should be another three hours left.

151
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:24,805
Hey, Gohan, hang in there!

152
00:14:24,845 --> 00:14:26,605
Come on, Father!

153
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:29,435
Thinking you don't have
anything to do with this...

154
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:49,535
You're not getting away!

155
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:04,135
Majin Boo!

156
00:15:28,825 --> 00:15:34,165
Gotcha, gotcha! Yea! Yea! Yea!! Yea!

157
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:37,385
Help me!

158
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:40,385
H-Help me!

159
00:15:40,425 --> 00:15:41,845
What's this?

160
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:45,055
I-I'm gonna drown!

161
00:15:49,345 --> 00:15:50,895
Thank you so much!

162
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:57,485
–M-M-M-Majin Boo!
–I hate you.

163
00:16:37,775 --> 00:16:40,365
You're quite the tough punk!

164
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:43,365
That was simply my way of saying hello.

165
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:46,745
I didn't think it would
have any effect myself.

166
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:49,285
Who are you?!

167
00:16:49,325 --> 00:16:52,625
Hmph! Since you're going
to be dying here anyway,

168
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:54,875
there's no point in me
introducing myself, is there?

169
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:56,875
Die?

170
00:16:56,915 --> 00:17:00,135
Sorry, but I don't have time
to waste chit-chatting with you.

171
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,295
I'm going to have to
put you away lickety-split!

172
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,715
Why, you...

173
00:17:03,755 --> 00:17:04,885
Here goes!

174
00:17:40,795 --> 00:17:42,375
Take this!

175
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:53,265
Hmph! Fatty! Call yourself a
Majin and that's all you've got?

176
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:56,145
Oh, no! I said I was going to
show them his body before I left,

177
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:58,565
and now I've vaporized it!

178
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:01,775
Well, nothing I can do about that now, huh?

179
00:18:03,905 --> 00:18:05,485
What?!

180
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:27,045
You called me a fatty, huh? Now I'm mad!

181
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:32,635
In that case, what are
you going to do about it?

182
00:18:33,935 --> 00:18:35,725
Gonna kill you!

183
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,225
Sheesh.

184
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:43,275
Too slow!

185
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:46,735
<i>I-Impossible! I should have dodged him!</i>

186
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:50,865
<i>You mean that in that instant,</i>
<i>he was able to read my movement?</i>

187
00:19:36,325 --> 00:19:38,615
Now die!

188
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:56,095
Majin Boo! So long as we of
the defense forces are here,

189
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:58,225
we will not allow you to have your way!

190
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,055
All right, open fire!

191
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:07,315
I-It's no use! He's not an
opponent you can handle!

192
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:08,815
Get out of here, quick!

193
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:33,095
What?!

194
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,675
Everybody, everybody...

195
00:20:35,715 --> 00:20:37,675
Stop!!

196
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:42,975
Now die!!

197
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:50,485
Th-This can't be!

198
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:11,585
Gonna kill more and more!

199
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:22,225
He's come back!

200
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:24,065
G-Goten!

201
00:21:24,105 --> 00:21:25,685
Trunks!

202
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:32,195
I got beaten up all over!

203
00:21:37,285 --> 00:21:38,865
Didn't I tell you?!

204
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:42,705
Listen up, your fight with Majin Boo
comes one more day from now!

205
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:46,085
Until then, you'll train as hard as you can!

206
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:49,465
Once you've gotten even a little bit
stronger, your Fusion will be more effective!

207
00:21:49,505 --> 00:21:52,715
Okay?! You got that, Trunten?!

208
00:21:54,295 --> 00:21:57,265
Er, Gotenks.

209
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:59,265
You got that, Gotenks?!

210
00:22:10,315 --> 00:22:12,105
<i>Fusion was a success.</i>

211
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:16,115
<i>However, its power is still</i>
<i>far from matching Majin Boo.</i>

212
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:21,285
<i>Can Gohan really achieve a power-up?</i>

213
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:24,665
<i>The only ones who can stop</i>
<i>the destruction of the Earth now</i>

214
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:29,375
<i>are Gohan and Trunten–I mean, Gotenks.</i>

215
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:38,845
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

216
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:45,385
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

217
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:55,985
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

218
00:22:56,025 --> 00:23:02,075
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

219
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:09,085
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

220
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:14,465
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

221
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,345
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

222
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:27,395
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

223
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,935
<i>Even now?</i>

224
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:36,565
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

225
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:41,985
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

226
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:48,455
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

227
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:58,505
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

228
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:15,815
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

229
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,815
<i>Now, the moment you've been waiting for,</i>

230
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:19,865
<i>the appearance of the</i>
<i>savior of the earth, Satan!</i>

231
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,735
<i>What is he going to do</i>
<i>against Majin Boo with those?</i>

232
00:24:22,775 --> 00:24:24,995
<i>He's giving him candy and games?</i>

233
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:27,915
<i>Those cheap tricks aren't going to work on him.</i>

234
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:29,705
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

235
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:33,665
<i>"The Final Weapon is Engaged!?</i>
<i>Satan Will Save the Earth."</i>

236
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:38,125
<i>If he's that scared of Majin Boo,</i>
<i>he didn't need to go there.</i>

237
00:24:38,165 --> 00:24:39,585
"Next time"
"The Final Weapon is Engaged!?
Satan Will Save the Earth"
