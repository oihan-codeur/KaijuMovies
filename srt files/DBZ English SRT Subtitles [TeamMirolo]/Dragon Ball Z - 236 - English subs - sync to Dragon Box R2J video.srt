24
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,440
<i>Challenging the Majin to battle alone,</i>

25

A-Awesome! Vegeta is unbelievably strong!

30
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,390
Way to go! Way to go, Papa! You're incredible!

31
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,600
Give him some more! Way to go!
Way to go! Give him more!

32
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,270
<i>Him as well–Vegeta has also</i>

33

<i>H-However, that same Gohan</i>

39
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,160
M-Majin Boo! Impossible!
There's no way my Majin Boo can lose!

40
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,180
Awesome!

41
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,190
He got him! He got him!
He got him! He got him! He got him!

42
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,060
That's my Papa for you!

43

Uh huh! Did you see that,
Goten, my Papa's strength?

44
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,740
Yeah! Uncle is incredible!

45
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,080
Of course he is! After all, he's my Papa!

46

What?

47
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,380
Great! Great! Majin Boo, this time it's our turn!

48

Papa! Go!

50
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,150
He did it! He did it! He did it!

51
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,020
It's true! That was amazing!

52

I-It can't be!

Majin Boo... My Majin Boo...!

54

He did it!

55
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,600
That hurt a bit.

56
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,650
What are you, immortal?

57
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,580
Great! Great, Majin Boo! Get him! Get him!

58
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,420
Why, you...

59
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,390
Why, you...!

60
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,710
Th-This is bad!

Why, you...

63
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,620
I hate you!!

64

G-Get out of there!!

66
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,560

You guys, are you all right?!

68
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,930
That was close, that was close!

69
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,480
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!

70
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,770
Huh? What about Goten?

71
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,710
D-Don't scare me like that, Goten!

72
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,380
Here. Thank goodness, huh, Lizard-<i>san</i>!

73

Papa!!

75
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,440
D-Damn it all!

76
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,900
Hmph! How can this be?!

77
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,740
Y-You're strong, on top of which,
you're immortal... it's ridiculous!

78
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,190
Dirty bastard!

79
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:45,580
You're a tough one!
To think you're still alive!

80
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,000
If only you hadn't defied me, you
could have been such a good servant!

81
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,950
What a shame!

82
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,880
Papa...

83
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,430
Even Vegeta is utterly no match for him...

84
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,980
Gohan is dead, and even Kaioshin,

85
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:20,490
the legitimate ruler over all
the world, has been vaporized.

86
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,990
W-What is to become of this?

87
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,330
Papa... Papa can't lose, right?
Not to the likes of that Majin!

88
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:08,870
You're finished now. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

89
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:15,910
W-What do I do? What the hell
can I do to beat this monster?!

90
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,780
You're one creepy punk!
What are you thinking of doing?

91
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,450
Don't you toy with me!

92
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:18,310
Hmph! I could handle that
scale of attack with my eyes closed!

93
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:19,980
What?!

94
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,840
This is bad!

95
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,190
Oh boy, oh boy! Oh boy, oh boy!

96
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,840
He'll be killed! What the hell
happened to Goku and Gohan?!

97
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,340
A-Are they already dead?

98
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,050
Y-You think my Big Brother would die?!

99
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:39,350
K-Keep it under control, Trunks!

100
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,480
Even if you were to go,
there's nothing you could do!

101
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,350
You'd just die for no reason!

102
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:45,900
You'd only be hurting Vegeta all the more!

103
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,860
No way!!

104
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,070
Trunks-<i>kun</i>!
