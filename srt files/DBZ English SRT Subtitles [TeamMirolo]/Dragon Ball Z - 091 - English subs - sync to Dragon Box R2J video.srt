00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,430
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,050
Didn't I say so? If I use
only half of my max power,

17
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,420
I could turn you into space dust, as I recall.

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,390
Aren't you forgetting
about the <i>Kaio-ken</i> technique?

19
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,230
With Goku as he is now,

20
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,030
he should be able to withstand as
much as ten times his regular power!

21
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,740
Regrettably, what he's using right
now is that very times ten <i>Kaio-ken...</i>

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,210
<i>Not even Goku's ten-fold</i>
<i>Kaio-ken is of any use against Freeza.</i>

23
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,750
<i>Freeza has terrifying,</i>
<i>transcendently evil power!</i>

24
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:57,460
<i>"Showdown!! The Embodiment of Flame</i>
<i>in a 20-Times Kaio-ken Kamehame-Ha."</i>

25
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,520
That's our Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

26
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,560
He's just playing with Goku! Such composure!

27
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,060
W-Who the hell are you?!

28
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,900
W-Who, me?

29
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,410
<i>He's a frog! A frog, I tell you!</i>

30
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,420
<i>Chaan-ge</i>!!

31
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,710
T-Then, this frog is...

32
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,740
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>?

33
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,580
<i>Haven't I been saying so all this time?!</i>

34
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,290
I'll send you all to hell!

35
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:28,750
I'll never get anywhere like this.

36
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,050
Your body is mine!

37
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,390
<i>Chan-ge</i>!

38
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,720
What?!

39
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,390
Piccolo, watch out!

40
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,770
I... I can't... move...!

41
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,940
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

42
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,070
P-Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

43
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,410
W-What happened?

44
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,720
My hands...

45
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,150
My feet...

46
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,220
My body...

47
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,250
Ow! My cheek...!

48
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,360
Yeah! Yeah, yeah!

49
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,070
I'm back in my original body!

50
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:03,040
Ow, ow! T-Thank goodness,
Bulma<i>-san</i>, but it's very dangerous here!

51
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,410
If you don't take cover soon–

52
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,720
Enough already!

53
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,390
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

54
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:57,420
Get over here and save me!

55
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,540
This is getting ridiculous.

56
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,410
You can entertain me a
little bit more, if you like.

57
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,040
What a technique!

58
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,710
As I told you,

59
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,050
If I had to, I could destroy this whole planet.

60
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,750
I am the one who destroyed Planet Vegeta.

61
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:20,040
I-I've had it.

62
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,410
I can't win.

63
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,750
W-What did he do?

64
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,690
H-He's cut the whole planet!

65
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:43,060
N-Never mind that, I have to
wonder if Goku is planning something.

66
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,730
It looks like he's starting
to take a one-sided beating!

67
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,100
He's got no plan!

68
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,440
The fact is, Freeza's power is impossibly
greater than Goku or us could have thought!

69
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,000
You don't have to worry.

70
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,070
I wouldn't kill you instantly
with something like that.

71
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,740
D-Dammit...

72
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,120
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
able to placate my anger.

73
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,540
So, how about Goku?

74
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,210
Even using his upper
limit of a times ten <i>Kaio-ken,</i>

75
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,820
is Son being defeated, Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

76
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:19,090
On top of that, Freeza seems to
only be using half of his power!

77
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,120
T-That can't be!

78
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,030
This is why I told him
that no matter what happens,

79
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,730
he must not set his hand to Freeza.

80
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,080
He has lost!

81
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,090
So, then...

82
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:55,130
What can I do to cause you the most pain?

83
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,060
Should I break your arm? Rip off your ears?

84
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,440
Or perhaps I'll slit your throat.

85
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,780
T-The only thing I can do is pull up
to a times twenty <i>Kaio-ken</i> somehow!

86
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,580
My body may not be
able to handle it, though.

87
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:27,560
But if, like he says, he really is only
using fifty percent of his power now,

88
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,560
there ain't nothing else I can do...

89
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,060
It's much too late for
you to start agonizing.

90
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,830
You're the one who started this, after all.

91
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,780
You will become my toy,
until I grow tired of you!

92
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,050
What's the matter?

93
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:55,220
If you don't resist a little for me,

94
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,420
I will find you unresponsive and get bored!

95
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,090
Hey, hey, the fun is just beginning!

96
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,060
It's much too soon for
you to be going to bed!

97
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,750
<i>It's no use!</i>

98
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,090
How does it feel to become a fish?

99
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,060
Kuririn!

100
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,490
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

101
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,560
G-Goku!

102
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,760
Goku!

103
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,700
Chichi! Where are you?!

104
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,910
Old Man Turtle Hermit! Oolong!

105
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,880
O-Old Timer!

106
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:20,080
Chichi!

107
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:26,220
Goku<i>-sa</i>! Goku<i>-sa</i>!

108
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,160
Father!

109
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,990
Gohan!

110
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:35,130
Father!

111
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,750
W-What?!

112
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,470
Father!

113
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,140
G-Goku!

114
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:59,310
For the future of Gohan,
Chichi, Earth, and Planet Namek...

115
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:02,620
I absolutely must not lose!!

116
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,290
Fifty percent power, he says...

117
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:18,400
Whether those words are a
bluff, or whether they ain't,

118
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,400
all I can do is stake everything
on a times twenty <i>Kaio-ken</i>!

119
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,160
<i>Ka... me...</i>

120
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,160
<i>ha... me...</i>

121
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,430
<i>Ha!!</i>

122
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,790
Damn it to hell...!

123
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:23,890
<i>Now that even his twenty-fold</i>
<i>Kaio-ken was of no use,</i>

124
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,430
<i>is there any chance of victory left for Goku?</i>

125
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

126
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

127
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,860
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

128
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,360
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

129
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,870
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

130
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

131
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

132
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,120
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

133
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

134
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

135
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

136
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

137
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

138
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,410
<i>So sorry.</i>

139
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

140
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

141
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,400
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

142
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,770
<i>This Genki Dama is the</i>
<i>last thing I wanted to use.</i>

143
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,370
<i>There'll probably be too much force to it!</i>

144
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,710
<i>It will be hard not to squash the planet itself!</i>

145
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,210
<i>You're still thinking of trying</i>
<i>some kind of nonsense, are you?</i>

146
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,910
<i>What can you hope to do,</i>
<i>as worn out as you are?</i>

147
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,880
