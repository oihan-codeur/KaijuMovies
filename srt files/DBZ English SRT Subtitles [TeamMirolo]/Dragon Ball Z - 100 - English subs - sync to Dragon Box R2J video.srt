<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,830
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,100
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,420
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:52,290
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,790
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,270
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,780
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:26,730
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,300
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,170
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,110
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,130
<i>As the destruction of Namek continues,</i>
<i>Kaio has called upon Earth's Shen Long,</i>

17
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,140
<i>in order to grant a wish to</i>
<i>return to life everyone who had been</i>

18
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,840
<i>killed by Freeza and his men.</i>

19
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,340
<i>At the same time...</i>

20
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:49,850
<i>The two unimaginable super-powers</i>
<i>held by Goku and Freeza at last collide!</i>

21
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,720
<i>"I Am Son Goku's Son!!</i>
<i>Gohan Returns to the Battlefield."</i>

22
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,170
Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

23
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,840
Are you all right?

24
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,790
Such tremendous power! Still not yet?

25
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,820
Hasn't Shen Long granted the wish yet?

26
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,490
We're counting on you, Shen Long!

27
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,130
Once those who were killed by
Freeza and his ring are resurrected,

28
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:59,840
the Grand Elder should return to life, and
Planet Namek's Shen Long should appear.

29
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,180
This is the only means by which
Goku and the others can be saved now.

30
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,520
Shen Long...

31
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,510
<i>Father, hang in there!</i>

32
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,140
This is terrible!

33
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,180
In three minutes, this planet
will undergo a giant explosion!

34
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,490
Full power!!

35
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,830
<i>What?!</i>

36
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,500
I-It can't be!

37
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,340
Is something the matter?

38
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,500
Father–Father's <i>ki</i> has disappeared!

39
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,840
What did you say?!

40
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,840
How could Father lose?

41
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,510
Then Son<i>-kun</i> is...?

42
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,860
Did you see that? My 100 percent power?!

43
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,830
How about that?! That's what you get!

44
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,000
There was no way someone
like you could have beaten Freeza!

45
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,640
There's nothing else we can do!

46
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,300
You realize that, don't you Gohan<i>-kun</i>?

47
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,010
If we don't escape from here right now...

48
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,310
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

49
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,360
Bulma<i>-san,</i>

50
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,990
take Piccolo<i>-san</i> and
return to Earth ahead of us.

51
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,960
What are you saying, Gohan<i>-kun</i>?!

52
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,970
Freeza intends to wipe out all Saiyans.

53
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:20,500
That means if I return to Earth,
then Freeza will go to Earth next!

54
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,210
You're not, by any chance...

55
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,380
H-Hold on!

56
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,050
Wait!

57
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,850
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

58
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,160
I am my father's–Son Goku's son!

59
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,200
And now I... I will take on Freeza!

60
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,130
You can't!

61
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,500
There's no way you can win!

62
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,480
I'm sure Piccolo<i>-san</i>
would say the same thing.

63
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,480
Bulma<i>-san</i>, take care!

64
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,160
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

65
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,510
Gohan<i>-chan</i>! Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

66
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,940
Chichi<i>-san</i>, our Goku
can't possibly be beaten!

67
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,280
He must surely be winning against Freeza!

68
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,150
He's right, he's right!

69
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,820
On the other hand, don't matter how bad
Goku may be thrashin' on what's-his-mug,

70
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,490
once the whole planet
blows up, he ain't–

71
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,620
Enough of that!

72
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,830
I'll thank you not to be
sayin' such ill-fated things!

73
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,300
My Goku<i>-sa</i> won't be dyin' so easily!

74
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,640
I'm sure he's comin' home in good shape!

75
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,650
I'm sure... I'm sure he's comin' home!

76
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,850
Oh? Sorry about that.

77
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,480
What is the meaning of this?

78
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,480
Have we returned to life?

79
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,480
There's something strange about this!
What's with the ground shaking?

80
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,190
Not to mention the sky being dark.
What in the world is going on?

81
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,190
W-Where am I? Am I alive again?

82
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,700
Hurry, Shen Long! There's no time!

83
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,610
The sky! What's this?

84
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,780
Is this an indication that the
planet is just about to explode?

85
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,460
It looks as though it would be best
for me to get away from this planet.

86
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,830
If I get caught in the blast,
I'll lose even more power sharply.

87
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,170
T-This can't be!

88
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,990
Now, you'll have to face me!

89
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,300
You surprise me!

90
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,470
To think you still had the power to fly so fast.

91
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,470
Just what you'd expect of a Saiyan brat!

92
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,180
You... I'm going to defeat you!

93
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,500
You're going to defeat me, you say?

94
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,140
Are you thinking of fighting me,
Freeza, in your exhausted condition?

95
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,680
You for one are aware of my
overwhelming power, aren't you?

96
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,650
You're so miserable, you Saiyans.

97
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,160
Even when outclassed, you still
can't keep yourselves from fighting.

98
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,460
It's fine with me. This saves
me the trouble of going to Earth.

99
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,840
So then, last of the Saiyans, come at me!

100
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,490
What do you think you're doing?

101
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:11,490
Weren't you going to defeat me?

102
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,490
Or is it that before my overwhelming power,

103
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,020
the only thing you could do was run?

104
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,870
Why, you...!

105
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,820
Now then, what manner
of death do you desire?

106
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,280
<i>J-Just a little longer.</i>

107
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,660
<i>If I can detain Freeza for two minutes,</i>
<i>he'll be gone, together with the planet...</i>

108
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,630
I have succeeded.

109
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:59,540
Whosoever was killed by Freeza and his ring
on Planet Namek have been returned to life.

110
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,170
Thank you for service.

111
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,680
So then, farewell.

112
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,600
He did it!

113
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:03,270
He did it! Everyone has been restored to life!

114
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:05,300
What about the all-important Grand Elder?

115
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,940
How is Planet Namek's Super Shen Long?

116
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,180
They're all right. They should
be all right. The sky is dark.

117
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,320
That's proof that Super Shen Long
and the Grand Elder are back alive.

118
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,190
I'll verify it now.

119
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,660
How is this so?

120
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,030
Why–why am I in the mortal world?

121
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,590
Great! It's just as I figured!

122
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,390
All right!

123
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,930
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, hurry! You have to hurry
and tell him your intentions, or he'll...!

124
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,270
That's right! The Grand Elder's
measure of life will once again...!

125
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,540
I know!

126
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,940
Grand Elder of Planet Namek!

127
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:19,510
I am the Kaio over the Northern Galaxy.

128
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,510
Kaio<i>-sama...</i>

129
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,490
I want you to listen closely
to what I'm about to say.

130
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,340
<i>Just a little bit more time...</i>

131
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,160
Where did all that spirit
you had a moment ago go?

132
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,500
I know! I just thought of something nice!

133
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:21,540
I think I'll put you into
the same grave as your father.

134
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,980
What do you think?
That must make you happy!

135
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,510
You should be grateful for my kindness.

136
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,690
Okay, that put a little
bit more fight into him.

137
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,840
That kid! What is he thinking?!

138
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,180
So that's it!

139
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,860
I've figured out what you were after!

140
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,860
You're stalling for time, aren't you?

141
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,200
That must be it!

142
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,170
You've realized that this planet

143
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,170
only has a few more moments
of its life span left, haven't you?

144
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,510
Y-You...

145
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,980
You, who killed Father and Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

146
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,020
I can't allow someone
like you to go on living!

147
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,180
<i>Masenko</i>!

148
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,090
Hmph. It has to be like this,
or it wouldn't be enjoyable.

149
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,290
Just like a Saiyan.

150
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,630
However, I'm done playing around.

151
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:30,470
You've gone to such
trouble, so let me show you...

152
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:36,510
my 100 percent power,
which is what killed your father!

153
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,330
<i>Father... Piccolo-san...</i>

154
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,460
You're finished!

155
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,010
What?!
