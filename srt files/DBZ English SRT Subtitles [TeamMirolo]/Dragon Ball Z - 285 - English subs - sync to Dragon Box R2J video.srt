<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:36,145
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:41,735
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:54,795
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

25
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:03,605
Do you hear me, people of the world?!

26
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:06,905
Raise your hands to the sky!

27
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:14,995
<i>Vegeta has bet everything</i>
<i>on a Super Genki Dama,</i>

<i>with the assembled Genki of</i>
<i>all of Earth's people. However...</i>

29
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:21,045
Something I don't trust about this, you know?

30
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:25,465
Yeah. Who do they think
is going to raise their hands?

31
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:28,595
It doesn't have anything to do with us, anyhow.

32
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:31,595
W-What was that?!

33
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:33,885
It's your Earth!!

34
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:37,345
How long are you going to act so
spoiled before you're finally satisfied?!

35
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:48,445
I-It's no use any more! Please! Help Boo out!

36
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:50,535
Listen, Earthlings!

37
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:54,365
Why don't you... why don't you
lend us your power for a change?!

38
00:02:54,405 --> 00:02:58,375
<i>Hurry, everyone on Earth!</i>
<i>Send your genki to Goku!</i>

There hasn't been the
least bit of <i>Genki</i> gathered,

42
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:33,365
except for that of Goku-<i>san</i>'s friends.

43
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:37,495
V-Vegeta-<i>san</i>, can't you use a
more polite manner in your request?

44
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:39,495
Nah, that would probably be asking too much.

45
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:43,455
He's like one big lump of pride, after all.

46
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:51,555
P-Please...

47
00:03:51,595 --> 00:03:54,515
W-What was that?!

48
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:59,475
I'm asking you... please, raise your hands...!

49

Vegeta... you're...

50
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:23,625
I-I'm asking you...

51
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:26,465
...please...

52
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:31,505
...raise your hands!

53
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:40,595
M-Maybe I should raise them up and see.

54
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:44,145
H-Hey, don't do that!
It'll definitely make trouble!

55
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:50,025
Don't do that, I said!

56
00:04:58,995 --> 00:05:05,455
I-It couldn't be...! M-My power really was...!

57
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:08,045
Th-There, you see?!

58
00:05:08,085 --> 00:05:10,625
This is a trap of the devil!

59
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:12,425
E-Everyone, be careful!

60
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:14,465
Sounds like it really will suck out your power!

61
00:05:14,505 --> 00:05:16,305
It looks painful!

62
00:05:16,345 --> 00:05:18,595
Everyone, be sure you don't
raise your hands! Don't be fooled!

63
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:22,605
You fool! Who do you think
is going to listen to you?!

64
00:05:22,645 --> 00:05:26,435
Say, this isn't that Babidi
or whoever guy, right?

65
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:28,105
You dirty bastards!

66
00:06:05,475 --> 00:06:09,025
Th-This is bad! The chubby
one is on the verge of dying!

67
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:13,275
Th-This is too awful! Even for
a dream, this is going too far!

68
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:02,035
–Boo!
–Damn, it's all over!

69
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:06,035
Damn it all, I can't take it any more!

70
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,375
What the hell are you doing?!

71
00:07:09,665 --> 00:07:11,335
Stop that, you...!

72
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:19,635
I hit him...!

73
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:22,675
That's not what I...

74
00:07:23,635 --> 00:07:26,225
N-No, s-s-see, I...!

75
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,525
This ain't good!

76
00:07:43,075 --> 00:07:45,655
That dirty bastard! He's found us out!

77
00:07:48,075 --> 00:07:50,995
Kakarrot! I'll do what
I can to buy a little more time!

78
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:53,915
You'll have to convince
those idiots on Earth now!

79
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,965
Buy time, you say? You just came back to life,

80
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:02,545
and ain't got sufficient <i>ki</i> yet, do you?!

81
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:17,105
M-Make fun of me, will you?

82
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,235
Vegeta!

83
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:31,455
K-Kakarrot!

84
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,785
H-Hurry...!

85
00:08:36,665 --> 00:08:40,635
C-Convince those idiots on Earth...!

86
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:45,635
Everybody on Earth! I beg you!
I beg you, share your <i>Genki</i> with me!

87
00:08:45,675 --> 00:08:50,935
We need everybody's help!
Raise your hands to the sky!

88
00:08:50,975 --> 00:08:53,975
Quickly!

89
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,565
N-Noble Father, that voice just now...!

90
00:08:56,605 --> 00:09:01,485
Mm-hmm! We finally learn
the identity behind these voices!

91
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:07,615
It is Son Goku and friends!
They fight for us, against Majin Boo!

92
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:13,415
Can you hear my voice?!
Everyone! Share your <i>Genki</i> with me!

93
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:16,045
It is indeed Goku-<i>san</i>'s voice!

94
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:18,625
Come now, Upa!
Hold your hand toward heaven!

95
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:19,625
Right!

96
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:22,635
Come, the rest of you as well, quickly!

97
00:09:22,675 --> 00:09:26,965
Goku-<i>san</i>, please make
use of our power as well!

98
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:30,685
Geez, what is it with him?

99
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:37,065
From one thing to 'nother, that
guy sure does tough it out, huh?

100
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:41,435
Really, I gotta bow my head to him. Y'know?

101
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:49,195
I see. So that's it, huh?

102
00:09:50,995 --> 00:09:54,955
It's been a while since I've heard his voice.

103
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:59,125
–That one from before, you know?
–Yeah, that was a pretty good one.

104
00:10:00,585 --> 00:10:03,505
Yes, that will do nicely.

105
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:15,145
This is the <i>ki</i> that I have raised up
through all of the training I've done.

106
00:10:15,185 --> 00:10:17,055
Take it all!

107
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:21,525
We're counting on you,
Son Goku! Be sure you defeat Boo!

108
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:26,945
Everybody on Earth! Share more,
even more of your <i>Genk</i> i with me!

109
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:30,535
It's Son Goku! It's Son Goku! Snow!

110
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:34,495
You're right! That's definitely him
all right! That sure takes me back!

111
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:36,535
What? That's Son Goku?

112
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:39,035
Yeah, from back then!

113
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:45,375
We sure are hungry!

114
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:57,055
Now, hurry! Hurry and
raise your hands to the sky!

115
00:10:58,305 --> 00:11:00,975
Hey, the voice on this guy
sounds like he's trustworthy.

116
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:02,485
Don't be fooled by the voice!

117
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:04,355
It's definitely one of Boo's cronies!

118
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:05,905
He's right! It's too suspicious!

119
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:08,525
They haven't been making
their identities clear to us!

120
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:12,235
If we do as that voice says, then
something awful is going to happen to us!

121
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:43,145
It's no use! It just got a
little bit bigger from that!

122
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:18,935
Vegeta!

123
00:12:24,685 --> 00:12:29,655
Don't you have it backward, there?

124
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:34,235
The one who's going to defeat you...

125
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:36,535
...is going to be me!

126
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:55,965
Hurry! Hurry and give me your <i>Genki</i>!

127
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:07,855
Why?! Why doesn't anyone understand?

128
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:13,825
Th-This can't be! Most of the people
on Earth aren't sharing their <i>Genki</i>!

129
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:16,825
They've already been
hammered by Babidi and Boo.

130
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:21,205
Seeing it from the Earthlings' side,
it's only natural they can't trust anyone.

131
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:35,255
All right, let's go into the city too!

132
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:38,925
We'll all split up, and go
around convincing the city's people.

133
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:44,055
Right now, that's the only thing
we can do for Goku and Vegeta.

134
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:47,275
Understood. Let's go right away!

135
00:13:47,315 --> 00:13:48,935
Yeah!

136
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:09,835
Everyone! Please, raise
your hands toward the sky!

137
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:14,425
Please! Raise your hands toward the sky!

138
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:22,265
If we don't, then something terrible
will happen to the Earth again! Please!

139
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:25,645
Please! Please!

140
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:44,655
Mister!

141
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:55,175
This isn't the time to be doing
that! The Earth is in trouble!

142
00:14:55,215 --> 00:14:59,555
Look, enough! You sure are some
annoyin' brats! Stop gettin' in my way!

143
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:04,265
Everyone, raise your hands!
Look to the sky and raise your hands!

144
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:07,305
Here! I'll give you these, so
go off playin' somewhere else!

145
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:11,565
We got these!

146
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:16,815
H-He's here!

147
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:18,155
Run!

148
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:10,705
Hey! Hurry it up, everybody!

149
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:12,835
Don't you care what happens to Earth,

150
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,255
and the rest of the universe,
you stupid bastards?!

151
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:17,835
What was that? Stupid bastards?

152
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,585
That's a pretty insolent attitude
from someone asking for something!

153
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:23,265
Just ignore them. Ignore them.

154
00:16:23,305 --> 00:16:27,845
It could be that the whole Majin Boo
thing never really happened, couldn't it?

155
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:32,685
That's right! It's entirely possible
we've all been hypnotized as a group!

156
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:36,225
That's it, that's it! Oh, well...

157
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:40,405
W-Why, you all...!!

158
00:16:42,695 --> 00:16:44,735
That's enough out of you all!

159
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,655
Why don't you cooperate, already?!

160
00:16:46,695 --> 00:16:51,075
Does this mean you will also not listen
to the request from me, Mister Satan-<i>sama</i>?

161
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,585
It's Satan!

162
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:57,755
Say, that was Mister Satan's
voice just now, Mama!

163
00:16:57,795 --> 00:17:00,255
Mister Satan?

164
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:02,675
Satan?

165
00:17:02,715 --> 00:17:06,675
Hey, that sure was Mister Satan's voice!

166
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:08,845
What does that mean?

167
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:13,685
That's really Satan! It was his voice!

168
00:17:13,725 --> 00:17:17,735
C-Could it be that the one fighting Majin Boo...

169
00:17:17,775 --> 00:17:20,565
is Mister Satan, then?

170
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,825
I'm sure it is! It has to be!

171
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,485
It's our hero, Satan!

172
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:34,285
Th-That's right! I wanted to keep it quiet,
but it's no use, now that the secret is out!

173
00:17:34,325 --> 00:17:37,255
I will defeat Majin Boo for us.

174
00:17:37,295 --> 00:17:40,915
So could you folks quickly lend me your power?!

175
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:47,265
W-Well, we've got no choice, right?

176
00:17:47,305 --> 00:17:50,765
Unless I say it like that,
they won't trust us, after all.

177
00:17:50,805 --> 00:17:55,765
Besides, our first priority is
to defeat Boo there, you know.

178
00:17:55,805 --> 00:17:58,185
I knew it! I knew it! It's him!

179
00:17:59,855 --> 00:18:02,605
That voice was Mister Satan!

180
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:32,265
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

181
00:18:56,615 --> 00:18:59,285
Here it comes, here it comes!

182
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:49,135
I'm beaten. You've got
me beaten, Mister Satan!

183
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:13,745
All right! That's it! Go!

184
00:20:13,785 --> 00:20:17,165
Go!

185
00:20:17,205 --> 00:20:20,535
Go on! Go on!

186
00:21:18,805 --> 00:21:20,765
Just a little bit more until there's a full tank!

187
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:22,145
Just a bit longer!

188
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:25,185
Hold out just a bit longer, Vegeta!

189
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:27,565
Hey! It's still not enough!

190
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:30,105
Is there anyone who
hasn't raised their hand yet?!

191
00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:47,955
I-It's no use...!

192
00:21:58,805 --> 00:22:01,265
It's done! It's done!

193
00:22:05,305 --> 00:22:09,235
<i>After Satan's part, which</i>
<i>nobody had anticipated,</i>

194
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:12,775
<i>the Super Genki Dama is at last complete!</i>

195
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:26,955
Get back, Vegeta! Here it goes!!

196
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:38,845
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

197
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:45,435
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

198
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:56,025
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

199
00:22:56,065 --> 00:23:02,115
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

200
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:09,125
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

201
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:14,505
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

202
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:18,385
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

203
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:27,435
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

204
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:28,975
<i>Even now?</i>

205
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:36,605
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

206
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:42,035
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

207
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:48,495
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

208
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:58,545
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

209
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,605
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

210
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:19,525
<i>Rats! The Genki Dama is finished,</i>
<i>but my strength is failing me!</i>

211
00:24:19,565 --> 00:24:21,775
<i>At this rate, Boo is just gonna push it back!</i>

212
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:23,615
<i>I know! Dende, what about Polunga?</i>

213
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:27,035
<i>Use the third wish to</i>
<i>replenish Kakarrot's strength!</i>

214
00:24:27,075 --> 00:24:28,955
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

215
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:32,745
<i>"Son Goku is Strongest After All!!</i>
<i>Majin Boo is Eliminated."</i>

216
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:38,045
<i>Father's power is back!</i>
<i>The long battle is almost over!</i>

217
00:24:38,085 --> 00:24:39,835
"Next time"
"Son Goku is Strongest After All!!
Majin Boo is Eliminated"
