W-Why, after only two punches...?!

Well then, hurry up and at least fix the mike.

Now what are you going to do?!

43
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,150
Not a thing.

44
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,630
Why, you...

45
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,930
Take this!

46
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,480
H-How can this be?

47

<i>How can I be letting this happen?</i>

48
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,110
All right! I've made up my mind!

49
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,870
I'm going to make that <i>bento</i>
salesboy my number one pupil!

50
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,170
Then, what about our positions?

51
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,170
What happens to us?

52
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,010
You fools! You guys are expressly expelled!

53
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,260
Y-You don't mean it!

54
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,430
How nice for you, Mister Satan!

55
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:08,270
With that boy along, the Satan
Dojo will become even more glorious!

56
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,690
Probably so, probably so.

57
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,110
U-Um, Mister Satan...

58
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,190
The way I see it,

59
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,400
that <i>bento</i> salesboy appears to
have abilities far greater than yours.

60
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,820
No. His fighting style is still too slack!

61
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,540
If I were to coach him in actual combat practice,

62
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,330
I could make him even stronger!

63
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,590
How can he be showing off this
much difference in power against Cell?

64
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,760
I-It's unbelievable, huh?

65
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,180
Gohan...

66
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,170
<i>At that moment, Cell distinctly felt fear.</i>

67
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,920
<i>He then regretted having angered Son Gohan,</i>

68
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,050
<i>and drawing out his true</i>
<i>power, just for the fun of it.</i>

69
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,910
<i>Ka...</i>

70
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,080
<i>me...</i>

71
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,080
<i>ha...</i>

72
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,080
That bastard...!

73
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,420
<i>me...</i>

74
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,470
Take this! A full-power <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>!

75
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,810
If you dodge it, the Earth will be blown away!

76
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,600
You have to take it on!

77
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,350
Don't do it! You've got to be kidding!

78
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,190
<i>Ha</i>!!

79
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,960
I-It's over...!

80
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,460
<i>Ka...</i>

81
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,670
<i>me...</i>

82
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,180
<i>ha...</i>

83
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,180
<i>me...</i>

84
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,020
<i>Ha</i>!!

85
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,570
What?!

86
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,090
I-It's overwhelming...!

87
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,150
<i>That runt! He repelled Cell's</i>
<i>ridiculously large Kamehame-Ha</i>

88
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,440
<i>with an even bigger Kamehame-Ha...!</i>

89
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,040
I can sense his <i>ki</i>!

90
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:28,880
Cell is still alive!

91
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,550
That's impossible!

92
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,210
<i>Sure enough, he's surpassed me.</i>

93
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,420
<i>Ever since that moment, he's</i>
<i>been beyond the Super Saiyan barrier.</i>

94
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,410
<i>That's it, Gohan!</i>

95
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,120
<i>You've gotten so you can</i>
<i>control your ki pretty well.</i>

96
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:56,130
<i>O-Oh, no! I put more power</i>
<i>into that without realizing it!</i>

97
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,270
Come on, Gohan. Let's call it a day already.

98
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,650
We've been at it for 20 hours straight, after all...

99
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,450
F-Father...!

100
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,340
We're done... already...?

101
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,020
<i>What an awesome ki!</i>
<i>He's completely surpassed me!</i>

102
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:15,210
<i>You've surpassed me,</i>
<i>and put Cell away. Well done!</i>

103
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:29,520
H-How...? How can he
have that much power...?

104
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,820
No! Cell has my cells included in his!

105
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,700
He can still regenerate
from that degree of injury!

106
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,280
Gohan!

107
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,530
Gohan, finish him off! Finish him right now!

108
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,160
Finish him already?

109
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,840
It's too soon, Father!

110
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,220
I've got to make this guy suffer some more!

111
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,010
W-What?

112
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,010
What's he saying?

113
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,430
Gohan...

114
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,940
Gohan! You're the only one who
can finish Cell off! Do it quickly!

115
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,610
Don't push him any more!
There's no telling what he'll do!

116
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,600
Dammit...

117
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,570
Dammit... dammit... dammit...!

118
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:04,990
Damn it all!!

119
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:26,380
Not by you...!

120
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,300
There's no way my perfect form
can be beaten by the likes of you!

121
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,200
Why, you...!

122
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,410
He may have increased his power,
but he can't keep up with his speed!

123
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,290
Cell isn't aware of his own mistake!

124
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,120
He's flown into a frenzy!

125
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,490
I-I'm not done yet...!

126
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,090
W-What?

127
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,470
Cell's condition has changed!

128
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,760
It couldn't be...!

129
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,480
That's what it is, all right.

130
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,070
Cell's <i>ki</i> just dropped sharply.

131
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,070
Just as I thought.

132
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,660
He can no longer remain in his perfect form.

133
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,410
What exactly do you mean?

134
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,480
I-Is that...?!

135
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,950
N-No. 18! He threw up No. 18!

136
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,160
The Artificial Human that Cell swallowed...!

137
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,330
It's all over now.

138
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:26,650
<i>Having spat up No. 18,</i>
<i>will Cell's perfect form collapse?</i>

139
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,520
<i>Or something else...?</i>

140
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:48,710
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

141
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,550
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

142
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,930
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

143
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,430
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

144
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,940
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

145
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,030
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

146
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,530
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

147
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,160
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

148
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,670
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

149
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

150
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,590
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

151
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,640
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

152
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,310
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

153
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>So sorry.</i>

154
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,610
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

155
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,620
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

156
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,510
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

157
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,260
<i>Cell is swelling up...</i>

158
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,630
<i>He's going to blow himself up,</i>
<i>and the whole world with him!</i>

159
