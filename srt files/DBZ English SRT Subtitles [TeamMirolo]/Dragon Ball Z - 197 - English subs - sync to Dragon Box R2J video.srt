00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:17,195
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:24,495
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,535 --> 00:00:29,745
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:36,505
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:43,055
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,095 --> 00:00:51,935
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:51,975 --> 00:00:55,435
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,475 --> 00:01:04,445
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,485 --> 00:01:07,905
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:14,035
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:17,415
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:26,385
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:29,935
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:36,815
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:38,775
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:05,845
<i>Goku had come to participate</i>
<i>in the Anoyoichi Tournament</i>

17
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:09,515
<i>that was being held on Grand Kaio's World.</i>

18
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:16,225
<i>The champion was to be</i>
<i>awarded... of all things...</i>

19
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:18,855
<i>personal training by the Grand Kaio himself,</i>

20
00:02:18,895 --> 00:02:23,235
<i>the strongest man in the Next World.</i>

21
00:02:33,075 --> 00:02:36,325
<i>Goku's fighting spirit was fired up...</i>

22
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:42,215
K-Kaio of the South, if I could ask,

23
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,755
when will Contestant
Caterpi hatch from his chrysalis?

24
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:51,595
In about 1200 years, I would say.

25
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:59,685
I-I can't wait, either. Son Goku wins this match!

26
00:02:59,725 --> 00:03:05,065
<i>Goku had safely made</i>
<i>his way past the first round.</i>

27
00:03:05,905 --> 00:03:08,615
W-What just happened?

28
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:16,995
<i>"Grand Kaio's World Gone Wild!!</i>
<i>Goku Kicks Up a Whirlwind."</i>

29
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:31,425
And so, we have safely
concluded the preliminary tournament,

30
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:33,975
and the Best Eight have been decided!

31
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:39,435
The eight martial artists who will
compete in the final tournament are...

32
00:03:39,475 --> 00:03:44,605
From the South Galaxy,
Contestant Furog and Contestant Tolbee!

33
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:51,025
From the East Galaxy, Contestant Aqua!

34
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:56,455
From the North Galaxy,

35
00:03:56,495 --> 00:04:00,285
Contestant Olivue and Contestant Son Goku!

36
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,465
From the West Galaxy, Contestant Malaiko,

37
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:10,835
Contestant Tapica, and Contestant Paikuhan.

38
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:18,345
Go, go, West! Go, go, Paikuhan!

39
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,645
That's what you'd expect
from the folks from our Galaxy!

40
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,355
They're still in this!

41
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:29,945
Don't go bragging just because
you've got one more than the rest of us,

42
00:04:29,985 --> 00:04:31,485
Kaio of the West!

43
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:32,865
W-What?!

44
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,825
What?

45
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:37,285
Now, now, you two, you go saying that,

46
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:39,825
and you have to feel sorry
for Kaio of the East, don't you?

47
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:43,205
She only has one person left, after all.

48
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:44,665
Who asked you?

49
00:04:44,705 --> 00:04:46,835
It's not who has the most
people remaining that's important!

50
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:50,045
Even with only one person,
I can still advance my way up!

51
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:55,345
And so, we now begin the first match!

52
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:59,685
The South Galaxy's Contestant Tolbee versus...

53
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:03,015
The West Galaxy's Contestant Tapica!

54
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:08,605
Tolbee! Give that little
guy a nice, gentle pounding!

55
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:13,865
Underestimate Tapica, and you'll be sorry!

56
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:18,075
–What?
–Tapica, show them a little something!

57
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:53,235
H-He sure is fast! I wouldn't be
able to dodge him at that speed!

58
00:06:04,075 --> 00:06:06,165
H-He's good.

59
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:12,625
Okay then, please begin!

60
00:06:45,495 --> 00:06:47,835
I give up.

61
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,665
I'm exhausted.

62
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:11,855
That ring must have been
exceedingly large for Tapica's little body.

63
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:14,855
Don't offer your commentary so seriously!

64
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:17,905
Okay then, we'll now begin the second match!

65
00:07:23,865 --> 00:07:25,205
Did you get him?

66
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:38,505
All right! At this point, that
move is the only thing I can do!

67
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:09,705
I take on big guys with a bigger body!

68
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:17,875
The South Galaxy's Contestant
Furog is swelling up larger and larger!

69
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,085
What in the world could he be planning to do?!

70
00:08:22,925 --> 00:08:28,395
He's huge. There's all sorts of folks
with different techniques here, huh?

71
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:31,895
The Next World is a big place, all right.

72
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:34,015
Damn! Why, you...!

73
00:08:37,485 --> 00:08:40,905
Keep at it! This is what happens!

74
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:46,075
I'll swell up more and more,
and push you right out of the ring!

75
00:08:46,115 --> 00:08:49,875
W-What's this? Contestant
Furog's aim in growing so large

76
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:54,495
is to push Contestant Malaiko out of the ring!

77
00:09:01,085 --> 00:09:03,965
I'm not about to lose!

78
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:31,825
Incredible!

79
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:46,845
"West"

80
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:50,725
The West Galaxy's Contestant Malaiko wins!

81
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:58,065
Contestant Malaiko proceeds to the semifinals!

82
00:10:00,025 --> 00:10:02,355
Damn!

83
00:10:02,395 --> 00:10:06,195
All right! Next comes my turn.

84
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:14,035
Let's do this!

85
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,505
Moving on,

86
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,795
the third match will be a fight between
the East Galaxy's Contestant Aqua,

87
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:28,805
and the North Galaxy's Contestant Son Goku!

88
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,885
Goku, stick it to him!

89
00:10:32,055 --> 00:10:33,015
What are you talking about?!

90
00:10:33,055 --> 00:10:35,805
Aqua is the one who'll be doing the sticking!

91
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:39,725
Okay then, please begin!

92
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,405
What are you waiting for?!
Don't just stand there!

93
00:10:44,445 --> 00:10:48,735
Go on! Get going! Aqua!

94
00:10:56,915 --> 00:11:01,835
Huh? Could it be that
he's an awfully weak guy?

95
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,925
I've gone and done something terrible.

96
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:08,715
Aqua! Now! Use that technique of yours!

97
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:57,015
Wha–?

98
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:07,145
W-What the...?

99
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:51,775
Aqua, whose specialty is underwater combat,

100
00:12:51,815 --> 00:12:56,155
has the ability to turn anyplace into water!

101
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:58,615
That's cheating!

102
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:04,795
Nope! There's no rule against
turning the ring to water, after all.

103
00:13:04,835 --> 00:13:07,665
That may be so, but...

104
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:36,825
I can'd mobe bery well underwader!

105
00:13:38,325 --> 00:13:39,655
All righd...!

106
00:13:41,705 --> 00:13:43,705
<i>Taiyo-ken</i>!!

107
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:58,715
<i>Ka... me...</i>

108
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:03,595
<i>ha... me...</i>

109
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,895
<i>Ha</i>!

110
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:53,605
R-Ringout!

111
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:59,825
Contestant Son Goku wins!

112
00:15:04,285 --> 00:15:07,495
Goku, you did it!

113
00:15:20,845 --> 00:15:24,425
Geez! You've smeared mud on my face!

114
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:28,645
All of you, 10,000 laps
around Grand Kaio's World!

115
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:36,525
Don't you "oh-oh" me!

116
00:15:38,485 --> 00:15:41,995
You sure are strong, huh?

117
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:46,075
If you'd put me in the water
once again, I might have lost.

118
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:50,085
I'll win next time.

119
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,995
You bet. Let's do that again.

120
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:03,555
What are you doing?! Get going right now!

121
00:16:06,555 --> 00:16:10,645
And now, the last match of
the Best Eight is coming up!

122
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:13,815
The North Galaxy's Contestant Olivue,

123
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,895
and the West Galaxy's Contestant Paikuhan!

124
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:28,535
Olivue-<i>chan</i>! Paikuhan-<i>chan</i>!
Good luck to both of you!

125
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:30,665
The West Galaxy's Contestant Paikuhan,

126
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,165
who is highly favored to be the champion,

127
00:16:32,205 --> 00:16:34,835
and the North Galaxy's Contestant Olivue!

128
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,965
Both competitors in this battle are veterans!

129
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:40,425
It looks like we can
count on a magnificent fight!

130
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:44,515
Olivue! Olivue!

131
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:47,265
Paikuhan! Paikuhan!

132
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:51,015
Olivue! Give it your all!

133
00:16:51,895 --> 00:16:57,315
Ha! You fool! There's
nobody that can beat Paikuhan!

134
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:59,525
It's useless to even cheer him on!

135
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:04,035
What?! You don't know that about Paikuhan!

136
00:17:04,075 --> 00:17:08,155
How about you wait to say that
until after you've seen them fight?!

137
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:14,085
Ah! I'll say it as much as I want!
So much so that after Paikuhan has won,

138
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,085
you'll have calluses on your ears!

139
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,755
<i>Why, you...</i>

140
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:23,335
N-Not even I can see them! Awesome!

141
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:26,335
They're awesome!
Both Paikuhan and Olivue!

142
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,425
So this is the power the martial
artists have in the Next World, is it?

143
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:34,035
R-Ring–

144
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:48,755
Since I was out of the ring,
there's no need for me to say this...

145
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:54,095
but I still wanted to say it. I am defeated.

146
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,095
You've beaten me decisively.

147
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:14,865
C-Contestant Paikuhan wins!

148
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:30,465
Well, Goku-<i>chan</i>, what do you think?

149
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:34,885
A-Awesome...! My body is shaking...!

150
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:38,805
Are you afraid? Well,
you're a newcomer, after all.

151
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:41,845
You probably can't help but feel that way.

152
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:46,105
That ain't it. I'm all excited!

153
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:49,235
What?! Excited, you say?!

154
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,195
That's great, Goku-<i>chan</i>!

155
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:11,165
T-To think that I could fight
against someone that strong...!

156
