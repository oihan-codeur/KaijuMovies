00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,330
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,050
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,680
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,980
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,730
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,320
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,200

<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,620
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,620
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,620
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:20,170
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,050
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,640
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,640
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,020
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,190
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,860
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,120
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,670
<i>To become the mightiest of Majin,</i>
<i>Boo absorbed Gotenks and Piccolo!</i>

24
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,520
<i>Majin Boo and Gohan's</i>
<i>ferocious battle continued...</i>

25
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,470
Not yet, not yet!

26
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:50,510
As long as I have time remaining,
I will have you entertain me!

27
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,520
<i>Elsewhere, as Goku returned to life</i>

28
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,060
<i>in exchange for the life of the elder Kaioshin...</i>

29
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,190
Here! Put one of these
Potara earrings on your left ear.

30
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,950
Have Gohan place the
other one on his right ear.

31
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:19,380
Just by doing that, you two can
combine together, like you were in Fusion.

32
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,920
<i>What will come of the Potara, mysterious</i>
<i>items received from the elderly Kaioshin?</i>

33
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,640
<i>"The Miracle Happens Once... Will the</i>
<i>Super Combination With Gohan Come About?"</i>

34
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,070
Can we really combine just by
putting on these Potara things?

35
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,530
Of course you can! And the
effect is even greater than Fusion!

36
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,240
These are the treasures we Kaioshin

37
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,030
have kept up our sleeves
since long ago, you know!

38
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:53,580
I-I did not know...

39
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,250
There really is no helping the folks nowadays.

40
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,630
That's why you've gotten
so weak, for a Kaioshin.

41
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,420
Kibit, did you know about this?

42
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,500
No.

43
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,090
Look, just try it out!
You've got them too, right?

44
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,510
Kibit, you take off your left one.
I will do my right one...

45
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,600
R-Right.

46
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,150
We're going to hit each other!

47
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,340
I-Incredible! This is incredible power!

48
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,590
W-Whoa...!

49
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:56,020
Goku-<i>san</i>, I can fight too like this!
Let us go to Earth together!

50
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't get carried away!

51
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,100
No matter how strong
you may have become,

52
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,100
you're still nothing special, at best!

53
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,650
You're bound to be
absorbed by Boo. You stay here.

54
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,110
O-Okay...

55
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,110
These certainly are awesome, old timer!

56
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,410
So, how long can we stay combined?

57
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,710
The Potara don't have that
sort of shortcoming! It's forever!

58
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,670
There's nothing to return
you back to normal again!

59
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,500
Never... return?

60
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,090
What a fix... Staying combined
with Gohan that whole time...

61
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:36,510
If it were possible, then
I for one would have returned...

62
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,060
You mean to say, old-timer, that you
combined with someone using the Potara?

63
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,060
Y-Yeah.

64
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,070
A long time ago, I used to be more handsome.

65
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,610
Then this nasty old witch took my
Potara when I wasn't paying attention...

66
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,080
What's this, an earring?

67
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,580
And here you're a man!
Let me borrow this for a second!

68
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,540
This sort of thing is more
suited to a pretty gal, like me.

69
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,470
...Which is how I came to
be like this. And, as a result,

70
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,220
I'm also able to do some
mysterious things, as you've seen.

71
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,010
Well, I guess it's this or nothing.

72
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,480
I wonder if perhaps, once peace is restored,

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,480
I'll have to start going
to Gohan's school like this.

74
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,140
What's the matter? Are you finished now?

75
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,650
D-Dammit!

76
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,530
W-What's going on?

77
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:16,280
I-I do not know. Gohan-<i>san</i> seems to
be getting considerably knocked around.

78
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,080
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

79
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,500
It's okay! I will heal you!

80
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,520
You're all worn out! I'm getting tired of this.

81
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,850
It's just about time I finish you off.

82
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,690
What's that guy doing?!

83
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,400
Gohan-<i>san...</i>

84
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,700
Dende...

85
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,080
Thank you, Dende!

86
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,410
Impossible! He's been restored to
the way he used to be! Who is that runt?!

87
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,920
The size of your <i>ki</i> has not changed.

88
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,630
It doesn't appear as if
you have powered up any.

89
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,010
You've just slightly prolonged
the time you will spend suffering!

90
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,380
Damn...!

91
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,150
While I'm at it, that annoying runt as well!

92
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,440
Oh, no!

93
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,070
D-Dammit, I'll shoot it down!

94
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:45,640
H-How's that?! Do you see
now, the power of my .45?!

95
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,430
W-Who's there?

96
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,620
T-Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>!

97
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,500
So, it was you, Gohan.
You've gotten tougher, huh?

98
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,960
Unbelievable. I didn't recognize you.

99
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,210
I'm surprised at the
change in Majin Boo, as well.

100
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,510
So, the annoying small
fry have increased again?

101
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,630
Nevertheless, small fry are,
after all, still small fry!

102
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,840
<i>Kiko-ho</i>!!

103
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,410
That didn't hurt in the least.

104
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:37,540
I-It's hopeless! Our dimensions are
too different! I won't be any help at all!

105
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,250
Shall I get around to settling this now?

106
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:53,390
I'll destroy the whole Earth, and
you small fry along with it, with this!

107
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,930
Try to avoid it, if you can!

108
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,270
F-Forgive me, Majin Boo! Die!!

109
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:29,470
Oh, yeah! Should I use these Potara
things after I've turned Super Saiyan?

110
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,600
No. Don't do anything you don't have to.

111
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,480
Once you've combined using the Potara,
you're going to be like that a long time.

112
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,350
That Super Saiyan thing
is too hard on the body.

113
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,520
You'd probably shorten your own lives.

114
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,650
Ah, really?

115
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,450
If you're going to become Super Saiyan,
it's better to do it after you've combined.

116
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,160
And even if you don't do so,

117
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,450
the power from just the
Potara should just be enough.

118
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,000
Wow, that'd be great.

119
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,670
That's right. You can only
use the Potara once, after all.

120
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,290
You can't do it over and over. Got it?

121
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:09,090
Goku-<i>san</i>! This is awful! Majin Boo
is planning to finish everything off!

122
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,680
Oh! You're right! This is bad!

123
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,470
Hurry, Goku-<i>san</i>!

124
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,840
Well, bye!

125
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,860
Everything, be gone!!

126
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,910
I-I'm sorry, Majin Boo!

127
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,690
F-Father...? What are you
doing in the lower realm?

128
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,710
Boo's body has been torn apart...

129
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:29,090
Th-They were my bullets.
Forgive me! I had no choice!

130
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,590
Majin Boo! Forgive me...!

131
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,680
I'm sure I've met you before.

132
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,060
That's it. You're the guy that
did those odd transformations.

133
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,690
Now what? Have you come,
planning to help? Ridiculous.

134
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,020
Don't you understand that fundamentally,

135
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,110
I am on a different
dimension now than I was then?

136
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,620
Act all big now, while you can!

137
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,540
I'm using a little item here
that gives an exceptional power-up!

138
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,410
What?

139
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:11,130
Of all the things you might have said...!

140
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,600
W-Why, you...!

141
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,620
That guy just now also appears to
be quite an expert, but with one kick,

142
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,120
that's how he ends up.

143
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,040
An exceptional power-up item, you say?
What nonsense! You're exaggerating!

144
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,590
To be frank, no matter what you might do,

145
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,630
there's absolutely no way
you can even damage me!

146
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,140
You sure hurried to put your body back
together, considering that, didn't you?

147
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,520
You're not thinking something
is going to happen, are you?

148
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:14,020
Small fry! You sure seem to
want to get killed! Very well!

149
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,200
Gohan! Here!

150
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,160
Pick it up! Gohan! Hurry!

151
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,130
Right!

152
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:35,050
Put that on your right ear!
You'll combine with me, and we'll defeat Boo!

153
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,670
W-Where is it?!

154
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:42,680
What?! Combine with him? So that's it!

155
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,680
Even if you do so, I think it'll be worthless,
but just to make sure, let me intervene.

156
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,020
I'm going to kill you first!

157
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,570
T-T-Time out for a second! Wait, please!

158
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,030
That stupid lunk!

159
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,030
It's hopeless!

160
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,110
Here goes!

161
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,610
D-Dammit!

162
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,080
It's useless!

163
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Gohan!

164
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,250
Find it right away!

165
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,420
Right!

166
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,720
Here it is!

167
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:48,330
Damn!

168
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,950
You're not that bad.

169
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,310
Where is it?! Where is it?!

170
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:15,480
Now to finish you!

171
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,380
N-No, dammit!

172
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,600
S-So that's it!

173
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,980
The half-pints have returned
to normal from their Fusion!

174
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,600
Piccolo is coming out strongest!

175
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,980
You ran out of time! Too bad for you!

176
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,690
Boo, your power has dropped quite a bit!

177
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
Here it is!

178
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,120
Father!

179
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,830
Th-This is Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>'s, right?

180
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,670
What was I supposed to do with it again?

181
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,050
H-Huh?

182
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,680
That's a bit disappointing.

183
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,390
With you like this now,

184
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,680
Gohan can beat you without going
to the trouble of combining with me!

185
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,070
It's a good thing I took out
some insurance, just in case!

186
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,730
Insurance? What do you mean?

187
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,790
This part that was cut off. Why do you
think I haven't returned it to normal?

188
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,600
D-Dammit, no!

189
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,940
Th-This can't be!

190
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,460
Y-You just can't do that, you know!

191
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,310
That's it! It's all over!

192
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,980
What will happen?

193
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,810
I don't know.

194
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,580
This is great! I'm much
more powered-up than before!

195
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,370
But this time, there is no time limit!

196
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,630
I-I can't combine with Gohan now!

197
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:29,970
I-It's no use! I'll have to
do it with someone else...!

198
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,340
T-Tenshinhan is down...

199
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,480
M-Mister Satan?

200
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,010
<i>At length, Majin Boo has also absorbed Gohan!</i>

201
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,680
<i>Will Goku's merging companion</i>
<i>be Mister Satan after all?</i>

202
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,680
<i>What will you do, Goku?!</i>
<i>Can you beat Majin Boo?!</i>

203
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,570
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

204
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,160
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

205
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:55,720
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

206
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,850
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

207
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,860
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

208
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,240
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

209
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,120
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

210
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:27,170
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

211
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,710
<i>Even now?</i>

212
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:36,340
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

213
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,720
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

214
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,230
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

215
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:58,280
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

216
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,460
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

217
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,680
<i>Hurry up and put that Potara on, Vegeta!</i>

218
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,640
<i>What are you making a fuss for?</i>
<i>Everyone has been devoured by Boo!</i>

219
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,310
<i>What are you waiting for? Hurry!</i>

220
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,190
<i>If you guys lose now, it will</i>
<i>mean the end of everything!</i>

221
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,310
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

222
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,860
<i>"Merged!! Vegeta's Pride And Goku's Rage."</i>

223
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,240
<i>All right! It's the birth of</i>
<i>the invincible hero, Vegetto!</i>

224
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,360
"Next time"
"Merged!! Vegeta's Pride And Goku's Rage"
