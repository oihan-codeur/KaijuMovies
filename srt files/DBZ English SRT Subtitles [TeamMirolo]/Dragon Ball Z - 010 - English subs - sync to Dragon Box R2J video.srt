<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:52,300
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:04,820
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,290
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,310
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:37,180
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,420
<i>Day by day, Gohan continues to grow.</i>
<i>However, he still has far to go.</i>

17
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,250
<i>The Saiyans arrive in eleven months.</i>

18
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:54,490
<i>"Don't Cry, Gohan! His First Fight."</i>

19
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,660
Oh, no! It's night already!

20
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,290
All right, now...

21
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,660
Mother!

22
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,660
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt!

23
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,660
This is what works best.

24
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,940
No, Father! Let's go
home and take some medicine!

25
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,040
It'll be fine. Here.

26
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,140
It hurts! It hurts!

27
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,990
All right, one more to go!

28
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,670
<i>Looks like it's all over.</i>

29
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,070
<i>I would've liked to have gone</i>
<i>up against that guy one more time.</i>

30
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,440
<i>Oh, well...</i>

31
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,240
You're not very cheerful, huh?

32
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,650
You, huh?

33
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,120
Hitting three consecutive
home runs is incredible, isn't it?

34
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,970
Is there something
you're not satisfied with?

35
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,970
I'm not a baseball player.
I'm a martial artist.

36
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:02,070
I know that, but unless you have
a job, you can't make a living, right?

37
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,050
All right! Lucky, lucky! Yamucha<i>-san</i>?

38
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,060
After the next guy, you'll be up!
I'll be counting on you to smash it!

39
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,730
There's a bonus in it for you!

40
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,830
Sure. Just leave it to me, coach.

41
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,640
I'll be sure to hit a
home run, just you watch.

42
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,640
<i>T-Two million zeni?! Damn, that's a lot...</i>

43
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,040
I'm counting on you!

44
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,780
Sure, sure.

45
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,060
That's pretty demanding...

46
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,730
Play ball!

47
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,270
I don't care... if it...
hurts you... let him hit you!

48
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,870
Get hit by the pitch...
and load the bases!

49
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,120
Strike!

50
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,850
So that's it, huh?

51
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,890
If you want to get hit so badly!

52
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,440
D-Dead ball!

53
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,210
W-Why, you! You hit
me on purpose, didn't you?!

54
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,950
Don't give me that!
You were trying to get hit!

55
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,120
Why you bastard!

56
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,750
You want to go at it?!

57
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:27,020
You mustn't, Yamucha<i>-sama</i>! If you
go in there, people are going to get hurt!

58
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,020
It'll be okay! I'll go
easy on them, okay? Ha-ha!

59
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:35,730
Ha-ha... But still...

60
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,900
Here, here! Here! Here!

61
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,210
You bastard!

62
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,140
Here, here!

63
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,540
<i>This one can handle himself!</i>

64
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,140
Kuririn!

65
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,510
Nice to see you after so long.

66
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,550
But why?

67
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,520
I'll explain it all later.
In any case, please come with me.

68
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,160
What?! You say Goku has died?!

69
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
Him and this Saiyan both lost to each other.

70
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,260
But still, that's just like Goku.

71
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,400
Goku...

72
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,240
Oh, but please don't be
all that worried about him.

73
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,500
We can bring him back to life
with the Dragon Balls, after all.

74
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,740
Come on, hurry!

75
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,980
This isn't good, Yamucha<i>-sama.</i>

76
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,020
She's still mad about you
standing her up on your last date

77
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,750
because you didn't have any money.

78
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:39,560
T-This doesn't necessarily mean that
things are all patched up between us, okay?

79
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,760
This is a state of emergency, so I'm
just working together with you temporarily.

80
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,930
Yeah, I know that much.

81
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,900
If you were to apologize,
though, that would be another story.

82
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,880
Who, me? It doesn't bother me that
I'm not together with everyone else!

83
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,010
I don't care who comes attacking,
I can take them on myself well enough.

84
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,750
T-That might be so,
but it would be a shame!

85
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,950
Kami<i>-sama</i> said he was going to
specially train us up in the Heavenly Realm!

86
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,960
What?! Really?!

87
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,130
<i>T-Training with K-Kami-sama?!</i>

88
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:19,070
That's okay. You don't have
to come if you don't want to.

89
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,740
W-What are you doing? Let's go, Pu-Erh!
Don't dawdle around! Come on, come on!

90
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,970
Ooh, that hurts!

91
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,310
I wonder how many days it has been.

92
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:11,220
If I don't step on it, a year will
have gone by just like that. All right...

93
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,190
Help!

94
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,890
But then, no one's going to help me.

95
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,730
I can't run away here.

96
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,580
That looks painful!

97
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,290
Don't be scared, don't be scared.

98
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,090
All right, now...

99
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:38,430
Ready, set... come on, you!

100
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,790
Ooh, yow... yow...

101
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,330
You mean it was stuck in this deeply?

102
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,970
I've got it!

103
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,580
Just hold on. It's almost done.

104
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,880
See?

105
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,820
It doesn't hurt, it doesn't hurt.
This is what works best!

106
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:58,010
Here. This ought to be enough–

107
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,090
Sure enough, it's just like I read in books.

108
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,440
There are dinosaurs that
don't eat meat. All right, then...

109
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,890
It's been a long time
since I've been this fired up!

110
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,390
The fighting is going to start up again, huh?

111
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,660
And there's only a slim hope of us winning.

112
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,430
No, that's not necessarily so!
This time, we'll have Piccolo,

113
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,170
and Goku should be coming
back to life even stronger, after all.

114
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,610
On top of all that, we're going to be
able to undergo Kami<i>-sama</i>'s training!

115
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,310
T-That's right, huh?

116
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:09,310
Depending on how our training goes,
even we can still become stronger!

117
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:13,920
All right, let's do it! I don't
care who these Saiyan guys are,

118
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,290
I'm going to make sure that
<i>they're</i> the ones who are beaten!

119
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,420
That's the spirit, Yamucha!

120
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,300
What's this? They're
getting along fine after all.

121
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,100
Don't be jealous, don't be jealous!

122
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,340
Must be nice...

123
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,860
I know! Once he's feeling better...

124
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:07,240
Great! That'll be great!

125
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,810
I've gotten quite a bit stronger too, huh?

126
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,560
All right, then!

127
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,710
All right!

128
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,890
It's no use.

129
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,900
I'm back!

130
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,820
Here, I've got lunch! But this time,
leave some for me, okay? Don't eat it all–

131
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,940
You, huh?!

132
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,680
Let go of him! He's hurt!

133
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,960
Let him go!

134
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:11,530
Shoot!

135
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:10,750
<i>Gohan learns for the first time</i>
<i>how harsh the laws of nature are.</i>

136
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:17,320
<i>However, he cannot shrink back now.</i>
<i>The Saiyans will not wait for him!</i>

137
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

138
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

139
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,870
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

140
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,370
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

141
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

142
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,950
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

143

<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

144

<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

145
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

146
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,700
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

147
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

148
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,600
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

149
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,280
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

150
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,450
<i>So sorry.</i>

151
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

152
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,530
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

153
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,570
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>
