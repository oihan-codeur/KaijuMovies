...the most important thing about me.

22
00:02:26,865 --> 00:02:28,795
You guys lose!

23
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:47,005
You certainly have achieved
quite an increase in power.

24
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:50,615
However, it is still not
enough to overpower us.

To say nothing of myself,

26

at your level, it is unlikely
you could defeat even No. 19.

00:05:10,455 --> 00:05:13,255
Ooh, nice...

31
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:14,925
Awesome!

32
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:20,225
I hope everyone's okay.

33
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:23,435
Hi! Is Kurin<i>-chan</i> there?

34
00:05:30,275 --> 00:05:33,275
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, it's me!

35
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:38,275
Oh, if it isn't Maron<i>-chan</i>!

36
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:47,285
Say, where's Kurin<i>-chan</i>?

37
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:53,465
There's nothing like the real thing...

38
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:57,295
Oh, yeah!

39
00:06:02,245 --> 00:06:05,835
How's about a <i>pafu-pafu</i> or a <i>tsun-tsun</i>?

Once I lost true love, I understood it...

42
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:31,035
The only one I ever truly loved...

43
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,675
Was Kurin<i>-chan.</i>

44
00:06:38,675 --> 00:06:40,875
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

45
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:45,245
Kurin<i>-chan...</i>

46
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:51,915
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, where are you?

47
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:54,525
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, where are you?!

48
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:58,125
Kurin<i>-chan...</i> Kurin<i>-chan...</i>

49
00:07:00,635 --> 00:07:02,395
Where are you?

50
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:06,835
Uh, Kuririn<i>-san</i> is currently
in a battle to defeat the people...

51
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,835
...created by the last of the Red Ribbon Army.

52
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:13,405
Red Ribbon? Oh, I get it!

53
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:18,885
Kurin<i>-chan</i> is going to give me
the red ribbon as a present, isn't he?

54
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:28,025
...and if things were to continue that way,

55
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:30,795
the Earth's future would be all messed up, see?

56
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:32,595
That's what the boy...

57
00:07:32,635 --> 00:07:37,235
...who came back from the future
world in the time capsule told us.

58
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:41,435
In order to save the Earth
from this crisis, Kuririn has...

59
00:07:41,475 --> 00:07:45,435
....gone off to fight these people that were
created by a survivor of the Red Ribbon...

60
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:48,275
Maron doesn't get any of this.

61
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:54,815
Well, why don't we let someone of
my age and wisdom explain it to you.

62
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:57,455
See now, do you know what
the Red Ribbon Army was?

63
00:07:57,495 --> 00:07:59,455
What was the Red Ribbon?

64
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:03,485
Aah, you naughty old turtle man!

65
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:09,735
<i>This all has to do with a</i>
<i>time when Goku was still a child.</i>

66
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:15,265
<i>Goku had gone on a journey to both</i>
<i>train himself and search for the Dragon Balls.</i>

67
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:29,955
<i>At that time,</i>

68
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:33,655
<i>there was this terrible military outfit</i>
<i>calling themselves the Red Ribbon Army,</i>

69
00:08:33,695 --> 00:08:37,025
<i>who were determined to conquer the world.</i>

70
00:08:37,065 --> 00:08:39,625
<i>Their boss, Commander Red,</i>

71
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:44,435
<i>was gathering the Dragon Balls</i>
<i>to serve his evil purposes.</i>

72
00:08:44,475 --> 00:08:46,635
<i>Goku fought successively...</i>

73
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:51,075
<i>...against a number of Red Ribbon</i>
<i>operatives who attacked him.</i>

74
00:08:55,715 --> 00:09:00,155
I took his face off!
Have I done something bad?

75
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:48,285
<i>And then, Goku attacked the Red</i>
<i>Ribbon's headquarters all by himself!</i>

76
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,735
<i>And that's how the Red</i>
<i>Ribbon Army was vanquished.</i>

77
00:12:44,775 --> 00:12:48,105
<i>At least, everyone thought they were vanquished.</i>

78
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:51,915
<i>But there was someone who had survived.</i>

79
00:12:51,955 --> 00:12:54,845
<i>Doctor Gero, a maniacal scientist,</i>

80
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:59,385
<i>secretly continued his research even</i>
<i>after the fall of the Red Ribbon Army.</i>

81
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:33,055
<i>As such, he created these Artificial Humans,</i>

82
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:36,255
<i>whose only desires were to kill and destroy,</i>

83
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:39,055
<i>intending for them to be</i>
<i>the ultimate murder weapon.</i>

84
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:43,295
<i>Those Artificial Humans are now running amuck.</i>

85
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:06,285
So now Kuririn is assisting
Son Goku and his other friends...

86
00:14:06,325 --> 00:14:12,125
...in the fight against those
Artificial Humans on that southern island.

87
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,135
Do you understand now, little lady?

88
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,535
Maron doesn't get it at all.

89
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:25,705
I feel it! What an incredibly large <i>ki</i>!

90
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,045
It's Father's <i>ki.</i>

91
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:29,675
Right. But there's only one.

92
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:33,085
I guess we really can't sense
any <i>ki</i> from the Artificial Humans.

93
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:54,065
Incredible. Such strength!
So that's a Super Saiyan?

94
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:57,545
It's a whole different dimension
from the rest of us. Far different.

95
00:14:58,675 --> 00:15:00,545
I'm not so sure...

96
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:49,285
<i>His increase in power is much</i>
<i>greater than our data forecasted.</i>

97
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:52,055
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

98
00:15:52,095 --> 00:15:56,695
<i>This isn't good! At this rate,</i>
<i>No. 1 9 will expend all of his energy...</i>

99
00:15:56,735 --> 00:15:58,505
<i>...before he can steal any additional power!</i>

100
00:16:02,105 --> 00:16:04,075
There they are!

101
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:05,105
Okay!

102
00:16:10,115 --> 00:16:11,715
Father!

103
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:15,915
Don't worry, Goku's strength is incredible!

104
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:18,115
Especially as a Super Saiyan.

105
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:48,685
Incredible! Goku sure is strong!

106
00:16:48,725 --> 00:16:54,125
Really. Maybe I was wrong about
them being able to drain one's energy.

107
00:17:01,735 --> 00:17:05,095
Have you noticed it too, Gohan?

108
00:17:05,135 --> 00:17:06,095
Yes.

109
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:10,105
Son Goku is rushing this fight for some reason.

110
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:13,105
He's acting as if he's
already near his full power.

111
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,675
So why is he making such a mess of things?!

112
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:20,285
Mess of things? Mess of things?
What are you saying?

113
00:17:20,325 --> 00:17:22,725
Goku's got him completely at his mercy.

114
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:30,895
This is nothing! As a Super Saiyan,
Goku should be much more powerful!

115
00:17:30,935 --> 00:17:32,895
Um, Yamucha<i>-san</i> says...

116
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:36,695
...that those Artificial Humans
are able to absorb energy.

117
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,695
Could that be the reason?

118
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:41,065
What? They absorb energy?!

119
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:44,075
Yeah. I had my face grabbed by one of them.

120
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:46,075
Then, without anyone doing anything,

121
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:49,105
it felt like my <i>ki</i> was being sucked out.

122
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:55,515
He did it!

123
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:59,055
–You did it, Goku!
–He did it, he did it! Yeah!

124
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:01,925
–Attaboy, Goku!
–Not bad at all!

125
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:23,075
Look at him! Even after that kind of beating,

126
00:18:23,115 --> 00:18:24,775
he acts like nothing's happened!

127
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,275
He's an Artificial Human.

128
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,755
He probably doesn't feel pain or fatigue.

129
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:45,105
Dammit!

130
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:53,935
All right!

131
00:19:31,185 --> 00:19:33,145
He absorbed it.

132
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:36,785
I was right after all! Those guys' hands...

133
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:39,155
Son! Don't shoot any more <i>ki</i> blasts!

134
00:19:39,195 --> 00:19:41,825
These guys seem to be able to
absorb <i>ki</i> through their hands!

135
00:19:41,865 --> 00:19:44,195
Don't let them grab onto you either! Got that?

136
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,135
He can take my <i>ki</i>?

137
00:19:51,635 --> 00:19:55,545
They've got to be kidding!

138
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:08,045
Hey, there's something the matter with Goku.

139
00:20:08,085 --> 00:20:10,685
Has he already had that
much <i>ki</i> taken from him?

140
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:15,095
No, he couldn't have had any
energy taken directly from him so far.

141
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:21,025
<i>Good! That blast has allowed No. 1 9</i>
<i>to store up a great deal of power!</i>

142
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:25,065
<i>On the other hand, the amount of power</i>
<i>Goku is able to use at once is falling!</i>

143
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:28,095
<i>This is our chance! Go, No. 1 9!</i>

144
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:04,735
Don't shoot, Goku!

145
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:08,735
Father...

146
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,955
Damn...

147
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,925
Hey, he really looks like he's struggling.

148
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:26,555
He must have had his <i>ki</i> drained from him.

149
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:44,715
I knew it! Father is sick! It's his heart!

150
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:47,075
What? His heart?

151
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:49,285
You mean like that guy
from the future was saying,

152
00:21:49,325 --> 00:21:51,515
a viral infection of his heart?!

153
00:21:54,665 --> 00:21:56,125
Goku!

154
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:06,095
<i>Goku's condition is out of the ordinary.</i>

155
00:22:06,135 --> 00:22:09,505
<i>Have the symptoms of a viral heart infection...</i>

156
00:22:09,545 --> 00:22:12,075
<i>...finally begun to undermine</i>
<i>his physical condition?</i>

157
00:22:12,115 --> 00:22:16,075
<i>Will Goku indeed be able to defeat these cruel,</i>

158
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:19,515
<i>fully-powered Artificial Humans?</i>

159
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:48,675
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

160
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:54,515
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

161
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:56,885
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

162
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:05,385
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

163
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:11,895
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

164
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:16,005
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

165
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:19,505
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

166
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:22,145
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

167
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:29,615
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

168
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:33,755
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

169
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,555
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

170
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:39,595
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

171
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:45,265
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

172
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:47,435
<i>So sorry.</i>

173
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:52,575
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

174
00:23:55,315 --> 00:24:00,585
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

175
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,065
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

176
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:17,895
<i>Heh heh, nice save, Vegeta.</i>
<i>I was sure you'd show up.</i>

177
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:20,765
<i>Hmph, apparently, you</i>
<i>were watching the whole time,</i>

178
00:24:20,805 --> 00:24:23,665
<i>but you are no match for us, either!</i>

179
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:26,105
<i>Just like Goku, there!</i>

180
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:28,005
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

181
00:24:28,045 --> 00:24:31,515
<i>"The Might of Vegeta!</i>
<i>The Blood of a Super Saiyan Awakens."</i>

182
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:35,485
<i>All right, someday,</i>
<i>I'll become a Super Saiyan, too!</i>

183
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:38,285
"Next time"
"The Might of Vegeta!
The Blood of a Super Saiyan Awakens"
