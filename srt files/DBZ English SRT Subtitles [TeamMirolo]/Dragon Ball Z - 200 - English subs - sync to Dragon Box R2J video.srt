<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,980
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,610
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,910
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:54,630
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12

<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,880
<i>Several years had passed</i>
<i>since the battle against Cell.</i>

24
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,680
<i>Thanks to the actions of Son Goku and his son,</i>

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,930
<i>the Earth had been rescued from</i>
<i>falling into Cell's devilish hands,</i>

26
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,100
<i>and its people were able to take back</i>
<i>their peaceful existence once again.</i>

27
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,140
<i>However, once they become</i>
<i>accustomed to that peace,</i>

28
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,150
<i>foolish people begin to proliferate immediately.</i>

29
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:41,230
<i>That's just the way people are.</i>

30
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:30,740
<i>In the countryside where Son</i>
<i>Gohan lives, there weren't any schools,</i>

31
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,330
<i>and up to now, he had gotten</i>
<i>along at home through self-study</i>

32
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,910
<i>and correspondence courses,</i>

33
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:40,750
<i>but his mother, Chichi, was concerned</i>
<i>that that was not enough by itself,</i>

34
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,130
<i>and so it was decided that</i>
<i>he would attend high school.</i>

35
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:01,730
There's the edge of town.
I suppose it's about time I landed.

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,150
Bye-bye, Kinto Un! I'll need
you to take me home, too!

37
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,750
<i>Father, Mister Satan is believed</i>
<i>to be the hero who saved the Earth.</i>

38
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:27,130
<i>And because this is the</i>
<i>city where Mister Satan lives,</i>

39
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,010
<i>its name has even been changed to Satan City.</i>

40
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,690
<i>"7 Years Since Then!</i>
<i>Starting Today, I'm a High School Student."</i>

41
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:53,490
Come on, come on! Make with the money, quick!

42
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,490
You want to die?!

43
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,910
Don't make any trouble!

44
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,120
Get it in there, fast!

45
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,750
Hey, this looks like all there is.

46
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,170
All right, let's beat it!

47
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,130
Once we've used up the money
we've taken, we'll be back again!

48
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,300
Yahoo!

49
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,390
Huh? Maybe I dawdled too much on the way.

50
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,150
<i>All right...!</i>

51
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,510
Go on, go on! Fire!

52
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:09,690
Not again. There's just no helping this city.

53
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,400
I'll have to transform again,
so nobody can tell who I really am.

54
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Hey, hey! Come and get us!

55
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,880
What?!

56
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,550
W-Who are you?!

57
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,750
H-He's a monster!

58
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,000
G-Get out of here!

59
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,350
Y-Yow-ow-ow-ow...

60
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,110
Incredible!

61
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,700
W-What happened?

62
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,090
Say...

63
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:58,930
Who was it that did this?
Don't tell me it was the police.

64
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,600
Gee, I didn't see.

65
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,850
And after I flew all the way here...
I wonder who on Earth it was.

66
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,690
Ah, Videl-<i>sama</i>, I saw him.
It was that Golden Warrior.

67
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,530
The Golden Warrior? Again?

68
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,700
Yeah. He had incredible strength and speed.

69
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,700
He even turned over the criminal's
car from a distance as it was escaping,

70
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,700
with what looked like some kind of <i>Kiai</i> shout.

71
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,540
Oh, yeah. I think he might have been a student
at Orange Star High School, just like you.

72
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,750
He was wearing that same school badge there.

73
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,170
A-A student at my high school?

74
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,730
Is there anyone there like that?
With golden-colored hair...?

75
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,750
Say, Shapner, you're not him,
are you? The Golden Warrior?

76
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,710
Sorry to disappoint you.

77
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,170
I was doing early-morning training in my club.

78
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:17,750
I don't have the time to be
carrying on such nonsense.

79
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,180
Say, Videl, could this guy be
even stronger than your Papa?

80
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,760
Don't be ridiculous. Videl's Papa is
Mister Satan, the guy who saved the Earth.

81
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,270
Could there be anyone in
this world stronger than him?

82
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,400
Good morning, people.

83
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,900
Let me introduce to you a new student

84
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,120
who is transferring in and will
be in your class starting today.

85
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,990
You can come in.

86
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,450
G-Good day.

87
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,080
I'm Son. Son Gohan. Nice to meet you.

88
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,920
Oh, my, he's pretty cute,
isn't he? He's just my type!

89
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,130
"Gohan," he said. That's a strange name.

90
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,100
It seems like I've seen him somewhere...

91
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,060
He looks completely like a
quiet little bookworm, huh?

92
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,900
Son-<i>kun</i> here is an excellent student,

93
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,060
who got perfect scores in
math, chemistry, physics,

94
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,150
history, language, and foreign
languages on his admissions test.

95
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,240
Quiet! I would very much like for
his motivation to rub off on you, too.

96
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,910
Son-<i>kun</i>, go ahead and
sit down in an empty seat.

97
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,500
Right.

98
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,250
Let's see...

99
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,500
Over here!

100
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,500
Here, here!

101
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,130
Th-Thanks.

102
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,250
Th-Thanks.

103
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,500
I'm Eraza. Nice to meet you.

104
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,880
And while we're at it, this girl is Videl.

105
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:28,840
Okay then, today, we're starting on page 24.

106
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,850
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, you'll be surprised
to hear this! Videl's Papa, you see,

107
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,270
is Mister Satan, of all people!

108
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,810
M-Mister Satan?

109
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,820
See? You're surprised!

110
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,280
Then, you're Mister Satan's daughter?

111
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,030
That's right. You've got to be grateful to them.

112
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,700
It's because of this girl's
Papa that we're all alive now.

113
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,870
That's it! You were...

114
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,170
You were that person
I talked to this morning

115
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:01,380
at the scene where those
bank robbers were arrested.

116
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,340
Yeah.

117
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,300
Ah, the one where they say
the Golden Warrior appeared?

118
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,300
The Golden Warrior? Who is that?

119
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,310
You just got here, so you wouldn't know, huh?

120
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,980
He's a warrior for justice, who has
appeared three times in the last ten days.

121
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,310
He's supposed to be this incredibly strong boy,

122
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,900
with gold-colored hair that stands on end.

123
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,900
He's famous around this city.

124
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,980
<i>Ulp! Th-They mean me!</i>

125
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,200
<i>Those two times from when I was arranging</i>
<i>to attend this school, plus this morning...</i>

126
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,090
"I just wanted to say with
you when she said to me that..."

127
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,600
"But I wanna make her feel so
good. Nothing I can do to you..."

128
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,360
"And..."

129
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,520
You know...

130
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,690
according to an eyewitness,

131
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:10,400
the Golden Warrior was
wearing a badge from this school.

132
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,990
He was said to be wearing a whitish
shirt, with a black vest, and brown pants.

133
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,540
It may be a coincidence, but that's you to a T.

134
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,540
Oh, my, it's true!

135
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,380
No, i-it's just...

136
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,380
You there, be quiet!

137
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,300
Right, right.

138
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,930
Okay then, moving along...
"Two weeks are passed and at last..."

139
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,810
Look at who you're talking about.
Is that the body of a warrior?

140
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,480
Since long ago, the general rule is
that anyone who was good at studying

141
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,320
was hopeless when it comes to athletics.

142
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,650
And he's not even blond to begin with.

143
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,570
Yeah, you're right.

144
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,820
You look altogether weak,
if you don't mind me saying.

145
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,950
That's true, huh?

146
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,330
<i>Naturally, I don't believe it's him,</i>

147
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,960
<i>but on the video where</i>
<i>Papa was fighting Cell long ago,</i>

148
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,960
<i>there was a strange group whose</i>
<i>hair did turn golden, wasn't there?</i>

149
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,970
<i>Papa said it was just a worthless trick, though.</i>

150
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,510
Say, Gohan-<i>kun</i>, are you commuting from home?

151
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,930
Or are you renting an apartment in town?

152
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,520
Oh, I'm commuting from home.

153
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,520
Where is it? Where is your home?

154
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,360
Um, Eastern Zone 439. It's in a small village.

155
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,440
Eh?! Eastern Zone 439?! You're kidding, right?!

156
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,490
That's a thousand kilometers from here, isn't it?!

157
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,950
Geez, that's enough already!

158
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,990
Can't you keep quiet?!

159
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,870
How on earth do you get here?

160
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,540
It would take a jet flyer
five hours to travel that far!

161
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,090
W-Well, you can see how hard
it is, with all the time it takes.

162
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,920
<i>Whoops...</i>

163
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,560
"He is the greatest man..."

164
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,390
Okay, why don't we have
someone translate up to that point?

165
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,560
Let's see, who should I pick?

166
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,070
<i>Mister Satan even shows up in the textbooks!</i>

167
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,900
<i>I guess that's Satan City for you.</i>

168
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,570
Hey, you!

169
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,610
Go on and translate by way of
introducing yourself, "Mountain Boy."

170
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,450
Go on, Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

171
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,080
Right, you're the transfer student, aren't you?

172
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,380
Let's see, your name was...

173
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,130
Son Gohan, of the perfect admissions test!

174
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,550
That's right, isn't it?
Okay, Son-<i>kun</i>, try translating this.

175
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:44,470
Right. Let's see...
Er, what page are we on again?

176
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,520
We're starting on page 24.

177
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,190
Ah, right. "Mister Satan came
to live in what is now Satan City,

178
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:55,690
"and at the time was Orange Star City,

179
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,700
"following his victory at
the 24th Tenkaichi Tournament.

180
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:03,540
"Even after becoming the world
champion, he never misses his training,

181
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,750
"and his running through town every
morning has become a feature of the city."

182
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,130
Someone must be talking about me again.

183
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,760
It's tough being a hero. Am I right, you guys?

184
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,390
For today's phys ed,

185
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,980
we'll continue what we were doing
last time by having a baseball game.

186
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,940
Hey, you know what baseball is?

187
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,320
Yes. I've never played it,
but I do at least know the rules.

188
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,320
You've never played?

189
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,910
That's just great. You must have
done nothing but study, right?

190
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,490
Videl, you can have him on your team.

191
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,490
I don't want him!

192
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:49,580
Why not? His brain is first rate,

193
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,120
so maybe he can come up with some strategy.

194
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,670
That's true. All right.

195
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,510
You cover right. Do you know what "right" is?

196
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,760
Yes. It's "<i>migi</i>," isn't it?

197
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,350
<i>Migi</i>?!

198
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,350
Well, you're not wrong...

199
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,980
I wonder if Gohan is gettin' along okay.

200
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,520
This is his first time goin' to school, after all.

201
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,650
I sure hope he's gettin' accustomed to it.

202
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,160
<i>Both Mom and Bulma-san said</i>
<i>that if people knew who I really was,</i>

203
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,540
<i>there would be a big commotion,</i>
<i>and it would make a mess.</i>

204
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,130
<i>I'll have to make sure I play suitably sloppily.</i>

205
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,550
<i>It sure is hard being out in the world.</i>

206
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,920
Let 'er rip, Shapner!

207
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,590
I'm not letting you hit this, Shapner!

208
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,900
Damn!

209
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,110
He did it! A home run!

210
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,990
The runner on third has gone.

211
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,370
As I recall, if I throw it to
third in this case, they'll be out.

212
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,710
All right, gently, gently...
about this hard, maybe?

213
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,140
O-Out!

214
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,810
I did it! Three outs, change sides!

215
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,290
<i>Th-This is bad. Even at just</i>
<i>that, I must have overdone it.</i>

216
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,450
Th-That was incredible of you.

217
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,710
You just jumped about eight meters, didn't you?

218
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,290
No, it was just a fluke! A fluke!

219
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,960
O-Oh, a fluke, huh?

220
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,970
B-But still, is that
something you can call a fluke?

221
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,930
Hey, who's the next batter?

222
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,560
Number 8 leads off, right? Isn't that you?

223
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,560
Right, right! Right!

224
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,980
Sorry!

225
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,560
I wonder what will happen with his batting.

226
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,100
L-Let's watch him!

227
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,950
You bat left-handed, do you?

228
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,320
Is that wrong?

229
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,320
No, it's fine with me,

230
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,330
but, er, your grip is backwards.

231
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,490
Backwards?

232
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:36,960
Uh, just do it however you like.

233
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,340
How dare you deny me my home run earlier!

234
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,960
Maybe I ought to drop you...

235
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,130
<i>This is bad. If I draw any more</i>
<i>attention than this, it will really be bad.</i>

236
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,340
<i>I can't hit it.</i>

237
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,970
<i>Here goes! If you don't duck this, you'll die!</i>

238
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,520
Look out!

239
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,240
Y-You idiot! W-Why didn't you avoid that?!

240
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:20,670
Um, this is what's called a "dead ball," right?

241
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,840
M-Mm-hmm...

242
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,380
Lucky! Lucky! I got on
base without having to hit!

243
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm not drawing attention,
I'm not drawing attention!

244
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,930
W-What's the deal with that guy?

245
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,100
That's suspicious...

246
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,200
Hey, you! Which clubs have you decided on?

247
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,580
Er, well, I haven't decided on any.

248
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,330
In that case, join the boxing club.
You're tougher than I thought.

249
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,210
You could do pretty well.

250
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:03,540
Um, I don't plan on joining any clubs. You see...

251
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:07,010
Right, right! Gohan-<i>kun</i>'s
house is terribly far away.

252
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,880
He doesn't have time to get
involved in any club activities.

253
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,720
Th-That's right.

254
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,850
Say, Gohan-<i>kun</i>, let's go home together.
Take me as far as my house?

255
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:20,890
Um, sorry, but my car only has room for one.

256
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,900
You could move to Satan City, couldn't you?

257
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,560
Well, no, you see, about that...

258
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,700
This is suspicious, all right!

259
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,620
If his home is so far away, why
isn't he going by car or jet flyer?

260
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,800
Huh?

261
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,990
The city sure does wear you out, huh?

262
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,950
And now, there's the Golden Warrior, huh?

263
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:17,490
I'll need some kind of clothing
so that people won't know it's me.

264
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,950
I think I'll discuss it with Bulma-<i>san.</i>

265
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>The first day of high school was over.</i>

266
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,420
<i>Gohan thought that this</i>
<i>was the first time in his life</i>

267
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,840
<i>that he'd had a day that was this tiring.</i>

268
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,720
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

269
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:45,270
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

270
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,910
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

271
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,990
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

272
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:09,000
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

273
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,380
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

274
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,260
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

275
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:27,270
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

276
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,850
<i>Even now?</i>

277
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:36,530
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

278
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,870
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

279
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:48,370
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

280
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:58,420
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

281
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,240
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

282
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,490
<i>Gohan, that's a funny outfit</i>
<i>you've got on. What's going on?</i>

283
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,040
<i>Looks like he really likes</i>
<i>that transformation device</i>

284
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,830
<i>that conceals his identity.</i>

285
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,080
<i>He's transformed over</i>
<i>and over again for no reason,</i>

286
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,000
<i>and seems tickled.</i>

287
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,170
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

288
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,670
<i>"For Love and Justice –</i>
<i>Enter the Great Saiyaman."</i>

289
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,710
<i>I am he who does not abide evil!</i>

290
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,590
"Next time"
"For Love and Justice–
