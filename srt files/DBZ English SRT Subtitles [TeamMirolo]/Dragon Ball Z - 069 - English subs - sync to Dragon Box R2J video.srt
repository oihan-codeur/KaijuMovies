<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,780
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:11,790
<i>After Goku had defeated ReaCoom, and</i>
<i>then Butta, Ginyu had appeared before him.</i>

17
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,840
<i>Elsewhere, having gathered</i>
<i>all seven Dragon Balls together,</i>

18
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,840
<i>Freeza was speeding</i>
<i>toward the Grand Elder's location,</i>

19
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,550
<i>in order to learn the</i>
<i>password to have his wish granted.</i>

20
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,040
You guys use the Dragon
Radar to locate the Dragon Balls.

21
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:05,970
Vegeta, you take care of the other one.

22
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,740
Now that you've recovered
from being near death,

23
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,810
your power should be greatly increased.

24
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,210
He's no longer an unbeatable opponent.

25
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,210
You knew about that, huh?

26
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,210
We're off!

27
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,690
Good luck, Goku!

28
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,650
All right, we're up, too.

29
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,890
This is going to be a more interesting
fight than any I've ever had before...

30
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:38,440
<i>"Incredible Force!!</i>
<i>Did You See Goku's Full Power?"</i>

31
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,600
Vegeta!

32
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,810
Your guard is down!

33
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,810
He got him!

34
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,930
Yow... Damn that Vegeta...

35
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:59,600
I see now, you're a lot better than I expected.

36
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,580
And having Vegeta run off on
you like that must have hurt too.

37
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,820
<i>I have to end this quickly.</i>

38
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,950
<i>Otherwise, what little</i>
<i>hope we have will be lost.</i>

39
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,190
This is a nice development. From what I saw,

40
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,500
Kakarrot and Ginyu both have
about the same level of ability.

41
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,130
If I'm lucky, the two of them
might just take care of each other.

42
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,580
If that happens, I can't fail!

43
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:12,140
As soon as I get the password to
have my wish granted out of those runts,

44
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,510
I'll take care of them, too.

45
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,950
Then, once I make myself immortally young,

46
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,550
I'll have a chance of
beating even Freeza in battle!

47
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,570
Gohan, no matter what it takes, we have
to borrow the Dragon Radar from Bulma<i>-san,</i>

48
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,180
and find the Dragon Balls before Freeza
gets the password from Grand Elder<i>-san.</i>

49
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,850
Right!

50
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,440
You certainly have
impressive speed for a Saiyan.

51
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,880
<i>Ginyu Special Corps Commander, Ginyu...</i>

52
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,980
<i>...Super Fighting Pose!!</i>

53
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,880
Like this?

54
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,890
F-Fool! Your feet are reversed! Your feet!

55
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,490
Oh, really?

56
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:10,930
You know, you guys all
pose in the strangest ways, huh?

57
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,470
I've never seen anything like it.

58
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:21,470
W-What?! Can't you grasp the
splendor of the Ultra Fighting Pose?!

59
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,910
It doesn't matter to me
either way, I'm running out of time.

60
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,150
Sorry to interrupt your big entrance,

61
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,920
but I have to end this right now.

62
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,020
Oh, aren't you the confident one?

63
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,490
This is the first time that I,
Ginyu<i>-sama</i>, have heard such insolence.

64
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,630
If you had dared to come off to me like that

65
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:47,370
while we were sizing each other up earlier,

66
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,210
I would not have hesitated
to knock you off your perch.

67
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,210
You see, like yourself,

68
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,980
I'm the type of fighter who can
change his level of battle power at will.

69
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,450
<i>That's the Commander Ginyu</i>
<i>I know so well. He's not at all agitated.</i>

70
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,990
<i>That's no surprise, I guess.</i>

71
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,860
<i>Even if that guy's battle</i>
<i>power really is around 60,000,</i>

72
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,360
<i>then Commander Ginyu's</i>
<i>maximum fighting power is much higher.</i>

73
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,380
Yikes!

74
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,710
Geez! What could everyone else
possibly be up to while I'm here,

75
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,950
struggling by myself like this?

76
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,920
How do I know they
haven't all forgotten about me,

77
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,120
and are just goofing around now?

78
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,460
Good grief, first my spaceship gets all broken,

79
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,990
and I can't go back to Earth.

80
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,060
Then my transmitter gets all broken.

81
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,630
Nothing is going right.

82
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,740
All right, it's fixed!

83
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,970
That certainly did take
up a lot of time and effort.

84
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,960
W-What was that just now?

85
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,160
A-All seven of them are in
the same place, aren't they?

86
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,000
I-I'll just bet they were
going to leave me behind,

87
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,630
while they went and made
their wish to Shen Long! All right!

88
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,130
<i>But suppose the person who has</i>
<i>gathered the Dragon Balls is Vegeta, instead?</i>

89
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,130
Not again!

90
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:06,160
W-What is it with this planet anyway?

91
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,870
I know! Even if it is Vegeta, I can just say,

92
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,170
"Send me back to Earth" first!

93
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,580
Hey, that's simple enough, isn't it?

94
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,050
With that settled, I'm off to the Dragon Balls!

95
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,210
Let's go!

96
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,290
<i>All right...</i>

97
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:49,320
He's fast! He might have the edge on speed!

98
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,740
Oh, crap!

99
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,180
I managed to bottle you up there pretty good!

100
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,360
Dammit!

101
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,530
Commander! He's all ours now!

102
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,510
Damn... he's got incredible
power! I can't get free!

103
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,950
Commander! You can shatter his
bones any time now, and finish him off!

104
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,990
<i>I-I'm out of options! At this</i>
<i>point, I'll have to use Kaio-ken...</i>

105
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,230
Wha–?

106
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,990
C-Commander!

107
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,740
Who asked you to help, Jheese?

108
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,280
C-Commander!

109
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,490
If you pull anything uncalled-for
like that again, consider yourself dead!

110
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,190
Yes, sir.

111
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,990
And as for you!

112
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,340
You're still hiding your
true power level, even now!

113
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,780
Did you really think I wouldn't be able to tell?

114
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:48,810
Perhaps you were planning on saving
that energy for a battle with Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

115
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,350
Don't you dare take me so lightly!

116
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,420
I'm itching for a good fight, the
kind I don't get to enjoy every day,

117
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,420
so cut out your silly charade!

118
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,260
Okay, you got it. I'll show you my true power.

119
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,330
Very good. I doubt you'll
be able to rest in peace

120
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,870
if you're killed without
using all of your power.

121
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,470
Use that device of yours that
reads your opponent's power,

122
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,880
and take a good look at my rating!

123
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,450
I won't even need to look at my Scouter.

124
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,090
Your rating should only rise to around 85,000.

125
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,200
<i>Kaio-ken!</i>

126
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,150
90,000!

127
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,410
95,000!

128
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:13,420
100,000... 105,000...
106,000... 107,000...

129
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,160
108,000!

130
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,030
I-Impossible!

131
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,830
109,000...

132
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:35,940
110,000!

133
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,250
110,000! It can't be!

134
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,160
I-It's still going up!

135
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,360
<i>Incredible, Goku!</i>

136
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:03,310
<i>His power continues to rise,</i>
<i>not knowing where to stop...</i>

137
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,480
<i>Just what is Goku's true power?</i>

138
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,580
<i>Exactly how much is it?</i>

139
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:18,860
<i>And what is Ginyu's true power?</i>

140
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:48,020
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

141
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:53,860
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

142
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,230
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

143
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,730
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

144
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,240
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

145
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,350
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

146
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,850
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

147
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,480
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

148
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,000
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

149
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,100
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

150
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,900
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

151
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,940
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

152
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,610
