Or will it be Contestant No. 18?!

36

After seeing her astounding manner of fighting,

there are suddenly many
cheers for Contestant No. 18!

Well, come at me any way you want!

00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:11,255
Isn't that nice for your mommy?

44
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:15,425
10 million Zeni, he said!

She'll take it, she'll take it!

laughing, Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>!

Hmm, you're right. Where on
earth could they have gone to?

Shut up! Stop blubbering!
Be quiet, or I really will kill you!

Oh! Contestant No. 18 has
connected with a headlock!

Listen, speak softly. Do you want to win?

55
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:51,275
N-No, enough! I've had enough,
please don't do anything terrible...

56
00:06:51,315 --> 00:06:55,195
What's wrong, Satan! Get her!

57
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:59,445
If so, I don't mind letting you win...

58
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:04,035
That's ticklish... Hmm?
W-What did you just...?

59
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:07,785
I said I was going to let you win!

60
00:07:07,825 --> 00:07:11,295
In exchange, you will hand
over to me 20 million Zeni.

61
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:14,965
I will lose to you. Not a bad deal, right?

62
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:18,425
That's all it will cost you to keep your fame.

63
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:22,385
What can this be? Mister
Satan is not moving at all!

64
00:07:22,425 --> 00:07:26,805
Can it be that even Mister Satan
is not up to this opponent?

65
00:07:26,845 --> 00:07:29,765
2-20 million Zeni?

66
00:07:29,805 --> 00:07:33,145
When you win, you'll get
10 million Zeni in prize money.

67
00:07:33,185 --> 00:07:36,275
You just have to shoulder
the other 10 million Zeni.

68
00:07:36,315 --> 00:07:39,405
–Cheap, don't you think?
–B-But...

69
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:43,155
Hey, I don't care. I could
just knock you out right here

70
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:46,575
and make due with 10 million Zeni...

71
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,115
Kn-Knockout...?

72
00:07:56,465 --> 00:07:59,795
You jerk! Worthless idiot!

73
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:01,595
You damned fool, Satan!

74
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:03,965
Don't ever come back!

75
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,675
Die, Satan!

76
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:12,015
Hmph, I hate you, Papa!

77
00:08:28,155 --> 00:08:29,705
How about it?

78
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:34,335
I-I'll pay it! O-Of course I will let you have it!!

79
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,875
Well then, that's settled.
Pleasure doing business.

80
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:45,845
Oh! Mister Satan has flicked
Contestant No. 18 off of him!

81
00:08:51,515 --> 00:08:53,015
D-Damn!

82
00:08:54,895 --> 00:08:56,975
Hurry and come at me!

83
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:13,835
I have now seen through all your tricks!

84
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:17,875
I hate to say it, but you are no match for me!

85
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:22,005
–Oh, really?
–Incredible, Mister Satan!

86
00:09:22,045 --> 00:09:25,175
I will admit that you have considerable skill.

87
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:28,175
However, your opponent is too much for you!

88
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:32,015
You've fought well, but
after all, I am the champion!

89
00:09:32,055 --> 00:09:34,185
Wow, cool!

90
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:36,605
Fine, just go already, moron!

91
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,565
Ah, r-right...

92
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:49,035
Oh, now comes Mister Satan's counterattack!

93
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:51,115
Incredible! Incredible! A storm of punches!

94
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:53,575
Contestant No. 18 is being pummeled!

95
00:10:01,255 --> 00:10:03,715
D-Didn't we have an agreement?

96
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:07,215
I just said I'd let you win,
I didn't say I wouldn't hit back.

97
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:09,725
If only I get beaten up, it
would look suspicious, right?

98
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:12,805
B-But that's all I can take...

99
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,145
All right! Then grab hold and throw me!

100
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:19,475
Then use your finishing
technique for the big finish.

101
00:10:19,515 --> 00:10:21,605
–Got that?
–Y-Yes!

102
00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:27,945
Oh! Mister Satan has thrown Contestant No. 18!

103
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:34,825
Here goes! This will put an end to it all!

104
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:36,455
Go, Satan!

105
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,835
Take this!

106
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:46,635
Satan Miracle Special
Ultra Super Megaton Punch!!

107
00:10:49,675 --> 00:10:52,635
S-She took that head-on!

108
00:11:10,155 --> 00:11:13,535
Um...

109
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:16,375
This is your finishing technique?

110
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:19,995
Y-Yes. For the time being...

111
00:11:51,775 --> 00:11:53,325
Did you see that?!

112
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:56,825
Uh, at first glance, it may have
looked like an ordinary blow,

113
00:11:56,865 --> 00:12:00,915
but after a few seconds, it
strikes with an explosive shock!

114
00:12:00,955 --> 00:12:09,925
That was the Satan Miracle...
um... Beautiful Super Bari-bari Punch!

115
00:12:18,055 --> 00:12:20,395
Mister Satan is victorious!

116
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:33,535
Number One!

117
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:35,945
Whoa! You really are awesome, Mister Satan!

118
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:38,955
He's every bit our protector of the Earth!

119
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:42,875
Contestant No. 18 showed
us marvelous strength indeed,

120
00:12:42,915 --> 00:12:46,415
but before Mister Satan,
she was all-too-easily defeated.

121
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:49,925
Mister Satan defends his championship!

122
00:12:49,965 --> 00:12:52,095
What the hell is happenin'?

123
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:54,005
G-Good question...

124
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:02,725
I'll come to your house
tomorrow to get the money.

125
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:05,395
If you don't pay me, I'll kill you!

126
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:09,355
Y-Yes, I understand.

127
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:17,235
Satan! Satan! Satan!

128
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:43,475
Damn...

129
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:46,185
I wonder what gave us away.

130
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,025
No. 18-<i>san</i> is certain to win now.

131
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:52,855
Nothing is ever certain... Hmm?

132
00:13:55,985 --> 00:13:57,695
Isn't that...?

133
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:05,705
Ah, it's Videl-<i>san</i>!

134
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:06,705
Hey!

135
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,995
Videl-<i>san</i>!

136
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:12,545
Videl-<i>san</i>!

137
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:15,835
Goten-<i>kun</i>!

138
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:18,255
Ah, wait up, Goten!

139
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:35,905
They're late.

140
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:37,695
They're too late!

141
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:42,035
I wonder what kind of guy is coming out.

142
00:14:45,955 --> 00:14:49,535
I wish they'd come soon.
What could they be doing?

143
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,675
I'm looking forward to seeing
how strong you've become.

144
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:59,345
Gohan, have you been training
regularly while I've been gone?

145
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:03,685
Ah, no, you see...

146
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,845
Hmph! Unfortunately,

147
00:15:05,885 --> 00:15:09,605
it seems he's used peacetime as an
excuse not to do all that much training.

148
00:15:09,645 --> 00:15:14,025
Nowadays, we're the
ones with the higher powers.

149
00:15:14,065 --> 00:15:16,945
Of course, in his case, we
never know what might happen

150
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:19,985
if he launches into a rage, do we?

151
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:30,625
<i>No wonder these three are so composed!</i>

152
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:32,955
<i>If it comes to it, they can</i>
<i>release incredible power,</i>

153
00:15:32,995 --> 00:15:37,215
<i>like Goku-san momentarily displayed before.</i>

154
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:41,095
<i>Th-The truth is so utterly hard to believe...</i>

155
00:15:41,135 --> 00:15:45,925
<i>To think, that the Kaioshin could be</i>
<i>flustered by people from the lower realm...</i>

156
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:57,945
I-It can't be...!

157
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:04,785
D-Dabura!!

158
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:15,795
<i>I-It can't be! I wasn't expecting</i>
<i>them to send out Dabura so soon!</i>

159
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:21,095
It's really quite something for you humans

160
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:23,595
to have beaten Yakon and come to Stage 3.

161
00:16:23,635 --> 00:16:27,975
You might even call it miraculous.
I will give you credit for that.

162
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:34,225
However, this is as far as it goes.
I will be your opponent now.

163
00:16:36,565 --> 00:16:41,865
Hmph! For you, his number one,
to be making an appearance already,

164
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:46,115
it must mean that Babidi is
getting considerably anxious.

165
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:52,875
Enough of your idle chit-chat!
Let's go, right now, all of you!

166
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:55,455
No way, no way!

167
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:58,465
It's my turn to be the one that beats you!

168
00:16:58,505 --> 00:17:00,465
What did you say?!

169
00:17:00,505 --> 00:17:03,175
Never mind that, let's
fight in a different location,

170
00:17:03,215 --> 00:17:07,475
like when Father and Vegeta did,
not this cramped place!

171
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:10,685
Oh, but that dark place would be a problem.

172
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:15,855
W-Why you...!

173
00:17:15,895 --> 00:17:18,145
That's enough mocking out of you!

174
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:21,065
Just a minute, Dabura!

175
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:27,155
Any shock received by the
spaceship will not be good

176
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:30,415
towards completely reviving Majin Boo.

177
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:34,835
If you can, why don't you
fight in a different place?

178
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,165
Ah, certainly.

179
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:38,835
Where would be good?

180
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,175
Wherever allows them the best handicap.

181
00:17:41,215 --> 00:17:44,085
A world with an environment similar to Earth's.

182
00:17:46,385 --> 00:17:48,385
You're sure self-possessed. Little wonder.

183
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:51,845
Nobody can stand up to you, after all.

184
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,225
Well, here goes.

185
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:56,225
Papparapa!

186
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:06,945
W-What's this?

187
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:24,295
How's this? You should
have no quarrel with this place.

188
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:26,755
Okay! Well, here goes!

189
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:29,805
Don't get careless, Gohan!

190
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,835
That's about it. And that's
why everyone's gone there.

191
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:13,135
Madoshi...?!

192
00:19:15,135 --> 00:19:16,645
Majin...?!

193
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:19,105
Y-Yeah...

194
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,645
D-Did you hear that, Goten?

195
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:23,895
Y-Yeah!

196
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:38,875
Sounds like fun! Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

197
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,205
That way, right?

198
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:44,215
That's right, that's right! I can feel our Papas' <i>ki</i>!

199
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,045
J-Just a second, you guys! Don't
tell me you're thinking of going there?

200
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:49,965
Hurry! If we don't get there fast,

201
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:52,005
our Papas will have already beaten their foes!

202
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:57,475
No, no! I wanna see, I wanna see!
I want to see this Majin Boo guy!

203
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:58,935
Go!!

204
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:07,895
Yahoo!

205
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:17,535
You've got to be kidding!

206
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:07,415
You fool!

207
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,365
What?

208
00:22:19,235 --> 00:22:26,165
<i>Gohan's power is at full throttle!</i>
<i>The real fight begins now!</i>

209
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:39,055
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

210
00:22:40,805 --> 00:22:45,645
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

211
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:56,195
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

212
00:22:56,235 --> 00:23:02,285
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

213
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:09,295
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

214
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:14,665
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

215
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:18,545
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

216
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:27,645
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

217
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:29,145
<i>Even now?</i>

218
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:36,815
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

219
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:42,195
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

220
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:48,665
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

221
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:58,715
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

222
00:24:13,855 --> 00:24:16,105
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

223
00:24:16,145 --> 00:24:19,615
<i>Dabura pulled out.</i>
<i>I don't think he's running away.</i>

224
00:24:19,655 --> 00:24:21,115
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

225
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:23,615
<i>Babidi-sama, there is one among them</i>

226
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:25,655
<i>with strong enough wickedness in his heart,</i>

227
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:28,325
<i>that we can draw him over to our side.</i>

228
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:30,375
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

229
00:24:30,415 --> 00:24:33,495
<i>"A Wicked Heart Discovered!!</i>
<i>Dabura's Great Idea."</i>

230
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:35,585
<i>They're going after Vegeta-san!</i>

231
00:24:36,335 --> 00:24:39,835
"Next time"
"A Wicked Heart Discovered!!
Dabura's Great Idea"
