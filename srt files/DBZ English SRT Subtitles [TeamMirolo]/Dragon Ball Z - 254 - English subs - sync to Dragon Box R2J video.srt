<i>of the Earth's people and cities. However...</i>

26
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:13,975
W-Why is it you kill people
and destroy buildings and such?

27
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:15,775
Because it's fun!

28
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:20,115
I-It won't do to have you
killing and destroying and so on!

29
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:25,615
N-No, that's fine! That's all
fine, if you find it to be fun!

30
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:29,165
You think it's wrong for me to do?

31
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,165
Y-Yeah, well...

32
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:34,165
Okay, I'll stop!

33
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:37,175
Y-You're not going to kill anyone any more?

34
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:38,175
Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:39,755
Y-You're not going to
destroy anywhere else?

36
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,175
Mm-hmm.

37
00:02:41,215 --> 00:02:43,305
<i>I did it!</i>

38
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:48,975
<i>Just as a subtle change was starting</i>
<i>to take place within Boo's heart...</i>

42
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,235
That's one down!

43
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:44,905
W-What are those imbeciles doing?!

44
00:03:46,865 --> 00:03:50,655
We didn't need this!

45
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:53,705
Oh?

46
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:55,705
Y-Young master!

47
00:03:55,745 --> 00:04:00,795
That guy over there together with
Majin Boo, isn't that Mister Satan?

48
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:05,345
Why would the hero Mister Satan
be together with Majin Boo?

49
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:07,805
Hmph! Is that any concern of mine?

50
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:10,225
I'll just blow them both away at once!

51
00:04:10,265 --> 00:04:14,265
We will become new
heroes, in place of Satan!

52
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:22,275
Burn in hell!

53
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:48,635
Take that! I blew them to pieces!

54
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:50,725
You sure did it, young master!

55
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:55,845
This is the birth of a new hero,
who saved the Earth from Majin Boo!

56
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:23,875
H-Hey! H-He's still standing!
He's not blown to bits!

57
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:52,155
He moved! He's still alive!

58
00:05:52,195 --> 00:05:53,745
D-Damn that guy!

59
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:04,625
W-Why you...!

60
00:06:07,255 --> 00:06:09,335
You're gonna pay!!

61
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:13,805
You're gonna pay for this!!

62
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:17,645
W-What?!

63
00:06:17,685 --> 00:06:23,235
You stupid piece-of-crap jackass!!

64
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:27,695
You're gonna...!
You're gonna...! You're gonna...!

65
00:06:30,865 --> 00:06:32,945
Get the hell out of here!

66
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,805
Scum of the earth!

67
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:17,745
Dammit, what a cruel thing to do...

68
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:26,915
M-Majin Boo-<i>san</i>! He's still barely alive!

69
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:31,295
Quickly! Quickly!

70
00:07:34,675 --> 00:07:37,225
How about it? Can you heal him?

71
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:39,555
If he's not dead, I can heal him.

72
00:07:57,615 --> 00:08:02,245
We did it! We did it! We did it!

73
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:05,835
We did it, we did it, we did it!

74
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:10,795
We did it, we did it, we did it,
we did it, we did it, we did it!

75
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:14,425
We did it, we did it, we did it, we did it!

76
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:29,565
W-What's going on here? Why are
that blowhard and Majin Boo together?

77
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:36,235
I-It could be that we can get
through this without fighting!

78
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:41,705
But still...

79
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,875
The fact that he's in danger has not changed.

80
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,585
Great!

81
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,755
Bravo, bravo!

82
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:02,805
All finished!

83
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,105
How splendid!

84
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:14,645
I was sure to make a room for you, too.

85
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:20,905
Thank you so much!

86
00:09:22,075 --> 00:09:24,325
And now, come see this.

87
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:29,535
This is your home.

88
00:09:31,835 --> 00:09:34,755
How nice for you, huh?!

89
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:48,395
Okay, now, spread those legs!

90
00:09:48,435 --> 00:09:55,355
One-two! One-two! One-two! One-two!

91
00:09:55,395 --> 00:10:01,155
Right, one more time! One-two! One-two!

92
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:06,745
One-two! There now!
See you again next week!

93
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:11,165
<i>I wonder if the Earth is okay</i>
<i>while we're here doing this...</i>

94
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:17,255
You were just thinking if everything
is okay while we're doing this, right?

95
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,845
I told you at the beginning,

96
00:10:21,885 --> 00:10:24,135
the power-up requires 20 hours.
Just relax and sit there.

97
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:28,555
Have you forgotten that there is
no reason why a Kaioshin would lie?

98
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:31,145
–No!
–In that case, fine.

99
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:34,565
Right.

100
00:10:34,605 --> 00:10:37,155
Now then...

101
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:39,735
Is this Bulma or whoever girl a fine woman?

102
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:43,405
Your father made me a promise, you know.

103
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:47,575
Once I draw your power
out beyond your bounds,

104
00:10:47,615 --> 00:10:49,625
this Bulma or whoever middle-aged woman

105
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:52,455
would let me touch her
on the boobs and behind.

106
00:10:52,495 --> 00:10:57,335
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, shouldn't
you be concentrating harder?

107
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,545
I'm no amateur at this!

108
00:10:59,585 --> 00:11:04,845
If I couldn't concentrate while doing
this little, I couldn't be a Kaioshin!

109
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:11,725
Well, how about it?

110
00:11:11,765 --> 00:11:14,565
Sure, she's a downright beauty.

111
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:21,565
Th-That so? This is no time for
us to be carrying on idly, is it?

112
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:26,825
A downright beauty...
I have to hurry and power you up!

113
00:11:30,205 --> 00:11:33,705
Just as you'd expect from our honorable
forefather. He's found his concentration.

114
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:36,415
Really?

115
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:39,165
With him in that manner,
everything is all right.

116
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:46,555
Yo! Is the yummy stuff done yet?

117
00:11:46,595 --> 00:11:50,725
I'm finishing now, please
wait just a moment longer.

118
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:52,515
Yo-o!

119
00:11:55,185 --> 00:12:01,815
Boo has the innocent nature of a little
child, huh? He won't be killing anyone now!

120
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:05,655
Thank goodness,
thank goodness, thank goodness!

121
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:08,655
Yo! Ready yet?

122
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,955
Yes, right now!

123
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:17,835
Sorry to keep you waiting.

124
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:22,215
It's absolutely delicious!

125
00:12:22,255 --> 00:12:24,465
You'll eat with me too?

126
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,255
Y-Yes!

127
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:46,825
Where have you been off playing?!

128
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:50,575
We weren't off playing, we
went to Majin Boo's place.

129
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:54,575
I'm telling you that once your Fusion comes
undone, you are to return here immediately!

130
00:12:54,615 --> 00:12:56,585
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, did you watch us?

131
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,045
I didn't have to watch you.

132
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:03,215
Everyone here at least knows that
after thirty minutes, you return to normal!

133
00:13:03,255 --> 00:13:06,755
We don't have time right now for
you to be doing anything uncalled-for!

134
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:08,805
Do not do anything else on your own!

135
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,645
Shall I wash your back?

136
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:28,235
You get in with us!

137
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:32,245
It's all right for me to get in with you?

138
00:13:32,285 --> 00:13:34,665
Don't be so restrained. Get in!

139
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:38,995
Right! Very well then,
if you'll pardon the intrusion...

140
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,795
S-S-Sorry about that!

141
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:48,805
Fun, huh?

142
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:52,265
Y-Yes, and the water is
just the right temperature.

143
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:57,435
Fun! Fun!

144
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:18,245
Fun, huh?

145
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:19,325
Y-Yes!

146
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:33,675
That bath was just right!

147
00:14:57,205 --> 00:15:02,995
Er, if it is all right with you, could you
let me take a picture together with you?

148
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,255
Please, as a memento.

149
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:10,795
That's it! A little more like...
please, sprawl yourself out.

150
00:15:10,835 --> 00:15:12,215
Like this?

151
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:16,675
Pardon me, but taking
pictures like this is in fashion!

152
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:29,985
<i>I guess I took advantage of Boo's innocent</i>
<i>heart and wasn't very scrupulous about this.</i>

153
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,735
I don't need this!

154
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,835
I've gotten hungry!
Cook something yummy for me!

155
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,585
<i>He just ate a little while ago.</i>

156
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:54,135
Okay, okay! I'll cook something right away!

157
00:15:54,175 --> 00:16:01,845
Something yummy! Something yummy!
Something yummy! Something yummy!

158
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:10,655
For dessert, the chocolate you brought
will be fine! They're yummy, after all!

159
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:12,735
Right!

160
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:16,115
You miserable traitor!

161
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:20,245
You pose as a champion of justice,
and then go and become Boo's underling?!

162
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:23,245
W-Why you...!

163
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:25,955
Yo! Isn't it ready yet?

164
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:40,425
Miserable traitor!

165
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:42,635
Die!!

166
00:17:03,705 --> 00:17:04,745
Serves you right!

167
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,045
Satan...!

168
00:17:21,675 --> 00:17:24,845
Boo! Don't think this is over yet!

169
00:17:27,265 --> 00:17:29,515
Still alive...

170
00:18:06,265 --> 00:18:12,975
U-Unbelievable! Y-You saved me!
Thank you, Boo-<i>sama</i>!

171
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,865
B-Boo-<i>sama</i>?

172
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,245
Boo-<i>sama</i>! Is something the matter?

173
00:18:28,285 --> 00:18:34,665
Run... away... with the dog... far... away...!

174
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:37,675
Y-You'll die!

175
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:41,135
Die? What do you mean?

176
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:45,225
Hurry up!!

177
00:18:45,265 --> 00:18:46,595
R-Right!

178
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:54,145
Farther awa-ay!

179
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:55,645
Right!

180
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:49,035
What is it?!

181
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:03,795
W-What's this?

182
00:20:31,785 --> 00:20:35,495
T-This isn't any trick...!

183
00:20:37,795 --> 00:20:40,835
<i>As a result of Majin Boo's intense anger,</i>

184
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:49,055
<i>the evil portion inside him has swelled</i>
<i>up and sprung out as another Majin Boo!</i>

185
00:20:49,095 --> 00:20:53,895
<i>That is to say, he has divided</i>
<i>into a purely evil Majin Boo,</i>

186
00:20:53,935 --> 00:20:56,805
<i>and a naive Majin Boo.</i>

187
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,715
Why you...!

188
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:52,365
P-Piccolo-<i>san</i>, w-what's happening?

189
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:30,905
<i>Two Majin Boos. The Earth</i>
<i>may never return to normal now!</i>

190
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:39,035
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

191
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:45,585
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

192
00:22:49,835 --> 00:22:56,185
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

193
00:22:56,225 --> 00:23:02,265
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

194
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:09,275
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

195
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:14,655
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

196
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:18,535
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

197
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:27,585
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

198
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,135
<i>Even now?</i>

199
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:36,765
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

200
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:42,185
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

201
00:23:42,225 --> 00:23:48,645
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

202
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:58,695
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

203
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:15,675
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

204
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:17,885
<i>A battle between the two Boos has begun.</i>

205
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:19,765
<i>The way things are going ain't good.</i>

206
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:21,685
<i>There's no way the first Boo can win.</i>

207
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:23,475
<i>The other one took most of his strength!</i>

208
00:24:23,515 --> 00:24:27,935
<i>How can this be? That new Boo is a mass of evil!</i>

209
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:30,145
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

210
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:33,565
<i>"Which One Will Win!?</i>
<i>A Good-and-Evil Boo-Boo Confrontation."</i>

211
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,325
<i>Ah! The first Boo got turned into chocolate!</i>

212
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:39,785
"Next time"
"Which One Will Win!?
A Good-and-Evil Boo-Boo Confrontation"
