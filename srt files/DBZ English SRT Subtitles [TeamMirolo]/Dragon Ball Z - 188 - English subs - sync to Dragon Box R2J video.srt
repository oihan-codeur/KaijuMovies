There's no way my perfect form

–Wait!

What's this?! Under the
<i>bento</i> salesboy's ferocious attack,

35
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,610
Cell's condition has started to change!

36
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:27,740
This was unexpected!

37
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,030
Will the <i>bento</i> salesboy end up
being the victor of these Cell Games?!

38
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,620
Th-The sound from the mike is broken, too.

39
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,410
Th-That's right...

40
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,040
Your courageous announcer's
voice rings out to no avail.

41
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,140
What's this? What's happening?

42
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,160
C-Cell's body has changed back!

43
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
He's no longer in his perfect form!

44
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,290
Gohan has won.

45
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,590
Cell is no longer any match for Gohan.

46
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,480
Dammit!

47
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,040
Dammit!

48
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,600
That's it, Gohan!

49
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,600
Now! Attack him once and for all!

50
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,510
What's the matter?! Get up here!

51
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,260
Damn you!

52
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:30,040
Tch! This is getting dull. You're through, now.

53
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,720
Gohan! Don't play around!
Hurry up and defeat Cell!

54
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,950
Y-You won't get away with this!
I won't let you get away with this!

55
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,350
W-What could be happening?

56
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,890
Cell is rapidly changing his shape!

57
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,350
Th-This time, he's swelling up like a balloon!

58
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,200
What is this? What is he planning to do?

59
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,580
This is bad!

60
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,750
You guys are finished now!

61
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,220
I-I'm going to blow myself up momentarily.

62
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:05,600
I may die, but all the rest of you will die, too!

63
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Th-The whole Earth will be caught in the blast!

64
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,520
–What?!
–Wha– He's going to blow himself up?!

65
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,480
S-Sure enough, given his power, the
whole Earth probably would be blown away!

66
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,420
I won't let you do that!

67
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,590
Whoa! You'd better not attack me.

68
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,430
If you apply any shock to me now,
I will explode at that instant!

69
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,180
It would just mean your deaths
will come a little sooner.

70
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,520
O-One more minute! Not even I can stop it now!

71
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,950
This can't be...!

72
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,370
What do we do?

73
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,950
Unless we do something...

74
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,620
I-It's no use!

75
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,120
There's nothing we can do now!

76
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,920
45 more seconds!

77
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,560
Gohan! You're the only one who
can finish Cell off! Do it quickly!

78
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,190
Don't push him any more!
There's no telling what he'll do!

79
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:50,450
H-How could things have turned
out like this? Father was right...

80
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,460
Damn...

81
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,510
It's my fault.

82
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,510
If only I had finished him off earlier...!

83
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,890
A-Another 30 seconds...!

84
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,450
Th-The Earth will be lost! Damn it all!

85
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,440
W-What is it, Goku?

86
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,030
Sure enough, no matter how I think it through,

87
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:08,490
I can't come up with any
other way to save the Earth...

88
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,490
What do you mean, Goku?

89
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,120
Goku-<i>san</i>...!

90
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,790
Bye-bye, everyone.

91
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,840
–What?!
–Goku! Don't tell me you're...!

92
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:27,340
Ten more seconds!

93
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:31,380
Looks like this fight ended in a draw, huh?

94
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,390
Damn...

95
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,400
Goku!!

96
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,810
You did fine up to this point, Gohan.

97
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,600
F-Father...?

98
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,440
Tell your mom that I'm sorry.

99
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,860
I always selfishly did whatever I wanted.

100
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,660
Goodbye, Gohan.

101
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,410
Goku!

102
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,300
Father!!

103
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,550
Goku!!

104
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:54,390
Y-Y-You idiot!

105
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,220
Don't you bring that thing here!

106
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,140
Sorry about this, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!
This was the only place!

107
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,900
How can you say that...?!

108
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,610
Damn!

109
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,200
I-It's gone... Goku's <i>ki...</i>

110
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,210
Goku!

111
00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:00,300
Father!!

112
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,730
What's wrong?

113
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,320
I can't sense Goku's <i>ki</i>. Cell's <i>ki</i> either.

114
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,070
You're not telling me Son-<i>kun</i> is dead, are you?

115
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,310
W-What in the world just happened?

116
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,480
C-Cell is not here.

117
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,150
Cell and that young man
just suddenly disappeared.

118
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,820
I'm talking again...

119
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,490
M-Mister Satan, what exactly...?

120
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:21,630
It's over, Gohan. You and Goku put an end to it.

121
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,810
I-It's my fault...!

122
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:33,150
If only I'd killed Cell at that
time, like Father told me to...!

123
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,110
But I got too carried away...

124
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,240
Gohan, don't blame yourself too much.

125
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,240
Without your power, the
Earth could not have been saved.

126
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,740
Isn't that so?

127
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,080
Goku died with a contented look on his face.

128
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,090
I'm sure he was happy
about how much you've grown.

129
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,420
Come on, get up.

130
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,930
Let's go home.

131
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,400
No. 18!

132
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,170
Father...

133
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,410
Sorry, Bubbles and Gregory, for getting
you guys caught in the middle of this.

134
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
I absolutely cannot believe what you did.

135
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,040
I am Kaio! I'm the most
important person in this world!

136
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,130
I'm higher than even Kami-<i>sama</i>!

137
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:28,390
And yet... and yet... for the sake of Earth,

138
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,720
a single planet, you used me like this!

139
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,600
I've apologized over and over again, ain't I?

140
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,730
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you sure are on my back, huh?

141
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:38,850
There wasn't any other way that I could think of!

142
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,070
Goku! Mind your language!

143
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,740
How dare you say I'm on your back!

144
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,490
Right...!

145
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,240
But you know something, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

146
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,660
Cell's spirit ain't around, huh?

147
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,660
Could he have gone
straight to Hell or something?

148
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,790
N-Now that you mention it...

149
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,210
Ah! He's gone! He's nowhere!

150
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:09,340
N-No matter who they are,
whenever anyone dies,

151
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,090
they go to Yama's place first.

152
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,140
What does this mean?

153
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,650
Cell hasn't died yet. He's still alive!

154
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,230
W-What?!

155
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,280
Kuririn! What are you planning
to do with that Artificial Human?

156
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,240
If she's still alive, hurry and kill her!

157
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,660
Y-You can't mean that. She's–No. 18
here wasn't all that bad a person.

158
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:44,590
Hmph! I wouldn't be too sure.
You guys are as naive as ever!

159
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,890
What?!

160
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,670
Th-That–That <i>ki</i>...!

161
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:26,090
I-It couldn't be...!

162
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,170
I-It can't be...!

163
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,040
Who was it that I hit? Trunks, was it?

164
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,650
<i>What's this? Cell did not die.</i>

165
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,440
<i>This time, Earth is in a great pinch for sure!</i>

166
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,420
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

167
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,260
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

168
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,630
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

169
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:05,140
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

170
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,650
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

171
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,740
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

172
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,240
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

173
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,870
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

174
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,420
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

175
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,510
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

176
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,300
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

177
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,350
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

178
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,020
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

179
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,190
<i>So sorry.</i>

180
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,310
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,320
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:14,260
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

183
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,880
<i>What do you mean, Cell is still alive?</i>

184
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,800
<i>I was sure he'd blown himself up!</i>

185
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,140
<i>I've returned from the brink of death,</i>

186
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:26,850
<i>and I've greatly powered up.</i>
<i>All thanks to Son Goku.</i>

187
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,850
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

188
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,440
<i>"A Nightmare in Broad Daylight!!</i>
<i>The Terror Becomes Even More Perfect."</i>

189
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,030
<i>This time, I have to make</i>
<i>sure I avenge Father for good!</i>

190
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:37,940
"Next time"
"A Nightmare in Broad Daylight!!
The Terror Becomes Even More Perfect"
