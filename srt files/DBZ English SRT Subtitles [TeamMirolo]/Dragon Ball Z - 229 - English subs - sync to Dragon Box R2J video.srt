What kind of guy do you suppose
this Majin is? I wonder if he's strong.

You mustn't, Goku-<i>san</i>!

78
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,560
If you were to fight here, you
would play right into Babidi's hands!

79
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,570
Your energy would be absorbed, and
Majin Boo will most assuredly be revived!

80
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,400
Vegeta, you let yourself fall under Babidi's spell

81
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,870
and lost your self-control, and did all this,

82
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,490
all in order to get me serious.

83
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,750
Am I wrong?

84
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,420
What's that?

85
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,420
If I hadn't done all this,
you wouldn't have fought me!

86
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:24,220
In only one day, you'll
disappear from this world.

87
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,430
And yet all this gets in the way!

88
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:33,730
S-So for that... just for that,
you've done this foolish thing?

89
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,610
Foolish thing?!

90
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,440
Foolish thing, you say?!!

91
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,910
This is everything to me!
It does not matter to me

92
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:56,580
what happens with Majin Boo or anything else!

93
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,420
He... he surpassed my strength!

94
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,430
He is a Saiyan, same as me, yet he outpaced me!

95
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:11,680
Me! The prince, at the height
of his overwhelming power!

96
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:18,440
I-I've even had my life saved by him!

97
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,690
I cannot forgive him for that! Absolutely not!!

98
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,710
Babidi! Change us to a place
where no one else is around!

99
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,720
I have decided to fight Vegeta!

100
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,650
Look, we did it! We did it!

101
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,730
Just a moment!

102
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,650
If you're going to confront him no matter what,

103
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,660
then do it after you have defeated me!

104
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,950
F-Father...!

105
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Understood.

106
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,010
Do as you like.

107
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,640
I'm sorry, Kaioshin-<i>sama.</i>

108
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,360
They've started fighting amongst themselves!

109
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,370
Take that, lousy Kaioshin!

110
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,330
The return of Majin Boo
is now just a matter of time.

111
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,460
As you wish, I will change your location!

112
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,250
Papparapa!

113
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,380
Huh? They vanished!

114
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,050
Where on earth do you suppose
they've disappeared to, Mister Satan?

115
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,560
Damn! And I was just about ready
to beat some punishment into them!

116
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,870
You shouldn't have any
complaints about this place.

117
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,870
Nope.

118
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,040
You can't, Father!

119
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,710
It is all right.

120
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,380
Having come to this, there is nothing we can do.

121
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,720
You two feel free to fight.

122
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,680
Son Gohan-<i>san</i> and I will
break through this entrance

123
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,600
and go fight with Babidi and Dabura.

124
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,520
We cannot help that applying such a shock

125
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,770
might mean Majin Boo could emerge.

126
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,690
In this event, it is better than having
your damage energy taken from you

127
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:18,820
and allowing Majin Boo
to be revived at full power.

128
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,410
If we are fortunate, we may be
able to prevent his revival entirely.

129
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,130
What was that?

130
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:32,380
You think I'm going to allow that?

131
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,420
Vegeta, stop them!
Kill those who are in our way!

132
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,260
Kill them!

133
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:50,850
Vegeta, kill those who are in our way! Kill them!

134
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,820
Is this Babidi's magic?

135
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:10,460
Go, Vegeta! Kill them!

136
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,840
Do it! Do them in!

137
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,810
–I refuse!
–What?!

138
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,980
Whatever Kaioshin and the
others do is none of my concern!

139
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:43,860
I-I'm going to say this one more time,
okay? You are to put Kaioshin away!

140
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,960
Well, Vegeta?

141
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,800
Like I said, all I want to do is fight Kakarrot!

142
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,340
I-I am the proud prince of the Saiyans!

143
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,890
You think I would allow
myself to become your serf?

144
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:12,890
You may control my body and my heart,
but at least you will not have your way...

145
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,980
with my pride!!

146
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,760
This is the first time something
like this has happened!

147
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,930
What a man of pride he is!

148
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,720
It does not matter, does it, Babidi-<i>sama</i>?

149
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,270
In any case, his role is to take energy, after all.

150
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:02,900
Even if Kaioshin does come, he
can do nothing so long as I am here.

151
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,740
Besides, is it not what you wanted?

152
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,200
To see Kaioshin die before your very eyes?

153
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,870
U-Unbelievable!

154
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:18,380
To think there's a person that could
defy Babidi while being controlled by him!

155
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:24,920
So, this is how badly you wanted
to settle things between us, Vegeta?

156
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,930
If anything, would it not be better for us

157
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,310
to open the door and
allow Kaioshin to come here?

158
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:37,310
It would not do if he forces it
open and traumatizes the ship,

159
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,780
forcing Majin Boo's return before
he attains his perfect power, would it?

160
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,860
Indeed. You're right, I got you.

161
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,120
He opened it himself!

162
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,120
He would be disserved if
his spaceship were damaged.

163
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,750
Well, Father, we're off!

164
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,300
Mm, hang in there!

165
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,470
Ah, hold up, Gohan!
There's still two <i>senzu</i> left.

166
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,140
They're what are left over from
what you gave your girlfriend.

167
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:16,810
Eat one before you go. You must
have used quite a bit of power earlier.

168
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,650
Th-Thanks.

169
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,950
Get angry, Gohan! Get angry, remember
what happened when you fought Cell,

170
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,700
and call up all the power you possess!

171
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,330
G-Get angry?

172
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:37,790
If you do, you can't lose to any
kind of guy in the whole world!

173
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:40,330
Any kind of guy, you hear?

174
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,170
Right. But Father...

175
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:49,510
It's a shame your one
precious day turned out this way.

176
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,010
Well, we're off!

177
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,230
Sorry to keep you waiting.

178
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:08,780
I have waited, Kakarrot!
I have been waiting so long for this!

179
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:18,700
I do not want to take damage from you
and contribute it to Majin Boo's energy.

180
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,170
I'm going to end this quickly,
with my highest power!

181
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,170
I look forward to it. You'll show me

182
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,840
the fruits of your training in the Other World.

183
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,430
As I expected. Even greater than
the power Gohan had back then.

184
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,380
Judging by that, it doesn't look
like this is going to end quickly.

185
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:09,380
Here we go! I'll kill you, Kakarrot!

186
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,760
<i>The determination of Goku,</i>
<i>who turned aside even Kaioshin!</i>

187
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,310
<i>The pride of Vegeta, who</i>
<i>thrust aside Babidi's orders!</i>

188
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,440
<i>Vegeta versus Goku! The most</i>
<i>incomparable conflict in history,</i>

189
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,810
<i>one nobody is able to stop, begins now!</i>

190
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,820
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

191
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,410
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

192
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,970
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

193
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

194
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,110
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

195
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,490
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

196
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,320
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

197
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

198
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,960
<i>Even now?</i>

199
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,590
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

200
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,970
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

201
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:48,480
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

202
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:58,490
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

203
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,920
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

204
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,380
<i>While I'm fighting Vegeta, somehow or other</i>

205
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,390
<i>you have to reach wherever</i>
<i>Babidi is, Kaioshin-sama.</i>

206
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:24,270
<i>Let's hurry, Gohan-san!</i>
<i>If we just stand idly by,</i>

207
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:28,600
<i>all that damage energy will</i>
<i>keep being delivered to Boo's egg!</i>

208
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,650
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

209
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,610
<i>"Just You Wait, Babidi!!</i>
<i>Your Aspirations Will Not Be Allowed."</i>

210
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,150
<i>There's no way I'm going</i>
<i>to let the Majin be revived!</i>

211
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:39,610
"Next time"
"Just You Wait, Babidi!!
Your Aspirations Will Not Be Allowed"
