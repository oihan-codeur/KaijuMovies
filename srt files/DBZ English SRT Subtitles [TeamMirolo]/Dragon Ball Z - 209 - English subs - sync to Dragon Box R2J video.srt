–Father!

I've missed you, too.

Father...?

31
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,050
Father!

32
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,720
You sure are spirited!
You look strong, just like me!

33
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,640
Goku...

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,020
I'll remind you one more time,
you've only got 24 hours. Got it?

35
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,520
Yeah, understood.

36
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,400

Let's shoot over there!

39
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,860
Hi! Where are you from?

40
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,690
I'm from Satan City.

41
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,770
Despite how I might look,
I work out at Satan Dojo.

42
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,700
I wonder if Gohan-<i>kun</i> is here yet.

43
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,080
Videl!

44
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,830
Shapner...

45
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,590
Videl, I'm celebrating
your victory in advance.

46
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,590
You don't say...

47
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,810
I'm going to take some great
shots of you looking cool today, Videl.

48
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,810
Oh yeah?

49
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,110
V-Videl, did you cut your hair?

50
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,980
You can tell just by looking, can't you?

51
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,530
You know, there's a shop near here
that serves a delicious tropical juice.

52
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,790
After the tournament is over,
would you go there with me?

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,840
V-Videl!

54
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,650
Goten, your dead pop is
the spitting image of you, huh?

55
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,150
You think so?

56
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,770
He was amazing, right?

57
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,610
Uh-huh.

58
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:59,620
He doesn't look all that great
to me. My dad seems stronger.

59
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,830
But Big Brother said that Father is
the strongest in the universe, didn't he?

60
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,290
So you do have hair, huh?

61
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,880
I told you a long time ago
that I was shaving it, didn't I?

62
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,840
Why did you grow it out?

63
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,220
I think you looked better without hair.

64
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,180
Well, you see, a lot has happened.

65
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,600
Huh? No. 18! That's No. 18, ain't it?

66
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:33,860
You just now realized? Idiot.

67
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,320
What's No. 18 doing here?!

68
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,700
We're living together at Muten Roshi's place.

69
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,250
Kuririn, does that mean you and No. 18 are...?

70
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:52,500
We also have a child. You
saw her earlier, right? The girl?

71
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,750
What a surprise!

72
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,250
Idiot.

73
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,220
You had a child, even though she's a robot?

74
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,430
She's not either a robot!
No. 18 was human to begin with.

75
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,230
She just got a little bit modified.

76
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,690
Oh, is that right? Kuririn, congratulations.

77
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,600
Yeah, thanks.

78
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,240
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, that's you, right?

79
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,700
Videl-<i>san...</i>

80
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,700
I knew it! Gohan-<i>kun,</i>
why are you wearing that outfit?

81
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,320
Shh!

82
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,710
I'm the Great Saiyaman.

83
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,880
Oh, so that's it.

84
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,880
So, Videl-<i>san</i>, have you
gotten so you can fly really well?

85
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,050
Of course I have. Watch.

86
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,660
Listen, Gohan-<i>kun</i>, I'm not
going to hold back, understand?

87
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,830
Aren't you the formidable opponent?

88
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,670
Videl...

89
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,170
I-I'll just be going...

90
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,260
Hold on! Who are you?!

91
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,640
He's the Great Saiyaman.

92
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,810
Him? You seem to be on
awfully familiar terms, huh?

93
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,810
That's just because he's an ally
in my cooperation with the police

94
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,650
in the fight against evildoers.

95
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,280
Right, Great Saiyaman?

96
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,650
Y-Yes, that's right.

97
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,660
Who the hell are you?!

98
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,700
His true identity is unknown.
Not even I know who he is.

99
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,620
Right, Great Saiyaman?

100
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,120
R-Right.

101
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:00,300
"Right, Great Saiyaman" is it?

102
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:05,300
Goodness! Shapner, you
wouldn't be jealous, would you?

103
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,880
D-Don't be ridiculous!

104

please hurry, as the preliminary is beginning.

108
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,860
Great Saiyaman, we have to hurry!

109
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,860
Videl-<i>san</i>...!

110
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,780
H-Hold on, this is awkward...! Please, let go...!

111
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,710
Dammit!

112
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,670
That miserable Great Saiyaman!
Just who is that guy?!

113
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,720
Thank you very much!

114
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,730
It appears that this bunch
are the last contestants to enter.

115
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,230
Let's shoot them quick, and then
move to the preliminary grounds.

116
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,230
Right, right.

117
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,280
Hi! Where are you from?

118
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,700
Say, haven't we seen
those two someplace before?

119
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,250
You think so?

120
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:19,250
I'm sure I've seen them somewhere...

121
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,250
I still like the way your head looked before...

122
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,670
Hi! Where did you come from?

123
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,760
Where? I... I came from the Next World.

124
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,270
What a kidder!

125
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,770
I ain't kidding you.

126
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,790
Um, that ring over your head is just
an accessory you're wearing, right?

127
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,540
Ah, this? This ain't for
decoration. See, when you die...

128
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,180
Piccolo hasn't changed at all, huh?

129
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,140
Where do you get off breaking the camera?!

130
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,140
Everything we've shot up
to now is ruined, you know!

131
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,150
How could this be? It's strange,
this has never happened before.

132
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,770
Those of you who have to change,
please use this dressing room.

133
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,030
There isn't much time, so please hurry, okay?

134
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,330
Aw... I sure would have
liked to fight with the adults.

135
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,790
You know what, though,

136
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,170
with us entering, you have
to feel sorry for everyone else.

137
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,670
The only ones who look like they'll
be able to stand up to us are each other.

138
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,680
–He's so handsome!
–So handsome!

139
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,550
Let me have your autograph next!

140
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,860
U-Um, you seem a little pale.
Are you all right?

141
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,740
Leave me alone! My face
is supposed to be this color.

142
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,740
W-We beg your pardon!

143
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,910
D-Dammit, what's so
great about Great Saiyaman?

144
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,210
Thanks for waiting!

145
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,090
Sorry to keep you hanging.

146
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,260
Okay, let's go.

147
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,110
Dammit, I'm going to make sure I find
an opening and reveal his true identity!

148
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,650
This place is packed!

149
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,070
Amazing, isn't it?

150
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,990
Nothing but small-timers.

151
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,450
Oh...?

152
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,120
Oh...! It's you guys!

153
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,080
Yo!

154
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,630
What a wonderful day this is!
I didn't think I'd be seeing you again.

155
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,790
Wow, how this takes me back!

156
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:54,460
I've been waiting so long for
you guys to participate again.

157
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,840
It wasn't Mister Satan that
defeated Cell, it was you guys, right?

158
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,470
I knew as much.

159
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,680
To be honest with you,

160
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,810
a Tenkaichi Tournament that doesn't
have you folks participating in it

161
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,640
is the very definition of boring.

162
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,850
The level drops so low, so low...

163
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,480
Is everyone else here friends of yours?

164
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,490
I suppose so.

165
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,650
Wow, that's great, that's great.

166
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:23,290
You there, please don't destroy
the arena like you did before, okay?

167
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,290
We'll see.

168
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,160
This is getting exciting!

169
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,500
This Tenkaichi Tournament
is going to be incredible!

170
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,340
Incidentally, this has been
bothering me for a little while now,

171
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,130
but what is that ring over your head?

172
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:39,050
Oh, I died. It happened
during the fight with Cell.

173
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,180
I've come here specially from
the Next World just for today.

174
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,850
Okay, okay!

175
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,020
That is strange, but with
you guys, anything is possible.

176
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,980
Whether you're dead or whether
you're alive, it's fine with me.

177
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,440
<i>So there are people who</i>
<i>know how great Father was!</i>

178
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,820
Knowing you guys, you'll smash your
way through the preliminary round for sure!

179
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,240
Okay, I'll see you in the ring!

180
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,450
I'm counting on you for some good matches!

181
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,500
Any of you kids who want
my autograph, line up, line up!

182
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,880
The first fifty of you who get here will
get them for free, as my present to you!

183
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,050
Ah, it's Satan!

184
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:25,680
Satan! Satan! Satan!

185
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,730
They say that death is the only cure for idiocy,

186
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,440
but he'll probably be the
same even after he dies, huh?

187
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,110
If I can get his sunglasses off,
I can find out his true identity...!

188
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,400
Come on, let's go.

189
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,960
Damn... And I was so close, too...

190
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,920
To those of you who are assembled,

191
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,090
we will now begin the preliminary
round for the Tenkaichi Tournament.

192
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,430
The total number of entrants in this tournament
is 194, not including the Junior Division.

193
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,310
Of those, only the 16 contestants that
win their way through the preliminary round

194
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,600
will be able to participate.

195
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,270
However, the champion, Mister Satan,

196
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,070
will be allowed to participate unconditionally,

197
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,700
so we will now select the
remaining 15 contestants.

198
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,620
What are we doing?

199
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,460
In order for the preliminary
round to be conducted fairly,

200
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,460
it will be held using a Punch Machine.

201
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,010
Those 15 who have the
highest Punch Machine scores

202
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,300
will pass the preliminary.

203
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,720
Punch Machine? What's that?

204
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,860
You're all mine!

205
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,030
Damn! And I was so close, too!

206
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,870
Now then, we will have
the champion, Mister Satan,

207
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,660
hit the Punch Machine to serve as reference,

208
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,160
and see what kind of value it returns.

209
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,290
And now, the champion,
Mister Satan, if you please!

210
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,760
Who among you will surpass me?!

211
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,740
There's plenty of guys here that surpass you.

212
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,740
Over here!

213
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,670
Big Brother...

214
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,250
Pick me up.

215
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,260
This time, for sure...

216
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,390
I did it! I may not have been
able to tell with my naked eyes,

217
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,440
but the camera is sure to
have captured his uncovered face!

218
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,070
I, Shapner-<i>sama</i>, will reveal the
true identity of the Great Saiyaman!

219
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,440
Come on, don't be shy! Take all
the pictures you want, I don't mind!

220
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,240
<i>How long is he going to act so cocky?</i>

221
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,460
M-My camera! And after
I managed to shoot him, too!

222
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,470
Piccolo-<i>san...</i>

223
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,980
I've destroyed all the cameras,
including the ones the spectators have.

224
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,770
Now, even if your disguise
does come off by some chance,

225
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:03,060
you won't be found out
by anyone at your school.

226
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,070
You can fight without
having to worry about that.

227
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,440
Thanks, Piccolo-<i>san.</i>

228
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,070
What's this? What's going on?

229
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:13,030
I guess I've got no choice
but to do this without any press.

230
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,730
Th-There it is! 137! 137 points!

231
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,530
That's my Papa!

232
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,170
Okay, everyone, good luck!

233
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,670
I'll be waiting for a
contestant that I can take seriously!

234
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,050
All right then, will all contestants
please take a numbered ticket

235
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,680
and line up in front of the Punch Machine.

236
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:21,520
Also, all of the kids who will be participating
in the Junior Division, please gather over here.

237
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,480
Well, well, at that rate, Satan
is going to win again this time.

238
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,690
Good luck, kids.

239
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,030
I wonder if Tenshinhan and them are coming.

240
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,490
Probably not.

241
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,290
He did say that it's unlikely
we'd ever see each other again.

242
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,670
Number 6, 97 points.

243
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,890
Number 16, 77 points.

244
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,400
Videl, good luck.

245
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,810
Videl, make sure you win.

246
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,950
Whoa, there's an amazing score!
Number 86, 112 points!

247
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,780
Sheesh, this is nonsense.

248
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,410
Okay, next is number 84.

249
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,790
Hey, look, it's a woman!
And she's a fine woman, isn't she?

250
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,790
Whew, I'd sure like to fight her!

251
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,260
Hey, don't put too much power into it, now.

252
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,420
You'll break the machine.

253
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,010
I know!

254
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,430
S-S-Seven hundred seventy-four?!

255
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,440
I'm sorry, but there appears
to have been a malfunction.

256
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,780
Please wait a moment.

257
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,900
This is why I told you not to overdo it!

258
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,280
Hush, would you? It's hard to hold back!

259
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,780
I-It appears to be fixed now, so once again...

260
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,090
203 points...

261
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,850
Number 85, 192 points...

262
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,850
Number 86, 186 points...

263
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,370
Number 87, 210 points.

264
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:44,040
Th-This thing appears to be
completely busted, all right.

265
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,370
Let's get a new Punch Machine ready.

266
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,620
Right.

267
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,420
Get back.

268
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,630
You're kidding...!

269
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,140
Ah, there's just no helping him.

270
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,060
<i>Vegeta doesn't know how to hold back.</i>

271
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,030
<i>Even Videl is left speechless</i>
<i>by such overwhelming power.</i>

272
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,030
<i>Goku and the others have all</i>
<i>passed the preliminary round easily.</i>

273
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,550
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

274
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:45,140
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

275
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:55,690
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

276
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:01,820
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

277
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:08,830
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

278
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:14,210
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

279
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,050
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

280
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:27,140
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

281
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,680
<i>Even now?</i>

282
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:36,310
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

283
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:41,690
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

284
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:48,200
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

285
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:58,210
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

286
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,350
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

287
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:21,230
<i>The kids' matches have begun.</i>
<i>Aw, geez, ignorance can be scary!</i>

288
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,070
<i>Trunks' opponent has</i>
<i>started to give him a hard time.</i>

289
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,740
<i>This guy is being so lame.</i>
<i>He's such an annoying dweeb.</i>

290
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,280
<i>Maybe, just for a little bit,</i>
<i>I won't hold back on him.</i>

291
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,240
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

292
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,750
<i>"No Small Matter!! Little Trunks."</i>

293
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,960
<i>No, no, don't draw any attention, Trunks!</i>

294
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,750
"Next time"
"No Small Matter!! Little Trunks"
