<i>Piccolo, Gohan, and Kuririn</i>

20
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,270
<i>However, the Saiyans</i>

21
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,840
<i>instead, they brought forth six strange</i>
<i>creatures, called Saibaimen, out from the dirt.</i>

22
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,190
Those three are your targets.
Do them some harm, Saibaimen.

<i>"Yamucha Dies!</i>

R-Right!

26
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,200
There's nothing to be afraid of.

27
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,400
Right!

28
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,080
Gohan, don't lose your nerve!

29
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
R-Right!

30
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,990
This time, shall we take the fight to them?

31
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,360
Kuririn!

32
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,330
Tenshinhan!

33
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,770
Chaozu, you're here, too?

34
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,210
Mm-hmm!

35
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,040
Weren't there only
supposed to be two Saiyans?

36
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,480
Well, a lot has happened.
It looks like there are more of them.

37
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,150
However many there are, it's all the same.

38
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:58,120
Is that him? Goku's son?

39
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,490
Yeah. He appears to have
been trained quite a bit by Piccolo.

40
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,230
He's got a fine look to him.

41
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,800
What shrimps...

42
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Saibaimen, make them all suffer!

43
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,180
Just a minute!

44
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,790
Kuririn, sorry I'm late.

45
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,600
Yamucha<i>-san</i>!

46
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,200
I guess we're all here, except for Goku.

47
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,800
Yeah!

48
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,140
1... 2... 3... 4... 5... 6, huh?

49
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,210
Interesting. The exact number
of Saibaimen that we have here.

50
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,380
Yes, it is.

51
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:02,760
How about you all take turns
fighting each one of our soldiers?

52
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,520
It will be a game.

53
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,490
A game?! Ridiculous!

54
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,760
Stop beating around the bush
and let's settle this right here and now!

55
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,370
Now, now, where's the harm? It works
out better for our side to do it this way.

56
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,770
Goku hasn't arrived yet, after all.

57
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,570
Very well.

58
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,570
I'll lead off. Now, come and get it!

59
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:35,250
He's going to be bowled over once he
realizes how strong the Saibaimen are!

60
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,360
So, which one of you is going to face me?

61
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,060
You go first. Hammer him
with all you've got. Understood?

62
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,570
T-Ten<i>-san</i>, good luck!

63
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,260
We're going to start reporting
from above the scene now...

64
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,230
Whoa! Those are the Saiyans!

65
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,300
The Saiyans!

66
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,170
Noisy mosquitoes!

67
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:49,160
Okay, Saibaiman!
Don't hold back! Crush him!

68
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,200
These Saiyans appear to possess
tremendous power. Is everything all right?

69
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,650
You idiot! 'Course everything ain't all right!

70
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,990
L-Like I said, my boys're fightin'
with 'em for your sakes right now!

71
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,360
–Who do you mean when you say "my boys"?
–Won't you be surprised when I tell ya!

72
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,790
The winner of the
Tenkaichi Tournament, Son Goku.

73
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,360
With him're Tenshinhan, and Piccolo, as well.

74
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,800
That is amazing!

75
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,400
So, everything'll be okay.

76
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,000
Prob'ly...

77
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,370
<i>There's a good chance</i>
<i>that this'll be my last meal...</i>

78
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,680
<i>But I can't tell 'em that!</i>

79
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,750
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>, are you sure
that Goku has been returned to life?

80
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,890
Gyumao!

81
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,090
He should be heading to where
Piccolo and the others are, right now.

82
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,820
W-Well then...

83
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,330
W-Where is my Gohan?

84
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,070
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>, where is my Gohan?

85
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,270
He's still with Piccolo and the others.

86
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,080
Chichi!

87
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,860
I-Incredible!

88
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,500
W-What?!

89
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,670
You did it!

90
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,040
That's Tenshinhan for you!

91
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,670
Incredible!

92
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,350
I-Impossible!

93
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,360
Saibaimen have a battle power of 1,200.

94
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,690
They're on par with
Raditz, as far as power goes!

95
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,700
His battle power must be higher than that.

96
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,640
B-But...

97
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,200
It's simple arithmetic.

98
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,570
That wasn't in our data...

99
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,710
Nappa, it looks like these guys
are going to be somewhat entertaining.

100
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,590
Ten<i>-san</i>! He's getting up!

101
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,400
V-Vegeta! How could you do that?

102
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,380
<i>W-What is this strange uneasiness I'm feeling?</i>

103
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,050
<i>I've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

104
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,530
<i>Piccolo, hang in there somehow</i>
<i>until I get back! I'm counting on you!</i>

105
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,050
W-Why?

106
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:10,420
Anything more would be a
waste of time. He couldn't win.

107
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,220
That Saibaiman took him
too lightly when he attacked.

108
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,360
I told him to go at it with everything he's got.

109
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,800
H-How could he do that?!

110
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,270
<i>T-That Saiyan blew that</i>
<i>monster to bits in the blink of an eye!</i>

111
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,140
<i>What destructive force!</i>

112
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,480
We'll be okay from here.
This special lens is working out great!

113
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:44,250
There's so much energy colliding
in the area, we can't get very close.

114
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:50,760
This is almost as if the end of the world
were approaching, it's such a spectacle.

115
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,190
Now, who's going to be next?

116
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:21,050
You guys, go all-out from the start this time!

117
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,630
A-All right... I'll face them.

118
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,030
Wait, Kuririn.

119
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,030
Yamucha<i>-san...</i>

120
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:35,200
Let me do this. I want to show them
that we've had enough of their games.

121
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,640
Yamucha<i>-san, I</i> can do that–

122
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,280
You've already been brought
back to life once by the Dragon Balls.

123
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,950
Supposing that the unthinkable happens,
you couldn't come back to life again.

124
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,190
Let me handle this. I'm going to take
care of the other five all at the same time.

125
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,660
Y-Yamucha<i>-san...</i>

126
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,400
What a beautiful friendship you
must have. All right, you take him on.

127
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,630
All right, come on!
Don't you take us so lightly!

128
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,630
He's getting cocky.

129
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,400
Give us a look...

130
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,340
...at how truly terrifying you Saibaimen are!

131
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,640
T-These are the Saiyans!

132
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,550
These are the Saiyans that have
plunged us into depths of terror!

133
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,390
Oh, that face!

134
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,060
It's one of the regulars
from the Tenkaichi Tournament!

135
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,590
Yamucha!

136
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,830
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>'s face is
looking even tougher now, isn't it?

137
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,600
It's not just his face.
His abilities are a lot greater now, too.

138
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,940
Bulma, you're taken with him again, aren't you?

139
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,240
D-Don't be silly!

140
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,940
Once they defeat the Saiyans, you
could get married, couldn't you, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

141
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,080
Y-You don't mean–I mean, marriage!

142
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,420
Oh, that's the face of Piccolo Daimao!

143
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,230
It's Gohan!

144
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,260
G-Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

145
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,470
He's lookin' a lot tougher, huh?

146
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,780
Gohan<i>-chan...</i> Look at how you've become...

147
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,290
G-Gohan<i>-chan</i> is in the same
place as those revoltin' monsters?

148
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,360
Chichi!

149
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,330
W-Why isn't Goku there?

150
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,780
T-They vanished!

151
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,820
You fool! They're moving at high speed!
Try feeling out the movement of their <i>ki.</i>

152
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,620
T-The movement of their <i>ki</i>?

153
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,190
Everyone except for you can see them.

154
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,030
You all can see them? All right, then!

155
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,400
Use your whole body as your eyes.

156
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,730
My whole body as my eyes?

157
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,090
Do you see them?

158
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,360
I see them!

159
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,240
You're not getting away!

160
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,560
You did it!

161
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,560
I-Incredible!

162
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,230
He did it!

163
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,970
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!

164
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:00,440
Yamucha did it!

165
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,450
Not again!

166
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:26,230
Looks like these monsters
aren't as strong as you think they are.

167
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,830
W-What did you say?

168
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,670
Keep your head, Nappa.

169
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,580
I'll take care of the other four by myself, too.

170
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,610
It appears that this time, <i>you're</i> the
ones who took the Saibaimen too lightly.

171
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,780
What?

172
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,780
Oh, crap!

173
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,080
N-No!

174
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,150
Yamucha!

175
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,560
Yes. That will do.

176
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,370
W-What a fiend! He blew himself up!

177
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,230
H-How awful!

178
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,390
H-He's dead...

179
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,930
W-What's wrong with Yamucha?
What happened, Oolong?

180
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,870
I-I'm not sure. I couldn't hear what he said.

181
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:26,050
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>! Yamucha<i>-sama</i>! Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!

182
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:33,260
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!

183
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,410
Bulma...

184
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,410
No!

185
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,560
Y-Yamucha<i>-san</i> must have
had a bad feeling about this.

186
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,470
T-That's why he went in my place. Damn it all!

187
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:27,240
Damn it all! What do I
tell Pu-erh and Bulma<i>-san</i>?!

188
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,310
What a pathetic Saibaiman–ending in a draw!

189
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,520
What did he think he was
doing, against scum like that?!

190
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,690
Hey, clean that filth up.
He's polluting up the place.

191
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,130
You dirty bastard!

192
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,690
Get back, everyone!

193
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,700
Yamucha<i>-san,</i>

194
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,870
I'll avenge you, no matter what!

195
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,350
Let me show you the results of my training!

196
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:23,200
<i>Having watched Yamucha die</i>
<i>before his eyes, Kuririn's fury has erupted!</i>

197
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,680
<i>What were the results of his training?</i>

198
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,890
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

199
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:54,760
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

200
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,140
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

201
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,640
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

202
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,110
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

203
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,220
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

204
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,720
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

205
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,390
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

206
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,900
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

207
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,970
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

208
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,800
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

209
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,870
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

210
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:45,550
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

211
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,720
<i>So sorry.</i>

212
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,820
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

213
00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:00,800
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

214
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,310
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

215
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,450
<i>Damn it, right on the heels of</i>
<i>Yamucha, now Chaozu is going to die?</i>

216
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,150
<i>Chaozu has already been brought</i>
<i>back to life by the Dragonballs once.</i>

217
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,320
<i>He can't ever be brought back again!</i>

218
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,750
<i>You're going to pay for this, Saiyan!</i>

219
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,520
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

220
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:31,160
<i>"Farewell, Ten-san!</i>
<i>Chaozu's Suicide Strategy."</i>

221
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,340
<i>Father! Come quickly!</i>

222
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,700
"Next time"
"Farewell, Ten<i>-san</i>!
Chaozu's Suicide Strategy"
