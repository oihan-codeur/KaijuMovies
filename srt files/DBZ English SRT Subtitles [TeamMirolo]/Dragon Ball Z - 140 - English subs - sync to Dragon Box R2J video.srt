<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:56,615
Son Goku's house is in a
mountain village in Sector 439 West.

17
00:01:56,655 --> 00:02:03,715
<i>To protect the ailing Goku from</i>

00:02:10,165 --> 00:02:13,865
<i>Just then, some disturbing</i>
<i>facts make themselves known.</i>

20
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:20,065
Tell me, how many time
machines did my future self make?

21
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:24,075
How many? It was all you
could do to build just one.

22
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:26,275
Yeah? This is really strange then.

23
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:28,505
This is definitely a time machine.

24
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:35,015
Trunks, here you go.

25
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:40,855
<i>Another time machine.</i>
<i>Who could have been inside it?</i>

26
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:49,235
<i>"The Discovery of an Evil Egg!!</i>
<i>A Terrified Trunks."</i>

27
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:00,445
There's no mistake.

28
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:04,245
This is the exact same
time machine I rode back in.

29
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:07,185
How can this possibly be?

30
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:10,885
Does she know the exact location
of where this photo was taken?

31
00:03:11,655 --> 00:03:16,025
He asks if you know exactly
where this time machine is.

32
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:17,825
It doesn't say exactly,

33
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,395
but I think it has to be somewhere
around Sector 1050 West.

34
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,225
Are you going?

35
00:03:22,265 --> 00:03:25,395
Yes. I'd like to see this with my own eyes.

36
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:29,475
Well, I'm going too. It's not too far from here.

37
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:31,235
U-Understood.

38
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:33,445
See you later.

39
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,845
You're sure there's only one time machine, then?

40
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,045
Yes, positive.

41
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:42,015
Um...

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,415
I'll go looking with you. Is it okay if I come?

43
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:47,425
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

44
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,855
It's all right, Mother.

45
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:52,595
We aren't going anywhere
dangerous, so you needn't worry.

46
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:54,825
That ain't it!

47
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:57,465
You're right in the middle of studyin'.

48
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:04,275
I'll do it all when I get back.

49
00:04:25,495 --> 00:04:28,905
Ah, here's some water for you!

50
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:38,035
Mama, I have to go out for
a bit, can you watch Trunks?

51
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:42,605
Goodness! Bulma<i>-chan</i>, where are you off to?

52
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:47,015
I have to go meet up with the big Trunks.

53
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:11,275
Um, Trunks<i>-san</i>, in the future,

54
00:05:11,315 --> 00:05:13,275
you say your world was really devastated,

55
00:05:13,315 --> 00:05:16,075
because of those two Artificial Humans?

56
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:21,745
Yes. The world's population has been
reduced to several tens of thousands.

57
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:24,455
Most of Metro West lies in a state of ruin.

58
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:29,455
Somehow, we manage to survive by
hiding in secret underground bases.

59
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,455
That bad?

60
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:36,435
I sure hope we can find some
weakness in the Artificial Humans.

61
00:05:36,475 --> 00:05:39,035
Yeah.

62
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,265
There was that time...

63
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:45,875
The two Artificial Humans
went against Doctor Gero.

64
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:50,275
No. 17! What's this?!

65
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:52,875
We have no use for the likes of this.

66
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,855
But he was so far into the corner by then,

67
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:00,485
he had no choice but to use them.

68
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,235
Haven't you understood a single thing I've said?!

69
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,265
Don't push that switch!

70
00:06:29,695 --> 00:06:33,655
In the end, he was killed by them.

71
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:38,425
However, Doctor Gero must have
determined how dangerous they were,

72
00:06:38,465 --> 00:06:39,895
using progressively riskier tests.

73
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,595
I think he must have had some kind of device

74
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:47,405
to shut them down in an emergency.

75
00:06:47,445 --> 00:06:51,875
If he hadn't, do you think he
would have reactivated them?

76
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,415
Of course, that must be it!

77
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:58,945
There's a slim possibility...

78
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:16,265
Section 1050 West should be under us now.

79
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,135
Let's start looking.

80
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:07,315
There it is! There it is!

81
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,455
Trunks<i>-san</i>, it's over here!

82
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:24,295
Way to find it, Gohan<i>-san</i>!

83
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:31,275
That must be Bulma<i>-san.</i>

84
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:33,305
I'll lead her down here.

85
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:09,875
Hi, Trunks!

86
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:19,885
It's your beautiful mother!

87
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,055
Indeed.

88
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:28,535
Well? Let me know what you think,
seeing your mom all young like this.

89
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:33,405
I-It's just... Mom, you
don't really change that much.

90
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:35,835
I don't change?

91
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:40,605
That means I'll keep my
beauty for decades to come!

92
00:09:40,645 --> 00:09:43,615
I hope no one blames me for it.

93
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:50,485
More to the point, please look at this.

94
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:08,035
This is the time machine I came
in, and had reduced to a Capsule.

95
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:13,245
Gee, then there's no way
this older one could be yours.

96
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:14,445
Not exactly.

97
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:19,245
You only built one time machine in the future.

98
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,815
This is also the very same time
machine I used to come back in.

99
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,055
No way.

100
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:25,855
Look at this.

101
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:37,065
"Hope."<i>Kibô</i>?
[<i>Kibô</i>: hope]

102
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:41,065
Yeah. These are the letters
you wrote here when I took off.

103
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:45,675
Naturally, they appear on
the other time machine as well.

104
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:50,075
But how can that be?

105
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:54,485
It looks like this one has
been here for quite a while.

106
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:01,825
Hmm? This hole is strange.

107
00:11:01,865 --> 00:11:04,025
It's like the glass melted from intense heat.

108
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:07,295
But this hole was made from the inside.

109
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:14,465
S-So, what? Was anyone inside this one?

110
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:17,475
In any event, let's open this up.

111
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:18,475
Excuse me.

112
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,095
There's one here, too.

113
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,315
What's that you've got?

114
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:06,215
It doesn't appear to be a coconut.

115
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:08,955
What? Say, give me a look.

116
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:10,965
Here.

117
00:12:21,245 --> 00:12:22,505
No doubt about it.

118
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:25,105
This is some kind of eggshell.

119
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,945
Eggshell?

120
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:33,115
If that's an egg, I've never
seen another egg like it.

121
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:49,005
Do you suppose that whatever
made that hole hatched from the egg?

122
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:56,535
The energy reserves are almost on zero.

123
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,445
It came here from...

124
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:05,715
Age 788?

125
00:13:05,755 --> 00:13:09,115
That's three years later than the time I left!

126
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,315
Three more years into the future!

127
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:15,525
It arrived in this era...

128
00:13:17,095 --> 00:13:19,225
Nearly four years ago!

129
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:24,135
This arrived here fully a year
before I appeared the first time.

130
00:13:28,105 --> 00:13:33,505
W-What could have come back
in here, and for what purpose?

131
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:38,985
Could this be the reason history
has changed so drastically?

132
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:45,155
...and that's how it went.

133
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,185
All of that happened, huh?

134
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:53,195
It'd be great if Goku were able to get
better before they come looking here.

135
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:56,535
All we can do now is pray that he does.

136
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:07,205
Just a minute!

137
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:10,145
If the Artificial Humans are after Goku,

138
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:14,045
won't this house be the very
next place they come looking?!

139
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:17,055
Yeah, probably so.

140
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:22,225
So, doesn't that make this the
next most dangerous place on Earth?!

141
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:24,995
I got no patience for being in harm's way.

142
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,895
Hey, I'm still here, you know.

143
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:34,205
I won't be defeated by
them so easily. Right, Kuririn?

144
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:36,635
And I'm just supposed to rely on you, then?

145
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,905
What did you dare say?

146
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:42,205
I'm still Muten Roshi, spoken
of as the god of martial arts!

147
00:14:42,245 --> 00:14:46,185
I've even won the Tenkaichi
Tournament, you know!

148
00:14:47,185 --> 00:14:49,315
That all happened a long time ago!

149
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,055
Now you're simply a lecherous old man!

150
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:54,955
You plan on defeating the
Artificial Humans with lechery?

151
00:14:58,095 --> 00:15:02,165
Hey, No. 16. You really are
the silent type, aren't you?

152
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:05,235
Don't you find it dull to
keep all bottled up like that?

153
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,735
Come on, say something.

154
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:12,975
I mean, we're all taking special care
to enjoy ourselves like this, aren't we?

155
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:18,715
Give it up, No. 18.

156
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:22,115
He's got nothing on his
mind besides killing Son Goku.

157
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:24,915
Besides which, we're coming up on a town.

158
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:27,225
You're still looking to get
some new clothes, right?

159
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:28,285
You bet!

160
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,725
I can finally part ways with these torn-up rags.

161
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:33,135
Speed up, already!

162
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,075
You know, I really am a genius!

163
00:15:44,115 --> 00:15:47,135
I build a time machine in the future, after all!

164
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:56,045
In any case, we can't just leave
these time machines sitting around.

165
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:58,525
For now, let's turn them back into Capsules.

166
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:10,235
I'll return this one to a Capsule.

167
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:12,135
Yes, please do.

168
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:19,735
I'll take this strange eggshell with me.

169
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,545
Yes, be my guest.

170
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:30,145
Bulma<i>-san</i>, the rest of us, we've gotten
together at Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>'s home.

171
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:32,185
The Kame House?

172
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,455
How come?

173
00:16:33,495 --> 00:16:38,695
Long story short, three Artificial
Humans have been reactivated,

174
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:42,025
and are aiming to take my father's life.

175
00:16:42,065 --> 00:16:45,495
But, since Father is down
with his illness, in his state,

176
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:48,035
they took him there to hide him from them.

177
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:49,935
Well, why don't the whole lot of you

178
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,635
just get together and put them all away?

179
00:16:52,675 --> 00:16:54,505
You must be kidding!

180
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:59,145
Dad, myself, Piccolo<i>-san</i> and
Tenshinhan<i>-san</i> all took them on,

181
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,515
but we were powerless against them!

182
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:05,655
Wow, they really must be incredible.
How's Vegeta? Is he all right?

183
00:17:05,695 --> 00:17:08,055
Did Vegeta go to the Kame House with you?

184
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,525
He survived with the help of a senzu bean.

185
00:17:10,565 --> 00:17:15,625
But Dad didn't join up with us.
He went off somewhere else.

186
00:17:15,665 --> 00:17:18,735
That's just like him.

187
00:17:18,775 --> 00:17:20,505
What is it?

188
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:24,035
Nothing, I'm just wondering what that is...

189
00:17:24,075 --> 00:17:26,945
Huh? What, where?

190
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:42,125
Please, come have a look at this!

191
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,125
What, what's wrong?

192
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,725
What is it, Gohan<i>-san</i>?

193
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,205
Over there.

194
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,145
What is that?

195
00:18:01,985 --> 00:18:05,215
It's huge. What made this?

196
00:18:05,255 --> 00:18:07,945
I-Is it dead?

197
00:18:15,165 --> 00:18:18,225
It isn't dead, it's a shell that's been cast-off.

198
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,095
A shell?

199
00:18:20,135 --> 00:18:23,225
You mean the cicadas
grow this big around here?

200
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:26,135
There are no cicadas like this.

201
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,635
Could it be...?

202
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,135
Probably,

203
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,235
this is from whatever came out of
the egg back in the time machine.

204
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:37,245
Yeah. It must have started
growing, and then shed its skin.

205
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,045
What does that mean?

206
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,215
What could have possibly
come out of a skin like this?

207
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,215
I don't know. I've never seen anything like this.

208
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:47,725
But how did it come to be here?

209
00:18:47,765 --> 00:18:51,625
Who could have sent
this egg back through time?

210
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:55,225
For that matter, someone could
have come back with this egg as well.

211
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:58,965
I don't have any idea what's going on any more.

212
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:08,645
Whatever came out of here,
it must have just barely happened.

213
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:05,135
What do you think?

214
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:08,505
In all honesty, you've got
a bad feeling about this too?

215
00:20:08,545 --> 00:20:09,905
Yes!

216
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:13,875
Well, I guess I should get out of here.

217
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:17,045
You guys will be at the Kame House, right?

218
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,715
If anything happens, I'll be in touch.

219
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,315
Right.

220
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:24,085
Trunks, if you get the time, come visit!

221
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,115
Grandma and Grandpa will love it!

222
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:39,235
<i>What exactly is happening now?</i>

223
00:20:39,275 --> 00:20:41,165
<i>I don't know!</i>

224
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:42,975
<i>I absolutely do not know!</i>

225
00:20:57,455 --> 00:21:00,525
Still peeping down on the lower realm?

226
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:03,055
Can't say I approve of your little pastime.

227
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:08,225
I guess that ability will likely
disappear once you become one with me.

228
00:21:08,265 --> 00:21:11,065
Enjoy it now, while you still can.

229
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,635
So, the uneasiness I've felt in
my heart these last four years,

230
00:21:13,675 --> 00:21:17,065
it was not a result of the
Artificial Humans after all.

231
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:18,705
I'm not sure what it is either.

232
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:22,545
What did come back in that time machine?

233
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:23,745
What?

234
00:21:23,785 --> 00:21:29,145
All I know is that there is a life
form down on Earth somewhere,

235
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:32,585
one that possesses an even greater
power than even the Artificial Humans.

236
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,485
What are you talking about?!

237
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:37,125
Tell me what's going on!

238
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:41,725
To be sure, the day when I turn to
Piccolo and forsake my office as Kami,

239
00:21:41,765 --> 00:21:46,175
and we stand together
as one has finally arrived.

240
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:51,135
Very soon now...

241
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:54,745
Very soon now, something
terrible will happen on Earth.

242
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:58,315
This is not the kind of crisis Earth
has faced so many times before.

243
00:21:58,355 --> 00:22:02,185
I have a hopelessly dreadful feeling about this.

244
00:22:04,995 --> 00:22:10,985
<i>A being that comes from</i>
<i>a future even beyond Trunks.</i>

245
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:21,035
<i>Elsewhere, the Artificial Humans</i>
<i>continue to pursue Goku.</i>

246
00:22:21,075 --> 00:22:28,985
<i>Danger swells up on all sides.</i>
<i>Goku, get better soon!</i>

247
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:48,695
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

248
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:54,535
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

249
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,905
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

250
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

251
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:11,915
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

254
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,165
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

255
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

256
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,775
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

257
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,575
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

258
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

259
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

260
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

261
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,595
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

262
00:23:55,335 --> 00:24:00,605
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

263
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,415
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

264
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:17,755
<i>All the people in Gingertown</i>
<i>have been wiped out?</i>

265
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:20,655
<i>Ain't no doubt, whoever came</i>
<i>in that time machine did this!</i>

266
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:23,755
<i>Piccolo, it looks like the time</i>
<i>for us to merge has finally come.</i>

267
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,795
<i>Hurry! Right now what the</i>

268
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:28,325
<i>but rather, the mighty!</i>
