3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

7

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

10

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:54,525
<i>Before the overwhelming</i>
<i>might of the Artificial Humans,</i>

17
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:57,725
<i>Piccolo and the others endured a total defeat.</i>

18
00:01:57,765 --> 00:01:59,595
<i>However...</i>

19
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:08,905
Damn those Artificial Human
bastards! Toy with me, will they?!

20
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:13,935
They're going to regret turning me,
Vegeta<i>-sama</i>, back without finishing the job!

21
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:21,245
I am a demon clansman! Don't you ever forget–

22
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:25,455
I'm just using you to
help me take over the world!

23
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:34,595
I think he's lying about taking over the world.

24
00:02:34,635 --> 00:02:36,565
I'm sure Piccolo...

25
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:39,235
...has gone to become his
original self with Kami<i>-sama,</i>

26
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:42,435
thereby becoming a Super Namekian.

27
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:56,455
<i>The time when Piccolo and</i>
<i>Kami-sama reunite has finally come.</i>

28
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:05,325
<i>"Walking Weapons of Mass Destruction!!</i>
<i>The Artificial Humans Draw Near Goku."</i>

29
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:44,835
K-Kami<i>-sama...</i>

30
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:49,535
You must know why it is I've come to this place.

31
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,405
Yes, I know.

32
00:03:53,445 --> 00:04:00,815
Originally, me and you–or more accurately,
your father–were a single person.

33
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:05,215
I imagine I understand
what it is you are thinking.

34
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:07,425
In that case, I won't waste my breath.

35
00:04:07,465 --> 00:04:11,395
Quite honestly, I did not
think the day would come...

36
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:14,265
...that our destinies should come together again.

37
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:15,595
We won't be fusing together.

38
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:21,435
You will serve only as the means
for a super power-up for Piccolo.

39
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:26,885
The only justification you have for your
existence any more are the Dragon Balls!

40
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,445
I-It can't be!

41
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:43,025
Your words... are true indeed.

42
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:47,225
Before I had realized it,

43
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:51,265
you had opened up a great
difference between our powers.

44
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:33,805
As you faced one great
opponent after another,

45
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:38,845
my powers were becoming all but inadequate.

46
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:48,785
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>, that not true!

47
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:52,455
Kami<i>-sama</i> has duty as Kami<i>-sama</i>!

48
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:57,305
It's quite all right, Mister Popo.

49
00:06:00,645 --> 00:06:05,135
Even Trunks, who was able to bury
Freeza and his father in a moment's time.

50
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:10,445
As well as Trunks' father Vegeta, possessed
of an even greater ability than Trunks...

51
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,855
...were brought to such a terrible
state by the Artificial Humans.

52
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:27,465
Even when Son Goku
recovers from his affliction,

53
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:31,465
he will likely meet with similar results.

54
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:35,465
It appears the time for Kami and Daimao...

55
00:06:35,505 --> 00:06:38,405
...to become one again has come after all.

56
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:44,215
That's right. What the Earth
needs right now is not a Kami,

57
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:49,845
it's me, coupled with the super
power I need to defeat those guys.

58
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:57,025
Provided that... we observe
events for a short while longer.

59
00:06:57,065 --> 00:06:59,525
What's that–? Observe?!

60
00:06:59,565 --> 00:07:05,095
Correct. To determine whether or not
those three will bring harm to the Earth.

61
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:07,835
How can you say such a leisurely thing?!

62
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,535
After the way they–

63
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:13,575
You were the ones who picked that fight!

64
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:19,885
Besides which, they did
not attempt to kill any of you.

65
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:22,285
You disgust me.

66
00:07:22,325 --> 00:07:25,885
While you were up here,
looking on at the world from afar,

67
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,885
did you not hear what Trunks came to say?

68
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:34,525
He told us that the future
lies in ruins because of them!

69
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:37,395
I also heard that the future
Artificial Humans that Trunks knows...

70
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:43,275
...are somewhat different from
these current Artificial Humans.

71
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:49,205
I don't suppose you're thinking that
these guys might actually be little darlings?

72
00:07:49,245 --> 00:07:51,045
I'm not saying anything of the sort.

73
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:53,915
But if this is to be the last
judgment I make as myself,

74
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,615
then I would like a
conclusive reason to proceed.

75
00:07:56,655 --> 00:07:59,255
You worthless coward!

76
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,455
Fine, very well then.

77
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:10,835
I'll be waiting right here.

78
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:20,845
Waiting until the irrevocable happens,
and you finally make up your mind.

79
00:08:42,965 --> 00:08:45,535
Hey, Kuririn!

80
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:50,435
I'm going to go pick up
Chaozu and continue our training.

81
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:51,605
You are?

82
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:55,375
If the situation gets
bad once again, I'll be back.

83
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:58,815
Not that I think it'll help, but anything I can do...

84
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:03,715
Gotcha. We'll take Goku and move
him to where Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i> is.

85
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:06,425
We should be able to buy
him quite a bit of time there.

86
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:10,865
Tell Goku for me not to overdo it.

87
00:09:16,575 --> 00:09:20,405
Don't overdo it. He's right, you know.

88
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:23,905
This time, not even Goku has a chance.

89
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:27,475
How could history be
turning out this differently?

90
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:31,215
The Artificial Humans weren't
supposed to be this incredibly powerful.

91
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:33,215
And there were only
supposed to be two of them.

92
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,415
How should I know why?

93
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:39,445
At any rate, this time around, this is the reality.

94
00:09:58,615 --> 00:10:00,975
Here, Goku<i>-sa...</i>

95
00:10:32,475 --> 00:10:35,805
A car! We finally found one.

96
00:10:35,845 --> 00:10:39,445
We're fine! Why don't we just keep on flying?

97
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:43,285
There's no reason for us
to hurry. We have the time.

98
00:10:44,195 --> 00:10:46,025
Well, well...

99
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:02,435
You're just pulling my leg.

100
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:05,845
No, it's true. I was shocked.

101
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:15,445
These packages are in the way.

102
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:18,855
Hey, you! What do you think you're doing?!

103
00:12:09,205 --> 00:12:12,675
Well then, we're off.
First stop, Son Goku's home.

104
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:15,475
Before that, I said I wanted some new clothes.

105
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,885
All right, all right.

106
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:25,245
What am I, dreaming?

107
00:12:27,965 --> 00:12:29,585
Could be.

108
00:13:08,335 --> 00:13:11,135
Damn it all!

109
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:27,615
<i>Think I'm going to let this go?</i>

110
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:30,515
<i>No! This isn't over until I make</i>
<i>you Artificial Humans realize...</i>

111
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:34,995
<i>...that I am the strongest warrior in the universe!</i>

112
00:13:57,555 --> 00:14:00,545
Hey, what have we here?!

113
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,525
Hey, boss! There's a girl up here!

114
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:15,125
Hey there, cutie!

115
00:14:15,165 --> 00:14:18,535
Ride along with us, and
we'll have ourselves some fun!

116
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:19,965
You heard the man.

117
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:22,565
Well, maybe we will have a little fun.

118
00:14:37,555 --> 00:14:41,325
They've got a lot of guts to challenge
the Invincible Lords of the Highway!

119
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:42,955
Let's get them!

120
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,565
Scum! You won't make a fool out of me!

121
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:58,935
Say, No. 17, how'd you like
to try some of their clothes?

122
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:02,105
Stop kidding around!
Those ridiculous outfits?!

123
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:03,985
Thought so.

124
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:25,385
Damn you!

125
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,155
So, they're finally giving up?!

126
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:18,945
Damn you!

127
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,955
What?! You want some of this?!

128
00:17:44,975 --> 00:17:48,975
The cops! Guess you guys get to live!

129
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:59,155
Stay where you are!
Don't make any funny moves!

130
00:18:03,965 --> 00:18:05,195
There's no mistake!

131
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:07,525
This is the stolen vehicle, all right!

132
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:08,895
Okay, then.

133
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:11,265
We're taking you in for questioning.

134
00:18:16,145 --> 00:18:19,975
Hey, you, get out! Come out of there!

135
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:27,975
Don't try anything!

136
00:18:33,595 --> 00:18:36,125
Why you! Are you resisting?!

137
00:18:36,165 --> 00:18:37,995
He calls that resisting.

138
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:41,125
You know what, Officer?

139
00:18:41,165 --> 00:18:43,935
If you want to see someone resisting...

140
00:18:43,975 --> 00:18:46,495
Hey, hold it! What are you doing?

141
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:49,975
Doing something like this...

142
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:54,535
...is called resisting.

143
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:04,545
Shall we go?

144
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:28,545
There it is! That's Goku's home!

145
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:40,155
Say, can I ask you something?

146
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:47,965
T-Those Artificial Humans... You're
sure they're all rotten to the core?

147
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:50,635
They're unbelievably cold-blooded.

148
00:19:50,675 --> 00:19:54,965
At least they are in my era. Why do you ask?

149
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:56,735
Oh, yeah, well, I was just thinking,

150
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:59,735
it'd be great for us, you know, if they weren't...

151
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:03,745
I think you're better off not
entertaining such dubious hopes.

152
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:08,185
Y-Yeah, of course, you're right.
I was just thinking, that's all.

153
00:20:11,895 --> 00:20:12,955
See ya!

154
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:16,725
Gohan<i>-chan</i>?!

155
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:19,225
Oh, it's Kuririn<i>-san.</i>

156
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,865
Ow! Ow! Ow!

157
00:20:21,905 --> 00:20:24,095
Nice to see you.

158
00:20:24,135 --> 00:20:26,065
It's Goku's wife.

159
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:28,165
N-Nice to meet you.

160
00:20:28,205 --> 00:20:30,505
Kuririn! You're all right!

161
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:32,535
Thank goodness, we've been worried!

162
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:33,535
How's Goku?!

163
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:36,575
He's okay. He took the
medicine and he's sleeping now.

164
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:40,945
You're the one from the future...

165
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:45,955
I get it! You beat the
Artificial Humans for us, right?

166
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,855
N-No.

167
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:49,925
I'll fill you in on everything later.

168
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:54,095
Right now, we have to hurry and
move to Muten Roshi's place. All of us.

169
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:55,095
What?

170
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:58,095
There are three new, even
more terrifying Artiicial Humans,

171
00:20:58,135 --> 00:21:00,935
and they'll be here any time.

172
00:21:00,975 --> 00:21:03,135
T-This is terrible.

173
00:21:11,585 --> 00:21:14,545
Gently, now! Gently!

174
00:21:14,585 --> 00:21:17,555
So these new Artificial
Humans are all that strong, then?

175
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:22,155
Yeah. And "strong" just doesn't cover it.

176
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:27,565
Now we just have to wait for Gohan.

177
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,795
He took Bulma home, right?

178
00:21:31,535 --> 00:21:33,195
He's back!

179
00:21:33,235 --> 00:21:34,935
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

180
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,135
Huh?

181
00:21:39,545 --> 00:21:41,505
Why is everyone here?

182
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:45,545
Thank goodness! Thank
goodness you came back unhurt!

183
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,515
H-Has something happened?

184
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:51,995
I'll tell you later, hurry and get in the plane.

185
00:22:17,145 --> 00:22:20,515
<i>For the time being, a temporary</i>
<i>evacuation has been accomplished.</i>

186
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:23,715
<i>However, even then, the sound of a new mystery...</i>

187
00:22:23,755 --> 00:22:27,155
<i>...was about to make itself known to Bulma...</i>

188
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:48,675
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

189
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:54,515
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

190
00:22:54,555 --> 00:22:56,885
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

191
00:23:00,355 --> 00:23:05,385
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

192
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:11,895
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

193
00:23:11,935 --> 00:23:16,005
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

194
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:19,505
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

195
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:22,145
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

196
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:29,615
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

197
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:33,755
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

198
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:35,555
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

199
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:39,595
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

200
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:45,265
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

201
00:23:45,305 --> 00:23:47,435
<i>So sorry.</i>

202
00:23:47,475 --> 00:23:52,575
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

203
00:23:55,315 --> 00:24:00,585
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

204
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:14,065
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

205
00:24:14,105 --> 00:24:16,825
<i>Guys, I'm sorry I'm worrying you,</i>

206
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:19,765
<i>but my heart is getting much better.</i>

207
00:24:19,805 --> 00:24:22,105
<i>What did you say, Bulma-san?!</i>
<i>Another time machine,</i>

208
00:24:22,145 --> 00:24:25,335
<i>just like mine, has been discovered?!</i>

209
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:27,445
<i>Who in the world could have come here in it?</i>

210
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:29,575
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

211
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:32,915
<i>"An Ominous Foreboding!</i>
<i>Bulma Unveils a Mystery."</i>

212
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:35,725
<i>What could have happened in the future?</i>

213
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,215
"Next time"
"An Ominous Foreboding!
Bulma Unveils a Mystery"
