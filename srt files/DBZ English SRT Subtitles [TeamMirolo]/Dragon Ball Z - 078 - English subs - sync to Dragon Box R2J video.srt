4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065

<i>Uniting with Nail,</i>

<i>However, Freeza was still</i>
<i>hiding the true depth of his power!</i>

20
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,435
Watch very carefully.

21
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:28,815
This is not something you will see every day!

22
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:33,945
When I attacked the planet
Vegeta, home to the Saiyans,

23
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:38,115
you realize there was utterly
no reason for me to transform.

24
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:45,455
<i>So, the Saiyan's home</i>
<i>planet was destroyed by him?</i>

25
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:50,195
Now then, marvel at this!

26
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:57,075
<i>"A Nightmare Super-Transformation!!</i>
<i>Freeza's Battle Power of One Million."</i>

27
00:04:04,475 --> 00:04:07,245
What kind of transformation is this?
You're making us laugh!

28
00:04:07,285 --> 00:04:11,775
To think that taking that off to become
more nimble is your idea of transforming...

29
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:19,415
Vegeta<i>-san</i>, I am so disappointed in you.

30
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:22,455
And after I looked after you the way I did.

31
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,755
If only you had peaceably submitted to me,

32
00:04:24,795 --> 00:04:28,465
you would not have to
experience this horror now.

33
00:04:28,505 --> 00:04:30,435
What are you babbling about?

34
00:04:30,475 --> 00:04:33,465
I never submitted myself to you!

35
00:04:33,505 --> 00:04:35,005
I was just pretending to submit,

36
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:37,935
all the while waiting for the right
moment to come along, so I could defeat you!

37
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:41,945
Yes, that is one of the
poor habits you Saiyans had.

38
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:44,445
Take your own father...

39
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:48,445
The king of Planet Vegeta was the same way.

40
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:53,425
What's this? You say the occupation
of Planet Tapp is still not complete?

41
00:04:53,465 --> 00:04:58,255
Yes, sir. The Tappan's resistance is
proving tougher than we anticipated.

42
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:00,965
They say it will take another
three days to complete the occupation.

43
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:02,465
Three more days?!

44
00:05:02,505 --> 00:05:04,965
Yes, sir. My humblest apologies.

45
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,765
Why, you! Have you forgotten that we promised
Freeza<i>-sama</i> the planet by tomorrow?!

46
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:10,775
No, I would never do such a thing!

47
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:14,975
However, the full moon on Tapp
will not appear for three more days.

48
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16,485
Be gone.

49
00:05:19,985 --> 00:05:22,455
Be gone! And let nothing remain!

50
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,465
As barbaric as always, I see.

51
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,975
I did not mind if it took another three days.

52
00:05:43,015 --> 00:05:45,985
You've done something unfortunate here.

53
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,445
Nonetheless, I came to speak about your son.

54
00:05:54,485 --> 00:05:57,955
When do you intend to bring him to me?

55
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:00,325
Well, that is...

56
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:08,065
I know! You will please
bring him in three day's time,

57
00:06:08,105 --> 00:06:11,765
along with your announcement of
the successful occupation of Planet Tapp.

58
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,445
You need not worry that I will not pamper him.

59
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:32,485
King Vegeta, are you really going
to deliver the prince to Freeza<i>-sama</i>?

60
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,485
Yeah.

61
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:36,495
But won't you be risking the prince's life?

62
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:38,995
I'm not concerned about
things such as my son's life!

63
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:41,925
What I find unbearable is his attitude!

64
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:45,935
He has the mistaken idea that we
Saiyans are his slaves or something!

65
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:47,435
King Vegeta!

66
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,905
Curse you, Freeza!

67
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:51,935
Someday, we'll teach you a lesson!

68
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:58,915
You really do resemble
your dearly departed father,

69
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:01,445
both in your appearance and in your foolishness.

70
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,945
Foolish, you say?

71
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:07,425
That is right. If your father
had not tried such a foolish stunt,

72
00:07:07,465 --> 00:07:10,625
the Saiyans would have gotten
off without being exterminated.

73
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,965
Listen up, you guys.

74
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:19,465
Freeza is afraid of us Saiyans
ganging up in large groups.

75
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:24,435
If you elite warriors combine your
powers as one, we are certain to defeat him!

76
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:28,435
Let's show him just how strong we Saiyans are!

77
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:42,955
Freeza<i>-sama,</i>

78
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,425
some Saiyans, including the Royal family,

79
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,795
have just arrived and are
requesting an audience with you.

80
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:51,935
Freeza<i>-sama</i>?

81
00:07:51,975 --> 00:07:56,435
Lately, there have been some disquieting
tendencies among the Saiyans, yes?

82
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,465
Yes, sir.

83
00:07:58,475 --> 00:08:01,475
They are indeed becoming quite an eyesore.

84
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,485
They are fools.

85
00:08:11,495 --> 00:08:14,465
Quickly, men! Freeza is in here!

86
00:08:39,015 --> 00:08:40,485
Take this!

87
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:55,395
Zarbon<i>-san</i>, open the door.

88
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:58,895
You will show the Saiyans in.

89
00:08:58,935 --> 00:09:00,105
Yes, sir.

90
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:04,675
A little exercise may be good for me.

91
00:09:07,515 --> 00:09:09,105
Where is Freeza?!

92
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:18,485
I'll kill you, and rule the universe myself!

93
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,985
Are you sure it will be as simple as that?

94
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:25,465
Are your men not trembling with fear even now?

95
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:33,605
Aw, crap.

96
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,455
King Vegeta!

97
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:20,115
Your king has just been defeated,
do you sirs not wish to avenge him?

98
00:10:39,975 --> 00:10:43,605
Was that the best that even Saiyans could do?

99
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:47,445
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, are you uninjured?

100
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:50,345
I did not even need to transform myself.

101
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:53,825
Now then, shall we be off?

102
00:10:57,055 --> 00:11:00,995
We are going to go watch
the fireworks of Planet Vegeta.

103
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,405
How wonderful!

104
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:57,415
Watch this, Zarbon<i>-san</i>, Dodoria<i>-san</i>!

105
00:11:57,455 --> 00:12:00,785
Watch these beautiful fireworks!

106
00:12:13,035 --> 00:12:16,495
I wanted to show it to you, too.

107
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:19,935
The fireworks of Planet Vegeta.

108
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:22,735
What a load of bull! If you
were really afraid of us Saiyans,

109
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:27,945
simply blowing up Planet Vegeta
would be a completely fruitless measure.

110
00:12:27,985 --> 00:12:32,945
I'm right, aren't I? I mean,
you let me survive, after all!

111
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:36,115
<i>Not to mention Kakarrot...</i>

112
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:39,955
That's enough talk out of you.

113
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:44,455
So then, shall I begin the next part?

114
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:48,695
Your dearly departed father never saw this form.

115
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,495
What?!

116
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,315
What's this? What does he think he's doing?

117
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:57,935
Why me? Why am I the only
one that has to go through this?

118
00:13:57,975 --> 00:14:01,135
This isn't funny, for crying out loud.

119
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:13,485
What's this? What's going on?

120
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:39,105
Help me!

121
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,465
What–what's going on here?

122
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:51,975
What?!

123
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:39,065
Impossible! This can't be!

124
00:16:40,465 --> 00:16:42,425
We'll be killed!

125
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:44,465
It's a... nightmare!

126
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:57,475
Watch out, now! In this form,
I won't be as gentle as I was before.

127
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,165
<i>What a ki!</i>

128
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:18,065
What's this? The strength of Freeza's
<i>ki</i> has just increased several times over!

129
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,695
Oh, no!

130
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:21,365
Gohan!

131
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:31,975
Vegeta, what happened to those
high spirits you were in a moment ago?

132
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:36,115
You were spouting off all
sorts of demands, weren't you?

133
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:40,085
Well, I really can't blame you.

134
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:45,295
Not after having been
shown my overwhelming power.

135
00:18:00,985 --> 00:18:02,445
Th-This guy's incredible!

136
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:05,445
Like I said, watch out!

137
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:10,955
You see, I have a lot more power now,
and I might just overdo things a little.

138
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:15,625
Incidentally, my battle power
is now probably over 1,000,000.

139
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:20,965
Wh-What?!

140
00:18:21,005 --> 00:18:22,965
Unbelievable!

141
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:26,135
Not even you could reach that high!

142
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:32,465
If you think I'm lying, I'll show you!

143
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:45,785
Dende!

144
00:18:47,965 --> 00:18:49,625
No!

145
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,485
What's this?!

146
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:25,825
Freeza, you low-life, what have you done?!

147
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:31,475
What is the deal with this planet?!

148
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:46,145
Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

149
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,945
What happened to Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

150
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:50,975
Right here!

151
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:54,955
You– you're bleeding!

152
00:19:54,995 --> 00:19:59,155
It's nothing. I just got
clipped by a flying rock fragment.

153
00:20:02,005 --> 00:20:05,395
You all fled from that more
quickly than might be expected.

154
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:07,905
You have my praise.

155
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:11,375
However, that was just my way of saying hello.

156
00:20:11,415 --> 00:20:14,905
Even a Saiyan could have done that.

157
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:16,905
Why, you!

158
00:20:16,945 --> 00:20:19,945
That's such a pitiful
face you're wearing, Vegeta.

159
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:25,785
I'd guess that you never imagined
I could become this powerful.

160
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:32,955
Now then, which one of
you should I show to Hell first?

161
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,945
I've decided!

162
00:21:43,465 --> 00:21:45,465
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

163
00:21:46,475 --> 00:21:48,135
So... fast!

164
00:22:14,005 --> 00:22:18,465
<i>All too soon, Kuririn is run through by Freeza.</i>

165
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:24,475
<i>Is this the strength of Freeza?</i>

166
00:22:24,515 --> 00:22:27,635
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

167
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:48,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

168
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

169
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

170
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

171
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

172
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,985
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

173
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:19,495
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

174
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

175
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

176
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

177
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

178
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

179
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

180
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

181
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,565
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

183
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:14,045
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

184
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:18,385
<i>Damn. First Kuririn was done in, and now Gohan!</i>

185
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:22,225
<i>It doesn't matter if you're a</i>
<i>Namekian, a Saiyan, or an Earthling,</i>

186
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:25,095
<i>it won't change the fact</i>
<i>that you're going to die.</i>

187
00:24:25,135 --> 00:24:27,055
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

188
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:31,465
<i>"Is This the End!? A Brutally</i>
<i>Transcendent Power Attacks Gohan."</i>

189
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:35,645
<i>I wanted to get married once, too.</i>

190
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:38,275
"Next time"
"Is This the End!? A Brutally
Transcendent Power Attacks Gohan"
