<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,350
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,110
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,740
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,750
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,340
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,260
<i>The sky is clear</i>

00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,090
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,640
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,640
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,640
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,310
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,190
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,660
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,660
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,040
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,250
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,090
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,880
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,180
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,480
I've taken a lot from you.

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,900
Now I don't have any more to do with you.

25
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,940
I won't stand you any more!

26
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,330
<i>Having slain Madoshi Babidi, Majin Boo</i>
<i>has become even more reckless.</i>

27
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,970
Your remaining time is down to 30 minutes.

28
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,350
You better start getting
ready to go back, Goku.

29
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,270
Uranai O-Baba! Only 30 minutes?
Is that all I have left!?

30
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,980
<i>Goku could only remain</i>
<i>on Earth for a brief time.</i>

31
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:48,280
<i>Goku began giving Trunks and Goten</i>
<i>special training to teach them Fusion,</i>

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,370
<i>a new finishing technique!</i>

33
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,460
Carefully watch the angle of your legs!

34
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,330
"Ha!!"

35
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,340
Then you put your fingers together like this!

36
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,670
Again, carefully watch the angle of your legs!

37
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,050
What do we do!? That looks awful!

38
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,930
<i>"See You Later, Everybody!!</i>
<i>Goku Returns to the Other World."</i>

39
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,900
Listen up. The only thing that will
defeat Majin Boo is this Fusion technique!

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,000
You have to learn it perfectly
within the next two days.

41
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,330
Right!

42
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,390
<i>Goku is breathing hard.</i>

43
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,680
<i>This must be due to him using up all his energy</i>

44
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,350
<i>by becoming Super Saiyan 3</i>
<i>during his fight with Boo.</i>

45
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,020
Now then, both of you do that Pose from
a moment ago, and make it symmetrical.

46
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,110
Got it? Okay, give it a try!

47
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,070
What's wrong?

48
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,040
What does symmetrical mean?

49
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,080
Um, how can I explain?

50
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,260
All right! Me and Piccolo will try
doing it for you, so watch closely!

51
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,390
I will!?

52
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,980
Ready? Watch carefully!

53
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,530
Like this, as if being reflected in a mirror...

54
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,580
Both of you move opposite each other.

55
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,160
"Fu–"

56
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,000
"–sion!"

57
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,710
"Ha!!"

58
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,010
W-What is this?

59
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,980
They said they were training,
but is this dance training?

60
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,730
Are they really going to be
able to defeat Majin Boo like that?

61
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,200
All right! Trunks! Goten! You do it!

62
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,200
Right!

63
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,790
Goku, you said you wanted to try
doing this together with Vegeta...

64
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,210
But, even if he were still alive,

65
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,760
I don't think he would
have done this with you.

66
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,170
Why not?

67
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,970
How come?

68
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,260
Uh... n-never mind.

69
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,350
Hey, hey!

70
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,940
Like this?

71
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,520
Right, right! Huh? Goten, the
angle of your arms is a bit low.

72
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,270
Raise them higher.

73
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,950
Right! Now, step to the side...

74
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,070
Fu–

75
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,370
–sion!

76
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,410
Oops!

77
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:25,370
–Ha!
–Hey, hold on, more this way, this way!

78
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,870
Good grief...

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,880
All right! Well then, let's try it a little slower.

80
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,600
Gohan! Gohan!

81
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,350
Chichi, shake it off!

82
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,900
Is she still down from having
heard about Gohan dying? Poor thing!

83
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:56,320
O-Baba! How much time's
Goku-<i>sa</i> got remainin' here on Earth?

84
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,910
It depends on Goku's energy,
but I'd say about 15 minutes or so.

85
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,500
15 minutes!?

86
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,500
Chichi, please come to 'fore then!

87
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,210
Otherwise, you'll miss his leavin' forever!

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,380
Fu–

89
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,550
–sion! Ha!

90
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,390
It's starting to feel right!

91
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,520
All right... Keep going like that!

92
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
I feel terrible! Even as we're here,
Majin Boo is out wreaking havoc,

93
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,530
and continuing to destroy the Earth!

94
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,320
Yeah, even knowing that
we can return everything

95
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,740
back to normal with the Dragon Balls.

96
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,930
Hooray! Hooray!

97
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:07,310
Great! Great! Babidi's all gone!

98
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:13,610
Now there's nobody to order
me around! Great! Great! Yea! Yea!

99
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,490
Now which city should I demolish?

100
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,320
Yahoo!

101
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,300
I'm starting to get sleepy.

102
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,950
What are you doing, you dimwit!?

103
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,870
Why, you...

104
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:15,290
Didn't you hear me!? I'm telling
you to hurry and get out of the way!

105
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,510
Am I cool-looking?

106
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,130
What? Cool-looking, you say?

107
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,550
You punk! Of course you don't look cool!

108
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,760
Haven't you ever looked in a mirror!?

109
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,220
You lousy...

110
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,600
Majin–

111
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:48,070
I-It's Majin Boo!

112
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,180
This is a good place. Think I'll
build my house here and take a nap!

113
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,180
It's too loud, huh? Gonna make things quiet!

114
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,440
Living things, come together!

115
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,670
First, I'll turn everyone into clay!

116
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,840
Smoosh!

117
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,180
Next comes cleaning, cleaning!

118
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,820
Okay, now...!

119
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,730
Fu-sion! Ha!

120
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,690
No, no! Again!

121
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,860
Fu–

122
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,860
–sion!

123
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,280
Ha!

124
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,280
There's still a ways to go, huh?

125
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,280
The two of you ain't matched your breathing.

126
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,870
Goten, are you having fun with this training?

127
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,290
Not at all.

128
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,710
Come on! Snap to it!

129
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,670
R-Right!

130
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,620
Finished!

131
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,760
Looks cool!

132
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,430
Ups-a-daisy!

133
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,620
Here is where I eat food.

134
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,290
Here is the tub.

135
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,880
Heavenly, heavenly!

136
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,880
Pajama-jama-jama,

137
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,880
Pajama-jama-jama, Pa-pa-pa!

138
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:36,930
Pajama, Pa-pa-pa, pajama!

139
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,690
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-
pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa, pa-pa-pa, pajama!

140
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,360
Here is the toilet.

141
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:03,160
Here is where I wash my
face and brush my teeth.

142
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,590
Be sure to brush your teeth often, okay?

143
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,670
Here is the bed.

144
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,860
I slept good! I bet I slept for five seconds.

145
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,780
Now then, he said it would be two
days 'til those strong guys come, right?

146
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,870
It'll be dull until then. All right!

147
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,700
Gonna go destroy cities again!

148
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,620
Away!

149
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:51,630
Okay, once again, from the beginning!
Okay, stretch out your arms!

150
00:14:51,670 --> 00:15:01,680
Go! One-two, one-two, one-two...

151
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,850
What's the matter, Trunks?

152
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,820
Uncle, this technique makes us look bad!

153
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,820
Look bad? I ain't so sure.
Even so, this technique is awesome!

154
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:23,830
The Metamorans that taught it to me got
exceptional strength from doing it, you know!

155
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:30,250
Even so... Never mind that,
Uncle, show us Super Saiyan 3!

156
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:33,670
Earlier, I was gone getting
the Radar, and didn't see it!

157
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,260
I want to see Super Saiyan 3 too.

158
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,010
Rather than learn this cumbersome technique,

159
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,890
maybe we should turn
Super Saiyan 3 instead, shouldn't we?

160
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:49,810
Yeah! Then we'll beat Majin Boo for sure!

161
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,610
That ain't possible.

162
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,240
Unless you merge together with Fusion,
he's not at all an opponent you can beat.

163
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,200
Don't take Boo too lightly!

164
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,620
I-Is that so?

165
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,950
Now, let's continue your training.

166
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:18,220
I give up. All right! Just once,
I'll show you Super Saiyan 3!

167
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,220
Really?

168
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,850
In exchange, you have to train
as hard as you can on Fusion!

169
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,270
Stop, Goku! The time you
can stay on Earth will disappear!

170
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,270
There ain't any time anyway.

171
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,730
Trunks! Goten! Watch closely!

172
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,450
First comes Super Saiyan...

173
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,920
This is beyond Super Saiyan,
or Super Saiyan 2...

174
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,920
And beyond this...

175
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,810
What is it!?

176
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,020
This is Super Saiyan 3.

177
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,190
A-Awesome!

178
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,360
Father!

179
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,580
–U-Uncle!
–Father!

180
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,490
Goku!

181
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm okay, Piccolo!

182
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,010
Okay, you promised.
Continue your Fusion training!

183
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,180
Goku, it's time!

184
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,640
You're going back to the Other World.

185
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,060
Already...?

186
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:37,060
Just now, the time you can
stay on Earth shrank remarkably.

187
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,980
I see. Piccolo, sorry, but the rest is up to you.

188
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,610
Knowing these two, they should
master Fusion before tomorrow's out.

189
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,200
G-Goku...

190
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,120
You're the only one who can
teach them now. I'm counting on you.

191
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,960
You got it.

192
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,040
Trunks! Goten!

193
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,170
You're the only ones that can
beat Majin Boo and save the Earth!

194
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,130
Train hard, now!

195
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,800
Right!

196
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,970
Chichi! Chichi! Wake up, I tell ya! Chichi!

197
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,190
W-Where am I?

198
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:21,270
I'll give ya the details
later, right now, Goku-<i>sa...</i>

199
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:24,150
Goku-<i>sa</i>'s goin' back to the Other World!

200
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,280
G-Goku-<i>sa</i>!?

201
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,580
You've gone to such lengths, it's too
bad you couldn't have taken it easy.

202
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,000
Good-bye, Son-<i>kun.</i>

203
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,170
Goku, "Take care" may sound a
little strange, but take care, okay?

204
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,170
Yeah!

205
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,170
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

206
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,920
Yow-ow-ow!

207
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:53,970
G-Goku-<i>sa</i>, what am I supposed
to do? Gohan's gone and all...

208
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,480
Chichi, don't get all depressed like that!

209
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,980
You've got Goten, don't you?

210
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,570
B-But, what if he gets killed by Majin Boo...?

211
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,400
Don't worry. If they can master
this technique they're doing,

212
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,950
there ain't no way they'll lose!

213
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,950
Once I see Gohan on the
Other Side, I'll tell him you said hello.

214
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,540
Um, I think that Gohan-<i>kun</i> is still alive.

215
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,550
–Why?
–It's nothing, just a hunch.

216
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,880
I know how you feel,
but really, I don't think that's so.

217
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,560
We can tell by his <i>ki.</i>

218
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,180
Still, it'd be nice if he was alive, huh?

219
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,020
Yes...

220
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,600
Well, that's it. Let's go, Goku.

221
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,690
Yeah...

222
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,030
What is it, Goten?

223
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:53,160
I know! You're wantin' your
daddy to give you a hug, huh?

224
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,500
Oh! In that case, you might have
said something sooner! Whoosh!

225
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:08,090
Goten, take care of your mommy for me.

226
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,710
'kay...

227
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,100
Okay, it really is time, Goku!

228
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,930
I know.

229
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,980
See you later, everyone!

230
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:29,570
Uncle! We're going to try hard!

231
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,950
Everyone, take care!

232
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,950
Let's get together again after you die!

233
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,160
That jerk! He would have
to say something so hapless!

234
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:03,480
Gonna destroy more and more!
Gonna kill more and more!

235
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,190
<i>Majin Boo's wild run continues.</i>

236

<i>And, at the furthest reaches of</i>

244
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,340

245

<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>

<i>I've been looking for you, Gohan.</i>

253

255
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,490

00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,700
