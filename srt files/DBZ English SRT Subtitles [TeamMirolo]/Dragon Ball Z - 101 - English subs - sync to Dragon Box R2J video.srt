<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,880
<i>Just as Kaio had figured,</i>

17
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,380
<i>the power of Earth's</i>
<i>Shen Long returns everyone</i>

18
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,050
<i>who had been killed by Freeza to life,</i>

19
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,390
<i>and together with the</i>
<i>return of the Grand Elder</i>

20
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,760
<i>came the return of Planet Namek's Shen Long.</i>

21
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,640
<i>Elsewhere, the great conflict</i>
<i>between Goku and Freeza continues,</i>

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,040
<i>even as the time of Planet Namek's</i>
<i>explosion draws ever closer!</i>

23
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,880
<i>There are now under two minutes remaining</i>
<i>before the explosion of Planet Namek.</i>

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,250
<i>Is there any way Goku can win?</i>

25
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,260
<i>"I'm Staying on This Planet!!</i>
<i>A Final Wish Towards Victory."</i>

26
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,880
You're sure an obstinate one!

27
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,180
All you had to do was watch
silently from the edge of death,

28
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,520
and you wouldn't have
had to taste of its horror,

29
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,190
as you met your fate
together with the planet's.

30
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,190
Those of you that have come
from Earth are far too moronic!

31
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,200
So much so that you forget who
you are by challenging me to battle!

32
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,200
You have also forgotten
yourself in your own conceit!

33
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,870
What?!

34
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,210
Fine, then.

35
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,870
I'll crush you into tiny pieces.

36
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,910
The way I did that Earthling.

37
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,090
The way you did that Earthling?

38
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,220
You mean Kuririn?!

39
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,330
<i>You mean Kuririn</i>?!

40
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,750
Hmph. Unfeeling Saiyans? What a joke!

41
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,230
Grand Elder of Planet Namek,

42
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,260
Namek is very likely to vanish very soon!

43
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,570
The Dragon Balls there
should have one wish remaining.

44
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:26,240
Yes, Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

45
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,580
Please ask the following
of Shen Long immediately:

46
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,250
"Send everyone there
except for Freeza to Earth."

47
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,890
I understand, Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

48
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,930
I am most grateful for your efforts.

49
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,260
However, the wish must
be told directly to Shen Long.

50
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,270
I will contact whoever is closest
and immediately relay the wish.

51
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,940
You can't! Not like that!

52
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,540
Change that wish for me!

53
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,910
Goku, you heard that?

54
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,720
What is this?

55
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,590
Don't make it everyone except Freeza,

56
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,070
change it to everyone
except for Freeza and me!

57
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,740
Goku, I know how you feel, but
for the time being, return to Earth!

58
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,420
If you don't let me settle
this here and now with Freeza,

59
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,220
I will resent you the rest of my life!

60
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,220
Goku!

61
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,560
I'm begging you, Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

62
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,530
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what is the matter?

63
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,570
What is Goku saying?

64
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,590
Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

65
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,580
Kaio<i>-sama...</i> Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

66
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,580
Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

67
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,420
See here, can't you be quiet?!

68
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,590
But Goku...

69
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,530
Quickly, now!

70
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,730
We ain't got any time!

71
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,240
You've got it, Goku, I won't say anything else.

72
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,410
If that's how badly you want this.

73
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,590
Shen Long is over there!

74
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,920
I'm supposed to have been
killed by Freeza. Why am I...?

75
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,560
The one most near is Dende.

76
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,930
Dende, this is the Grand Elder.

77
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,270
G-Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

78
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,240
Then you are all right!
But how in the world–?

79
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,040
I will answer your questions later.

80
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,570
Right now there is
something I would like you to do.

81
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,910
R-Right!

82
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:20,250
Shen Long should be waiting
for a final wish near where you are.

83
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,250
Yes!

84
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,250
As I recall, only two
wishes have been granted so far.

85
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,590
I want you to go right now
and speak the third wish for me.

86
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:34,600
Right! But what shall I...?

87
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,110
The third wish is...

88
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,580
Excepting Freeza and the
Saiyan named Son Goku,

89
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,580
I want all beings relocated to Earth.

90
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,550
Right!

91
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,560
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, thanks a lot!

92
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,920
Freeza! Let's fight!

93
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,690
You pathetic fool.

94
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,860
There is absolutely no chance that you'll win.

95
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,070
The end of this battle is already in sight!

96
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,090
But for Gohan<i>-kun</i>, our
takeoff preparations are all okay.

97
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,690
I wonder if he's really
serious about fighting Freeza!

98
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,370
I wish you would just
bring Son<i>-kun</i> back with you!

99
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,900
Then we could take off right away.

100
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,910
I told him there wasn't any time!

101
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,550
It's working perfectly, Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

102
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,560
Hurry and bring Son<i>-kun</i> with you!

103
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,430
I'm not too wild about going
paired with only Piccolo, after all.

104
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,080
<i>Father...</i>

105
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,720
<i>Where is this place?</i>

106
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,090
<i>Is it getting ready for its destruction?</i>

107
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,760
<i>I'm supposed to have died.</i>
<i>I was killed by Freeza...</i>

108
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:27,570
I don't know why, but I'm alive!

109
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,600
Where's Freeza? Where's Kakarrot?

110
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,940
Over there, dammit!

111
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,170
<i>Freeza, you bastard!</i>

112
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,480
Be sure you return home alive, Goku!

113
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:13,010
Yeah! And that was sure some
idea you came up with, Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

114
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,720
<i>What's that?!</i>

115
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:25,290
<i>So that's the Shen Long of Namek, huh?</i>

116
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,060
Now I can fight without
worrying about anything else.

117
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,230
–Come on, Freeza!!
–What?!

118
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,980
<i>It's the Dragon Balls!</i>

119
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,080
<i>B-But I thought the Dragon Balls</i>
<i>were supposed to have become stones.</i>

120
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,090
This is it!

121
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,260
Wait!

122
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,090
Stay out of my way!

123
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,600
Is that...?!

124
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,640
Dende, it's up to you!

125
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
Please, let him be in time!

126
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,420
Polunga!

127
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:15,640
What keepest thou?
Have you no more wishes?

128
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,970
I do!

129
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,980
Then thou must speak with haste!

130
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,450
Then, the third–final wish!

131
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:44,300
Make me, Freeza, undyingly young!

132
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,630
F-Freeza!

133
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,300
Oh, hell!

134
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,400
Make me, Freeza, undyingly young!

135
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,360
Very well. Understood.

136
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:18,070
I shall then leave these two here,
and move everyone else to Earth.

137
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,080
You rotten brat!

138
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,250
Freeza!!

139
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,430
Vegeta!

140
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:57,070
Kakarrot, you've become
a Super Saiyan after all!

141
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:03,080
E-Even you! Why?!

142
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,750
Why are you alive?!

143
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,750
Take this!

144
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,110
Farewell!

145
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,750
W-Wait!

146
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,070
Looks as though unless
you speak the language here,

147
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,110
you can't get your wish granted, huh?

148
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,110
You even made me shiver there.

149
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,350
Wasn't that the kid I killed before?

150
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,690
The Dragon Balls on Earth were used

151
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,020
to bring everyone that
you guys killed back to life!

152
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,690
What?!

153
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,720
And with the Dragon Balls here...

154
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,030
What wish did that brat get himself granted?!

155
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:35,870
Except for you and me, the whole
group of people that were on this planet

156
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,070
were moved to Earth!

157
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,720
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what has happened?

158
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,730
It has turned out just as I figured.

159
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,700
–All right!
–That's great, huh Yamucha?

160
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,070
It's too early to celebrate.

161
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,400
Why is that?

162
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:11,740
Because Goku has remained
on Planet Namek with Freeza.

163
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,580
T-That can't be!

164
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,260
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

165
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,100
G-Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

166
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,400
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

167
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,700
How could you leave me
all alone like that again?!

168
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,710
I apologize.

169
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,380
Where in the world is this?

170
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,680
It doesn't appear to be
Planet Namek, does it?

171
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,050
I was on the spaceship.

172
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,750
I don't see the spaceship around here.

173
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,440
Y-You're...

174
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,400
Where are we?

175
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,740
A planet named Earth.

176
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,440
What?! Where's Freeza?!

177
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,410
Son!!

178
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,420
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

179
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,720
Gohan!

180
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,060
Piccolo<i>-san</i>! Ah, Dende!

181
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,890
I-Is this a dream?

182
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,730
Ow! It's not a dream!

183
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,400
It looks as though I've returned to life!

184
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,740
And Kuririn<i>-san</i> too?

185
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,740
I don't know.

186
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,410
Yeah, I suppose so.

187
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,080
G-Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

188
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,110
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>?!

189
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:08,690
All of you, this is the planet called Earth.

190
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,030
–Earth?!
–I-It can't be... How?

191
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,630
What has been going on here?

192
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,870
The time when my measure of life runs out

193
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,940
and I am called away is
once again near at hand.

194
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:29,640
However, before I die, I wish to
relate to you what has taken place.

195
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,090
Where did Kakarrot
and Freeza vanish away to?

196
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,360
<i>There's nothing left to do but pray.</i>

197
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,070
<i>Goku should not have any time remaining.</i>

198
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:08,380
The planet has started to contract.

199
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,590
There are probably no more than
two minutes before it explodes.

200
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:18,060
Will you be killed by me first?

201
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,390
Or will the planet explode first?

202
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,900
Either way, death is all that remains for you,

203
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,340
since you cannot survive
in the vacuum of space.

204
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:31,270
Even in the miraculously improbable
event that you were to beat me!

205
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,610
Maybe so. But I've been
waiting for this moment–

206
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,950
the moment when, with just the two of
us, I could fight you as hard as I want to!

207
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,550
Hmph, even at the risk of death, huh?

208
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,090
It seems you want to settle
things with me, Freeza, at any price.

209
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:04,740
A body-blow battle? Very well.

210
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,270
If that's how badly you want to mix it up.

211
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,620
<i>Remaining on Namek as it is</i>
<i>about to become a planet of death,</i>

212
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,620
<i>the utmost brawl is about to unfold between</i>
<i>the only two who remain, Goku and Freeza!</i>

213
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,430
<i>Will a decision be reached</i>
<i>before Planet Namek explodes?</i>

214
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

215
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

216
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,860
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

217
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,360
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

218
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,870
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

219
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

220
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

221
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,120
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

222
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

223
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

224
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

225
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

226
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

227
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,410
<i>So sorry.</i>

228
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

229
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

230
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,240
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

231
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,770
<i>Before Planet Namek explodes,</i>

232
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,070
<i>I swear, I will defeat</i>
<i>Freeza with my own hands!</i>

233
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:24,410
<i>Son, is this the path you've chosen,</i>
<i>in exchange for your own life?</i>

234
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,880
<i>I don't understand it.</i>

235
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,780
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

236
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,120
<i>"Let's Get It On!!</i>
<i>Two Remain on a Vanishing Planet."</i>

237
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,960
<i>There's only a minute left</i>
<i>before Planet Namek is destroyed!</i>

238
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,260
"Next time"
"Let's Get It On!!
Two Remain on a Vanishing Planet"
