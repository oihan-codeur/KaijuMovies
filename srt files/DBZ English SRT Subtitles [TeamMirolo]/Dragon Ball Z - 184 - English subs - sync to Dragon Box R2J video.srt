But you watch, I will make
you angry, no matter what!

21
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,485
Now then, my Cell Juniors,

22
00:03:28,525 --> 00:03:31,615
your opponents are those seven
who are on that rock over there.

23
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:33,615
Do them harm.

24
00:03:33,655 --> 00:03:36,325
If you like, you can kill them. I don't mind.

25
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:42,085
An even greater battle is beginning!

26
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,045

Damn it all!

30
00:04:40,595 --> 00:04:42,935
Dammit!

31
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:44,605
Over here!

32
00:05:33,315 --> 00:05:37,285
Th-The unnamed warriors

34
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:41,575
It is a very intense fight.

35
00:05:41,615 --> 00:05:44,955
I'm not entirely certain what is happening,

36
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:48,165
b-but at any rate, it
appears to be quite dreadful!

37
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:52,465
Mister Satan, what about you?

38
00:05:53,545 --> 00:05:56,005
Your stomachache seems to have subsided.

39
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:00,975
W-W-What are you talking about?!

40
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:04,185
I just haven't been vocal about it!

41
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,725
Oh, is that right?

42
00:06:06,765 --> 00:06:10,685
Because it's me, I can
endure this level of acute pain!

43
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:13,735
A normal person would
have passed out long ago!

44
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:16,525
Oh! Impressive, Mister Satan!

45
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:21,195
Uh, what about your stomachache?

46
00:06:24,405 --> 00:06:27,205
Um, should I go get some medicine?

47
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:29,415
Shut up! You keep quiet!

48
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:11,585
G-Goku!

49
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:22,765
Tenshinhan! Yamucha!

50
00:07:22,805 --> 00:07:26,595
Goku has used up all of
his strength fighting with Cell!

51
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:29,305
Help Goku out!

52
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,695
Yamucha!

53
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,525
Thank you.

54
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:22,275
This is hardly the time
to be expressing gratitude.

Oh? Your <i>ki</i> has started to
swell up ever so slightly, huh?

61
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:18,475
Good. Apparently, you've started to feel angry.

62
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:20,935
Unless you show your true power soon,

63
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:24,485
nothing else is going to mend matters.

64
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,155
Take a good look.

65
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:30,285
Vegeta and Trunks are barely holding their own.

66
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:33,955
And with his strength gone,
Son Goku is at risk, too.

67

00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,665
I'm sorry, everyone...

71
00:11:24,705 --> 00:11:32,135
I-It wasn't... it wasn't supposed to be like this...

72
00:11:32,175 --> 00:11:36,055
<i>E-Everyone is going to get killed...</i>

73
00:11:38,895 --> 00:11:42,525

74

75
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:49,065
<i>I wish I could use that power to defeat Cell!</i>

76
00:11:49,105 --> 00:11:53,405
<i>B-But... I don't know how...</i>

77
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:59,075
<i>I don't know what to do to get</i>
<i>angry enough to release that power!</i>

78
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:21,855
W-What kind of guys are these?

79
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:29,645
Damn...

80
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:03,685
Am I to keep taking
on these runts forever?!

81
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:10,565
To hell with you!!

82
00:14:34,355 --> 00:14:37,775
Those guys just aren't normal.

83
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:40,945
Say, this isn't worth risking our lives over!

84
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:43,325
Those guys aren't human!

85
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:45,125
Y-You're right.

86
00:14:45,165 --> 00:14:48,335
Any more of this would
indeed be too risky, huh?

87
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,665
Let's pull out of here, while we can.

88
00:14:50,705 --> 00:14:54,125
M-Mister Satan, let's run away, too!

89
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:59,135
Absurd! Why should I, the
champion, have to run away?!

90
00:14:59,175 --> 00:15:01,805
Then, we're going to stay here like this?

91
00:15:01,845 --> 00:15:04,975
N-No... We're going to the hospital for a bit,

92
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:08,765
and once my stomachache
is better, we'll return here.

93
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:12,025
All right! With that decided, let's go!

94
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,395
W-Wait!

95
00:15:28,325 --> 00:15:30,875
Please wait!

96
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:41,795
P-Please...

97
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:49,685
Before you pull out, carry
me over to where that child is.

98
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:52,685
He's just a head, but he's talking...!

99
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:55,065
They're monsters, all right!

100
00:15:56,275 --> 00:16:00,365
P-Please... f-for the sake of the Earth...

101
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:02,365
Y-Y-You've got to be kidding!

102
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:05,155
Cell is standing right next to that child!

103
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:06,825
That's right!

104
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:11,375
How can you ask Mister Satan
to go to such a dangerous place?

105
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:15,335
Y-You want to help out a little too, don't you?

106
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:19,385
I-I hear you're the world
champion of combat sports, and all.

107
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,885
M-Mister Satan is the champion of humanity!

108
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:26,385
He doesn't get involved in
fights between you monsters!

109
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,015
Don't be ridiculous!

110
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:31,935
They may be monsters or whatever,
but they are no match for me!

111
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:35,565
I just need to go to the hospital first...

112
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:38,565
Please... Champion...

113
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:51,705
Mister Satan! You don't have
to stand up to that monster!

114
00:16:51,745 --> 00:16:54,545
She's right! Let's hurry up and go!

115
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:56,665
You have to get to a hospital, quickly!

116
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,385
Mister Satan...?

117
00:17:09,425 --> 00:17:12,185
All right. I'll do it.

118
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:20,315
You'd better not! You'll be killed!

119
00:17:20,355 --> 00:17:23,575
Be quiet! Those guys
with names we don't know–

120
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:26,155
and even that child are fighting!

121
00:17:26,195 --> 00:17:30,785
If the champion ran away,
he'd be a laughingstock!

122
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:33,335
Mister Satan...

123
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:36,795
I-I just need to carry
you over near to him, right?

124
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:38,705
Yeah, thanks.

125
00:17:53,185 --> 00:17:57,525
–I-I'm so scared!
–Once you get close enough,
you can just toss me there.

126
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:59,225
R-Really...?

127
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:10,865
S-Stop...!

128
00:18:19,835 --> 00:18:22,795
I'm asking you to stop, aren't I?

129
00:18:25,835 --> 00:18:28,715
<i>Just a little bit further now...</i>

130
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:34,185
All right, Cell Juniors!
That's enough playing around!

131
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:36,855
You can kill them if you like.

132
00:18:52,245 --> 00:18:56,875
<i>Good. A little more... just a little more...</i>

133
00:18:56,915 --> 00:19:00,415
Do it! Kill them!

134
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:03,755
A-All right, here goes...

135
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,555
N-No. 16...

136
00:19:20,315 --> 00:19:21,435
O-Oh, no!

137
00:19:21,475 --> 00:19:24,105
I put too much force into it,
and threw him too far!

138
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:29,775
S-Son Gohan...

139
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:37,625
It is no sin to fight for what is right.

140
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:42,295
There are opponents with
which you cannot talk things out.

141
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:47,675
Set your spirit free to your
anger. I know how it feels.

142
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:52,255
You just can't take it any longer.

143
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:07,565
That's good advice. However, I'm...

144
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:11,615
I'm doing things my way.

145
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:13,995
Gohan...

146
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:19,165
Nature, and the animals that I, too, liked...

147
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:22,665
D-Defend them for me...

148
00:20:24,205 --> 00:20:26,165
I'm counting on you...

149
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:54,275
Nobody asked you, you factory defect!

00:21:58,345 --> 00:22:04,805
<i>It's in my hands! Whoa, whatever it takes,</i>

159
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:09,355
<i>I am going to go beyond myself!</i>

160
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:12,485
<i>At last...</i>
<i>Whoa, I'll gather my strength,</i>

161

<i>And blow this darkness away!</i>

163
00:22:44,055 --> 00:22:48,065
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

164
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:53,905
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

165
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:56,275
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

166
00:22:59,735 --> 00:23:04,745
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

167
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:11,255
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

168
00:23:11,295 --> 00:23:15,375
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

169
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:18,885
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

170
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:21,505
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

171
00:23:23,265 --> 00:23:29,015
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

172
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:33,105
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

173
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,945
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

174
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:38,945
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

175
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:44,615
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

176
00:23:44,655 --> 00:23:46,785
<i>So sorry.</i>

177
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:51,915
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

180
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:16,065
<i>All right, Gohan is finally good and angry!</i>

181
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:18,735
<i>His power is even more awesome than I thought.</i>

182
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:20,865
<i>Impossible! I don't believe it!</i>

183
00:24:20,905 --> 00:24:22,945
<i>We've been having all this</i>
<i>trouble fighting these runts,</i>

184
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:25,195
<i>and he kills them in a single blow!</i>

185
00:24:25,235 --> 00:24:26,905
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>
