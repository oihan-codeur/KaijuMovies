Huh?

00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:33,405
Goku!

22
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,395
Father!

23
00:02:38,975 --> 00:02:41,135
So, you really did survive.

24
00:02:41,175 --> 00:02:44,075
What are you guys doing here?

<i>"My Dad is Vegeta...</i>
<i>Admissions of the Mysterious Youth."</i>

00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:00,555
Son<i>-kun</i>!

27
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:01,925
Father!

28
00:03:01,965 --> 00:03:04,935
–Goku!
–Goku!

29
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,895
How did you guys know I was
going to be arriving here now?

30
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:13,835
This boy here, this boy!
He told us you'd be coming here.

31
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,535
Father, you know this person, right?

32
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,115
Who is he?

33
00:03:23,155 --> 00:03:27,345
You mean you don't
know who he is? Not at all?

34
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:29,685
No, I don't know him at all.

35
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:34,355
This boy knew when you
would return here, Son<i>-kun.</i>

36
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:37,355
Really? That's strange.

37
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:40,295
After Freeza's spaceship discovered mine,

38
00:03:40,335 --> 00:03:44,365
they must have known when I would arrive.

39
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:47,465
Speaking of which, who was it
that defeated Freeza and his men?

40
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:49,365
That was an awesome <i>ki</i>!

41
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:50,375
Piccolo?

42
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:52,005
Or maybe Vegeta?

43
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:54,705
This guy here did Freeza and the others in,

44
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:56,345
and it only took a split second.

45
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,345
Moreover...

46
00:03:57,385 --> 00:04:00,845
He can become a Super
Saiyan, the same as you.

47
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:02,885
A Super Saiyan?!

48
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:09,355
That's incredible, for being so young!

49
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:13,195
And I didn't even know there were
any other Saiyans besides ourselves.

50
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:16,695
There aren't! There are
no other Saiyans besides us!

51
00:04:16,735 --> 00:04:20,235
There's no way there could be.

52
00:04:20,275 --> 00:04:24,705
Well, makes no difference.
Anyhow, you're a Saiyan, right?

53
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:26,675
Of course it makes a difference!

54
00:04:26,715 --> 00:04:28,875
You're taking things as
casually as you always do!

55
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,545
Really?

56
00:04:31,415 --> 00:04:32,885
Son<i>-san...</i>

57
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:34,985
I need to have a word.

58
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,015
–You mean with me?
–Yes.

59
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:39,045
Just the two of us.

60
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:41,725
Gotcha.

61
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:46,025
What's this? You mean it's a secret from us?

62
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:48,055
'Scuse us, guys, be back a minute!

63
00:04:57,075 --> 00:04:59,005
This is far enough.

64
00:04:59,045 --> 00:05:01,075
Come to think of it,
I've forgotten my manners.

65
00:05:01,115 --> 00:05:04,045
Sorry for making you knock
off Freeza and them for me.

66
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,075
Guess I really did go too easy on him.

67
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:10,085
I should have polished him
off for good back on Namek.

68
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,215
Freeza and his men...

69
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:13,585
...were actually supposed to
have been defeated by yourself,

70
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,595
but some kind of time discrepancy
came up, making that impossible.

71
00:05:16,635 --> 00:05:18,555
And so I had little choice but to step in.

72
00:05:18,595 --> 00:05:23,565
Yeah. Freeza's ship was faster
than mine and they passed me up.

73
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,695
He didn't seem at all
sorry about what he'd done,

74
00:05:25,735 --> 00:05:28,065
so I was going to put him away,

75
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:30,075
and then you showed up.

76
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:31,875
There were three hours until you got here,

77
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,575
so of course it was impossible
for you to deal with him.

78
00:05:34,615 --> 00:05:36,045
Oh, not really.

79
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,075
I've gotten myself a new technique.

80
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:39,075
A new technique?

81
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:42,585
Yeah. It's what's known as
"Instantaneous Movement."

82
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,085
Instantaneous Movement?

83
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:47,085
The folks on a planet
called Yardrat taught it to me.

84
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,725
They were some unusual folks.
Not all that powerful,

85
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:52,595
but they did know all kinds of techniques.

86
00:05:52,635 --> 00:05:54,665
I could have moved myself
from inside the spaceship I was in...

87
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:58,995
...to wherever Freeza was in an instant.

88
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:01,065
Is that so?

89
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:05,075
I wasn't aware that you had
learned such a technique, Son<i>-san.</i>

90
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,345
I was certain there was no
way you could have arrived...

91
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:08,715
...without your spaceship for that three hours.

92
00:06:10,115 --> 00:06:14,085
I've changed history for no reason.

93
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,685
On top of that, I only meant
to meet with you, Son<i>-san,</i>

94
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:18,615
but instead I've run
into everyone else as well.

95
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:20,895
History? What are you talking about?

96
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,595
Before I answer, I have something to ask you.

97
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:30,095
Son<i>-san</i> can you, of your own accord,
become a Super Saiyan at will?

98
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,535
Yeah. I couldn't at first,

99
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,065
but I struggled with it and
managed to bring it under control.

100
00:06:36,245 --> 00:06:39,735
Then may I ask you to
turn yourself, here and now?

101
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:43,045
It is my humble request.

102
00:06:43,085 --> 00:06:46,215
What do you suppose
Father and he are talking about?

103
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,395
You got it.

104
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:17,375
What happened to Son<i>-kun</i>? What's the matter?

105
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:19,755
He's turned into a Super Saiyan.

106
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,085
That's what a Super Saiyan is?

107
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:26,685
He's not even fighting, but what a <i>ki</i>!

108
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:32,055
Is this okay?

109
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:34,765
Thank you very much.

110
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:36,535
It's amazing!

111
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:39,935
You look so much like I do as a Super Saiyan.

112
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:42,065
Okay, now what?

113
00:07:42,105 --> 00:07:44,405
I will also become a Super Saiyan.

114
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:01,585
That guy also turned into a Super Saiyan!

115
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,425
What are they planning to do?

116
00:08:05,135 --> 00:08:07,105
Dammit!

117
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:21,075
We really do look alike.

118
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:22,585
Please excuse me.

119
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:39,095
Why is it you did not avoid me?

120
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,095
Your <i>ki</i> was not that of a killer.

121
00:08:41,135 --> 00:08:43,105
I knew you would stop.

122
00:08:44,435 --> 00:08:46,605
I see.

123
00:08:46,645 --> 00:08:48,505
Very well then, this time I will not stop.

124
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:49,665
Do you understand?

125
00:08:49,705 --> 00:08:51,045
Got it.

126
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:27,475
Just as I expected. The stories were true.

127
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:29,505
No, you're even better!

128
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:38,055
This is the sword I used to slice up Freeza.

129
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:42,055
You just weren't trying your hardest.

130
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:45,055
I can put my trust in you.

131
00:09:45,095 --> 00:09:47,565
I will tell you everything.

132
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:50,065
Did you see that?

133
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:52,565
They're incredible!

134
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:55,065
Kakarrot, you rat!

135
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:57,535
<i>He's gotten even better.</i>

136
00:09:57,575 --> 00:10:03,715
Please lock away what I am about
to tell you within your heart alone.

137
00:10:03,755 --> 00:10:06,585
Okay. Feel at ease to tell me anything.

138
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,545
My lips are sealed.

139
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:12,055
This may sound unbelievable
to those of you in this era,

140
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,025
but I've traveled back
from nearly twenty years...

141
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,355
...in the future in a time machine.

142
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:20,265
From the future? Twenty years?

143
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:23,535
Yes. My name is Trunks.

144
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:26,535
If you're wondering how
it is I can have Saiyan blood,

145
00:10:26,575 --> 00:10:30,535
the reason is because I am
the son of Vegeta<i>-san</i> over there.

146
00:10:30,575 --> 00:10:32,535
Vegeta's?!

147
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,945
Are you really Vegeta's son?!

148
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,615
Yes.

149
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:42,545
There's a resemblance!

150
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:44,925
Now that you say so,
there is a resemblance!

151
00:10:48,595 --> 00:10:51,055
He's you're pop, huh?

152
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:54,795
Two years from now, I was born.

153
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:56,525
This is quite a surprise!

154
00:10:56,565 --> 00:11:00,535
However, I didn't travel back in a
time machine just to tell you that.

155
00:11:00,575 --> 00:11:04,805
Son<i>-san</i>, there are important
things I must make you aware of.

156
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:12,545
In roughly three years from this
time, on May 12, at around 10 a.m.,

157
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:16,045
on an island located 9 kilometers
southwest of Metro South,

158
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:18,425
a terrifying pair of villains will appear.

159
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:28,725
They will be monsters, both
possessing a power so great,

160
00:11:28,765 --> 00:11:32,065
it will be unthinkable
that they are of this world.

161
00:11:32,105 --> 00:11:35,065
Who are they? Aliens?

162
00:11:35,105 --> 00:11:37,575
No. They are born of Earth.

163
00:11:37,615 --> 00:11:42,005
They are Artificial Humans,
sometimes called Cyborgs.

164
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:46,785
They were created by a maniacal scientist,
formerly of the Red Ribbon Army,

165
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:48,845
named Doctor Gero.

166
00:11:48,885 --> 00:11:50,725
Red Ribbon Army?!

167
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:15,345
How long are those two planning on talking?

168
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:23,885
Red Ribbon Army?

169
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:26,885
You mean the same
Red Ribbon army I wiped out?

170
00:12:26,925 --> 00:12:28,055
That's right.

171
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:33,395
The army itself was struck
down many years ago by yourself.

172
00:12:33,435 --> 00:12:37,765
However, Doctor Gero survived,
and continued his research.

173
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:14,065
What did he do it for?

174
00:13:14,105 --> 00:13:16,905
I mean, was he after world domination?

175
00:13:16,945 --> 00:13:18,735
No one is really sure,

176
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:22,405
but I think Doctor Gero
was after at least that much.

177
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:27,475
However, those Artificial Humans,
built to be ultimate killing machines...

178
00:13:55,045 --> 00:13:59,175
...also killed their own creator, Doctor Gero.

179
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:03,755
In short, all that remained
were the Artificial Humans,

180
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:08,425
who liked nothing better than
causing death and destruction.

181
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:11,495
As a Super Saiyan, who took
only a moment to beat Freeza,

182
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:13,765
for you to describe them as monsters,

183
00:14:13,805 --> 00:14:15,425
must mean they're pretty tough.

184
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:17,435
Yes.

185
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:22,435
I've stood up to them, but
there's two of them, after all.

186
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:24,935
Even one-on-one, it was all
I could do just to escape them.

187
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:27,375
Hold on, if there's two of them...

188
00:14:27,415 --> 00:14:29,375
Don't you have any allies?

189
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:31,375
No.

190
00:14:31,415 --> 00:14:35,915
Twenty years from now,
I am the only warrior still alive.

191
00:14:37,425 --> 00:14:42,385
In twenty years, I will be
the only warrior to survive!

192
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:44,225
In the battle three years from now,

193
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:47,395
my dad Vegeta, Kuririn<i>-san</i>, Yamucha<i>-san,</i>

194
00:14:47,435 --> 00:14:52,395
Tenshinhan<i>-san</i>, Chaozu<i>-san,</i>
and Piccolo<i>-san</i>, were all killed.

195
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:55,905
Son Gohan<i>-san</i> was just barely able to escape.

196
00:14:55,945 --> 00:15:00,975
Gohan<i>-san</i> served as my master,
and taught me everything I know,

197
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:03,975
up until four years ago, when he, too, was...

198
00:15:04,015 --> 00:15:06,075
As you are already aware of, with Piccolo gone,

199
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:09,415
the Dragon Balls also disappear,

200
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:12,425
so we were unable to
bring anyone back to life.

201
00:15:20,965 --> 00:15:22,725
As a result of the Artificial Humans...

202
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:27,205
...taking so many lives to
amuse themselves over the years,

203
00:15:27,245 --> 00:15:31,435
the future that I come from is a living hell.

204
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:34,945
They're too strong! They're just too strong!

205
00:15:34,985 --> 00:15:37,575
Just a minute. What about me?

206
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:40,615
What happens to me? Am I killed too?

207
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:43,985
You won't even fight.

208
00:15:44,995 --> 00:15:49,455
In a short time, you will become very sick.

209
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:51,465
Soon after, you will pass away.

210
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,695
It will be a viral infection of your heart.

211
00:15:55,735 --> 00:16:00,435
Not even a mighty Super Saiyan
can win against this illness.

212
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:03,935
Oh no, senzu won't have
any effect on the illness either.

213
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,905
Aw, crud, I'm going to die?

214
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:10,215
What a rip-off, I wanted to fight them!

215
00:16:10,255 --> 00:16:11,845
Shoot!

216
00:16:12,485 --> 00:16:15,945
You're really that disappointed
at not being able to fight?

217
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:18,455
Aren't you afraid?

218
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,955
Sure I'm scared, but these
guys are incredibly strong, right?

219
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:23,655
I sure would like to give them a shot!

220
00:16:23,695 --> 00:16:26,965
You certainly are a true Saiyan warrior.

221
00:16:27,005 --> 00:16:30,465
You're exactly how Mom
and Gohan<i>-san</i> described you.

222
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:33,335
We can surely count on you. I'm glad I came!

223
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:38,435
When your symptoms first
appear, please drink this.

224
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,935
What have you got?

225
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:41,745
It's medicine for you.

226
00:16:41,785 --> 00:16:43,575
There is no treatment in this era,

227
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:46,945
but twenty years from now, we have a cure.

228
00:16:46,985 --> 00:16:49,945
That medicine will allow
you to make it through alive.

229
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:52,955
You mean it?! All right!

230
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:56,085
I wish you'd told me that a lot sooner!

231
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:59,095
It really isn't good for me
to be doing this sort of thing.

232
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,465
It changes history.

233
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:03,935
But considering the
history we'll be changing...

234
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:08,435
I believe that you will definitely
manage to do something about all this.

235
00:17:08,475 --> 00:17:12,105
My mom also hopes so, which
allowed her to struggle through...

236
00:17:12,145 --> 00:17:14,975
...and finally complete her time machine.

237
00:17:15,015 --> 00:17:18,945
Hold on! Your mom knows me?

238
00:17:18,985 --> 00:17:21,045
Yes, quite well.

239
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:27,455
And she built a time machine?
Don't tell me! Your mom is...

240
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,085
Yes, right over there.

241
00:17:31,495 --> 00:17:33,595
B-Bulma?!

242
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:37,965
How long are they going
to yap?! This is ticking me off!

243
00:17:38,005 --> 00:17:41,965
Son<i>-kun</i> looks like he was
bowled over by something!

244
00:17:42,005 --> 00:17:44,075
This is the biggest surprise of all!

245
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:47,345
I thought for sure that Bulma
would take up with Yamucha.

246
00:17:47,385 --> 00:17:51,345
But instead, she goes with Vegeta there!

247
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:55,415
Yamucha<i>-san</i> was, well...
something of a playboy,

248
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:57,785
and she got fed up with him
and they split up, I understand.

249
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:01,385
What's wrong?

250
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:04,055
When she did, she saw how
alone my dad seemed, and somehow,

251
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:06,925
before she realized what was happening...

252
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:12,435
However, they never married.
That's just the way my mom is.

253
00:18:12,475 --> 00:18:14,405
Boy, I don't know.

254
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:18,435
But when it comes to that
issue, it sounds just like her.

255
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:23,005
My dad died before
I had any memories of him,

256
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:26,445
so I was quite moved to
finally meet him a little while ago.

257
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:28,945
He's looking over here at something.

258
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:31,615
It looks like he's smiling a little.

259
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:38,455
Now, please be sure to especially
keep this matter a secret, okay?

260
00:18:38,495 --> 00:18:41,095
If you say anything, and the feelings
between the two of them go bad,

261
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:44,935
then my very existence will be erased!

262
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,765
Yeah, I got it, I got it!

263
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:51,935
Well then, I will excuse myself now.

264
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:54,405
I want to return to the future and
reassure my mom as soon as I can.

265
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:57,575
Sure. Tell her I said thanks for saving my life.

266
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:00,945
It'll be nice if we can change the future, huh?

267
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:05,955
Yes. Knowing your strength,
Goku<i>-san</i>, has raised my hopes.

268
00:19:05,995 --> 00:19:07,455
Will we meet again?

269
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:08,925
I don't know.

270
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:11,995
It takes a long time to
gather the energy necessary...

271
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:14,665
...for the time machine to make a round trip.

272
00:19:14,705 --> 00:19:16,925
If I'm still alive after that time has passed,

273
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:19,465
I will definitely come to help out!

274
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:21,965
Three years from now.

275
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:25,435
Be sure you survive.
You've got yourself a good goal.

276
00:19:25,475 --> 00:19:27,575
I'll be training as much as...

277
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,105
...I can the next three
years for the same reason.

278
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:38,115
Hey, he took off out of there!

279
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:43,925
Now what do I do?

280
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,955
How am I supposed to
explain this to everyone?

281
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:49,465
Father!

282
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:52,765
Goku! What did he say?

283
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,795
Um, well, it wasn't all that much.

284
00:19:57,005 --> 00:20:01,445
Start talking. This is an
important matter for all of us, too.

285
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:04,445
Piccolo, you overheard us?

286
00:20:04,485 --> 00:20:08,885
My sense of hearing is a bit
different from the rest of yours.

287
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:11,355
What does he mean, an important matter?

288
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:13,055
Tell us!

289
00:20:13,095 --> 00:20:14,385
Um, you see...

290
00:20:14,425 --> 00:20:18,395
If it's too hard for you to
tell them, I'll do it for you.

291
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:19,895
Yeah, but–

292
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:21,025
Don't worry.

293
00:20:21,065 --> 00:20:24,395
I won't say anything that
will threaten his existence.

294
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:27,065
And we can't afford to let ourselves get killed...

295
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:28,905
...because we didn't put in the due training.

296
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:30,435
–Ki–
–Killed?!

297
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:33,875
<i>Piccolo told everyone what was to happen,</i>

298
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:39,115
<i>while skillfully leaving</i>
<i>Trunks' nature a mystery.</i>

299
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:46,685
<i>As might be expected, no one</i>
<i>was able to conceal their shock.</i>

300
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,725
Isn't this all a little hard to swallow?

301
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:55,395
A time machine?

302
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:59,395
Any of you who don't believe him,
that's fine. Enjoy yourselves.

303
00:20:59,435 --> 00:21:02,935
But I'm going to train,
because I don't want to die.

304
00:21:07,445 --> 00:21:09,075
What's that?!

305
00:21:15,955 --> 00:21:25,255
Dad, you were strong, proud,
stern, and lonesome, just as Mom said.

306
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:27,425
Please don't die.

307
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:30,635
Young Mom, you hang in there too.

308
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:46,785
He vanished!

309
00:21:55,465 --> 00:21:57,325
I'm going to train.

310
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:58,825
Me too.

311
00:21:58,865 --> 00:22:01,425
I'm in too.

312
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:07,135
<i>Dammit, three years from</i>
<i>now I am going to survive!</i>

313
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:17,415
<i>Having delivered the hard truth,</i>
<i>the mysterious young man departed.</i>

314
00:22:17,455 --> 00:22:23,785
<i>Will such a terrible pair</i>
<i>really appear in three years?</i>

315
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:48,645
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

316
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:54,485
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

317
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,855
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

318
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:05,355
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

319
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:11,865
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

320
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:15,965
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

321
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:19,475
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

322
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:22,105
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

323
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:29,615
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

324
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,715
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

325
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:35,525
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

326
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:39,555
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

327
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:45,235
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

328
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,405
<i>So sorry.</i>

329
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:52,535
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

330
00:23:55,285 --> 00:24:00,545
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

331
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:13,795
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

332
00:24:13,835 --> 00:24:16,365
<i>All right, everyone,</i>
<i>let's meet up again in three years.</i>

333
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:18,135
<i>Those of you who are</i>
<i>sure of yourselves, anyhow.</i>

334
00:24:18,175 --> 00:24:20,965
<i>Artificial Humans are apparently</i>
<i>even worse than anything before.</i>

335
00:24:21,005 --> 00:24:25,905
<i>Before that, Kakarrot, tell us</i>
<i>how you survived on Planet Namek!</i>

336
00:24:25,945 --> 00:24:27,905
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

337
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:32,075
<i>"Goku's New Finishing Technique!?</i>
<i>Watch My Instantaneous Movement."</i>

338
00:24:32,115 --> 00:24:35,685
<i>H-Huh? Father disappeared!</i>

339
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:38,245
"Next time"
