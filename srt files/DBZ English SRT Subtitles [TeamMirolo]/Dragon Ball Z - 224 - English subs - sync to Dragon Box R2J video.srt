00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:24,715
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:30,345
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,065
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:41,695
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,705
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,335
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,215
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:03,045
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,635
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:08,635
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,645
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:20,195
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:23,025
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,655
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,655
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:31,035
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:34,205
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,045
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,875
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:46,135
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:55,895 --> 00:02:00,855
<i>From the depths of space come Madoshi</i>
<i>Babidi and Dabura, King of the Demon Realm.</i>

24
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:09,405
<i>Their goal is to gather the greatest energy in</i>
<i>the world, and revive the sealed-up Majin Boo.</i>

25
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,535
<i>In order to return Kuririn and Piccolo,</i>

26
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:14,035
<i>who had been turned</i>
<i>to stone, back to normal,</i>

27
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:17,075
<i>Goku and the others made</i>
<i>their way inside Babidi's spaceship.</i>

28
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:20,875
<i>Within the spaceship</i>
<i>Babidi's henchmen assault</i>

29
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:24,045
<i>Goku and the others one after another!</i>

30
00:02:26,085 --> 00:02:31,305
<i>At Stage 1, Vegeta overwhelmed Puiupi.</i>

31
00:02:51,445 --> 00:02:55,865
<i>At Stage 2, Goku rips through Maju Yakon!</i>

32
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:03,415
Impossible!

33
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:08,425
These aren't your ordinary guys after all!

34
00:03:13,305 --> 00:03:17,765
I will go to Stage 3 for you!

35
00:03:17,805 --> 00:03:20,975
Come three thousand kili,
come four thousand kili,

36
00:03:21,015 --> 00:03:26,815
there does not exist a man in all
the world with greater power than I!

37
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:34,695
<i>"A Great Miscalculation!!</i>
<i>Satan vs. Three Super-Warriors!?"</i>

38
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:49,965
I wonder just what kind of
guy is going to come out next.

39
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:53,765
Gohan, it's your turn now.

40
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:56,805
Goku-<i>san</i>, this is not a game.

41
00:03:56,845 --> 00:04:02,475
Babidi only selects the very strongest
henchmen from the far corners of the universe!

42
00:04:02,515 --> 00:04:04,355
It is fine that we have
won up until now and all,

43
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:07,855
but from now on, how
about we all fight together?

44
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:14,825
Ah, don't worry about it, Kaioshin-<i>sama.</i>

45
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:20,285
Besides, it wouldn't be fair, would it?

46
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:21,875
Unfair?

47
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:28,175
Yeah! If only me and Vegeta get to fight alone,
while Gohan has to fight with everyone else...

48
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:32,845
He's right! Kaioshin-<i>sama,</i>
please, leave this up to me.

49
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:48,235
Okay, Dabura. Go!

50
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:53,405
They will surely fall at my hand!

51
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:58,865
Oh? Dabura-<i>sama</i>, where are you going?
The lift to the Stages is this way.

52
00:04:58,905 --> 00:05:01,575
He's all right how he is.

53
00:05:03,535 --> 00:05:06,125
Th-The meditation chamber?

54
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:17,055
I get it. Dabura-<i>sama</i> is going
to heighten his <i>ki</i> before fighting.

55
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:28,895
We absolutely must not open
that door until Dabura says it's okay.

56
00:05:28,935 --> 00:05:30,395
Right!

57
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:34,405
He's sure set his mind to it!

58
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:40,365
If he goes all out, it will be a simple
matter for him to beat all three of them.

59
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:48,255
It's taking too long. How long
are they going to make me wait?

60
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:50,085
Don't be so impatient.

61
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:54,465
They're surely getting a
first-rate warrior ready for you.

62
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:59,095
By the way, I wonder what's
happening at the Tenkaichi Tournament.

63
00:05:59,135 --> 00:06:01,055
Good question.

64
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,895
All of us pulled out of there together.

65
00:06:03,935 --> 00:06:06,265
Hmph, rather than going
up against the trivial scum

66
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:08,435
that pass for opponents in a place like this,

67
00:06:08,475 --> 00:06:12,655
I wanted to fight you in
the Tenkaichi Tournament!

68
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:16,655
I was looking forward to
fighting against Father myself.

69
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:18,575
Same goes for me.

70
00:06:18,615 --> 00:06:21,455
I wonder if No. 18-<i>san</i> is doing well.

71
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:25,455
<i>These people... revel in battle...</i>

72
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:28,955
<i>The Saiyans really do love to fight.</i>

73
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:34,965
Hey! What's going on?!

74
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:38,795
–How long are you going to make us wait?!
–Hurry and start the fights again!

75
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:48,315
Oh, what's goin' on?

76
00:06:48,355 --> 00:06:50,435
Are they fixin' to start again?

77
00:06:50,475 --> 00:06:55,355
Not yet. It doesn't look like
Goku and the others are back yet.

78
00:06:55,395 --> 00:06:58,655
Really, where has Goku-<i>sa</i> gone off to?

79
00:06:58,695 --> 00:07:01,995
Hmm, it appears as though
something is happening.

80
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:07,035
There are large <i>ki</i>
gathered in a distant location.

81
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:14,795
They haven't come back now in nearly
in hour, surely they must be disqualified.

82
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:18,345
But with only five others remaining...

83
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:20,175
This is a problem, all right.

84
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:23,675
"Martial"

85
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:29,055
What, everyone's together already?

86
00:07:29,095 --> 00:07:30,855
It's a good thing we got back in time.

87
00:07:30,895 --> 00:07:36,025
Hmph, those guys who left
have done so in fear of Satan.

88
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,735
In that sense,

89
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:42,865
it's fair to say that you who
have remained have true courage.

90
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:46,495
W-We are greatly honored, Mister Satan!

91
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:48,495
<i>Speak for yourself.</i>

92
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:51,035
Oh, I know!

93
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:57,545
–Oh, it's Mister Satan!
–Mister Satan!

94
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:06,385
Satan! Satan! Satan!

95
00:08:06,425 --> 00:08:08,515
Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen!

96
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:12,605
There can be no problem as
long as I remain here! Mister Satan!

97
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:17,935
Didn't you come here to see my strength?!

98
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:20,865
That's right, Mister Satan!

99
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:25,365
Way to go! You said it!
Show us your elegant techniques!

100
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:32,875
Pops is at it again.

101
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:35,915
Really. He never learns.

102
00:08:35,955 --> 00:08:41,465
What do you think, guys?
I, Mister Satan, have a good idea.

103
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:44,925
Oh, what is it, Mister Satan?

104
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:47,305
A Battle Royale.

105
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,385
Battle Royale?!

106
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:54,395
Yeah. Disqualify those spineless
guys who have run off right now,

107
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:59,235
so the courageous five of us who
remain can all fight together in the ring.

108
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:03,235
No one will get excited over a
tournament with only five of us, right?

109
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:08,405
Having a Battle Royale
will be a smash! A smash!!

110
00:09:08,445 --> 00:09:10,415
I-I see!

111
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:14,165
Clever as always, Mister
Satan! That's a great idea!

112
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,415
However...

113
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:20,295
Mister Satan, in a Battle Royale...

114
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:21,635
W-What is it?

115
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:25,465
Do you have some kind of objection
to an idea from Mister Satan?

116
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:26,845
N-No, it's...

117
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:31,265
Fine. If that's the case,
I'll just head on home.

118
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:35,435
N-No, not at all. It is a fantastic idea.

119
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,815
Good, it's settled. Make the announcement.

120
00:09:37,855 --> 00:09:39,275
Right!

121
00:09:39,315 --> 00:09:43,275
Ladies and gentlemen, we
are terribly sorry for the delay.

122
00:09:43,315 --> 00:09:46,325
It has just been decided,
at Mister Satan's proposal,

123
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:51,785
to hold a Battle Royale with
the remaining five contestants!

124
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:54,035
All five will fight within the ring,

125
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:58,205
and whoever remains at
the end will be the victor.

126
00:09:59,415 --> 00:10:02,215
Way to go! That's our Mister Satan!

127
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:04,715
You said it!

128
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:10,675
Wow, a Battle Royale. As might
be expected of Mister Satan.

129
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:13,345
I greatly admire you making
such a courageous statement.

130
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:15,355
Hm? Courageous?

131
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:17,515
That's right, Mister Satan!

132
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:21,235
After all, as the anticipated
winner, in a Battle Royale,

133
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:25,905
the other four will first come at you en masse.

134
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:30,745
If I were to be worried over such a thing,

135
00:10:30,785 --> 00:10:33,825
I would not be able to
call myself a true Champion.

136
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:38,495
Indeed! Mister Satan, you
truly are a great Champion!

137
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:40,745
Right, everyone?

138
00:10:42,085 --> 00:10:44,375
<i>Oh, hell...</i>

139
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:46,885
Battle Royale, he says.

140
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:51,215
I wonder if it'll be startin' before
Goku-<i>sa</i> and Gohan-<i>chan</i> come back.

141
00:10:51,255 --> 00:10:54,765
Hmm, we won't be able to help it if it does.

142
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:59,185
In that case, we won't be
earnin' any prize money at all!

143
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:02,355
Our family budget! We're broke!

144
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:06,775
So then, let us now
introduce the five contestants

145
00:11:06,815 --> 00:11:10,195
who will be appearing in the Battle Royale!

146
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:14,325
First, as you all know,
the Champion Mister Satan!

147
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:19,575
<i>I'm going to artfully score this one!</i>

148
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:27,425
Satan! Satan! Satan!

149
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,935
To continue, the only
female contestant this time,

150
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:39,265
the oddly-named Contestant No. 18!

151
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:42,775
Oh, you cute chick, hang in there!

152
00:11:42,815 --> 00:11:45,395
No. 18!

153
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:46,775
Good luck!

154
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:50,115
Win, Mommy!

155
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,655
And, defeated during the first
round in the last tournament,

156
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:59,205
Contestant Mighty Mask!

157
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:04,415
Oh, that's us. All right,
let's make this look smooth!

158
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:06,255
Yeah!

159
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:16,305
Don't overdo it, Mighty Mask!

160
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:19,095
Further, defeated in the second
round in the last tournament,

161
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:21,395
Contestant Killa!

162
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,435
Killa, get out of there!

163
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:27,485
Finally, he's quite popular with the ladies...

164
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:29,815
unfortunately defeated last tournament by

165
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:32,445
Mister Satan in the final round,

166
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:35,285
Contestant Jewel!

167
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:38,285
You're so handsome, Jewel!

168
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:42,575
That's it! These five contestants
will compete in the Battle Royale!

169
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:55,675
Well, here we go!

170
00:12:55,715 --> 00:12:58,845
Let's win the Adult Division as well, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

171
00:12:58,885 --> 00:12:59,845
Yeah!

172
00:12:59,885 --> 00:13:08,105
Who among these five contestants
will it be that attains victory?!

173
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,715
Hey, why don't we both send

174
00:13:28,755 --> 00:13:32,385
Mister Satan-<i>sama</i> to a ringout loss first, eh?

175
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:36,885
Don't bother me. That guy doesn't matter.

176
00:13:36,925 --> 00:13:40,515
The only real threat is No. 18-<i>san</i>, yeah?

177
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:41,265
Yeah.

178
00:13:41,305 --> 00:13:46,225
W-What the... He's got a
strange way of speaking.

179
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:50,605
Bonjour, my lovely princess.

180
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:56,405
I cannot bear that a lady such
as yourself should have to fight.

181
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:57,405
What do you say?

182
00:13:57,445 --> 00:14:01,405
After the match, just the two of
us could get something to eat, or...

183
00:14:01,445 --> 00:14:03,955
Get lost, you eyesore!

184
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:07,415
W-What did you say?!

185
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:09,205
So then, the final round
will have no time limit!

186
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:16,505
Let us have this five-man
Battle Royale begin at once!

187
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:37,815
<i>I-If you're coming, then come on!</i>
<i>I'll take you! Well, bring it on!</i>

188
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:44,785
<i>That woman! How dare she</i>
<i>refuse my explicit invitation!</i>

189
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:46,625
<i>Rotten Mighty Mask!</i>

190
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:52,375
<i>When did you start having</i>
<i>such a sassy mouth? Damn you!</i>

191
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:58,505
Begin the match!

192
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:33,625
Oh, what is this?

193
00:15:33,665 --> 00:15:34,965
Very early into the match,

194
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:38,215
Contestant Jewel and Contestant
Killa have both dropped out!

195
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:41,845
That lady has a cute face, and she's incredible!

196
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:44,675
Contestant Mighty Mask is pretty good too!

197
00:15:44,715 --> 00:15:48,685
Yea! Mommy, nice going!

198
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:52,685
Stick it to 'em, No. 18! Attaway!

199
00:15:52,725 --> 00:15:55,395
Mommy, nice work!

200
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:58,405
<i>H-How lucky!</i>

201
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:03,695
<i>I don't know how, but two of</i>
<i>those dismal characters are out of it!</i>

202
00:16:03,735 --> 00:16:07,705
<i>All that's left are those two lowlifes!</i>

203
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:11,535
V-Victory is mine!

204
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:15,545
<i>That strange long-torsoed</i>
<i>creep... he's no slouch!</i>

205
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:19,755
<i>Those short arms have greater</i>
<i>punching power than I would have thought.</i>

206
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:21,595
Stay sharp, Goten.

207
00:16:21,635 --> 00:16:23,215
They say Kuririn-<i>san</i>'s wife

208
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:26,225
used to be stronger than our
papas were a long time ago.

209
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,765
Yeah, got it!

210
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:33,605
Come on, both of you!
I'll take you both out at once!

211
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:35,185
Just ignore him.

212
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:36,815
Yeah.

213
00:16:47,245 --> 00:16:50,115
And so, three contestants remain!

214
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:52,915
Contestant Mighty Mask!

215
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,545
Contestant No. 18!

216
00:16:56,585 --> 00:17:00,005
And the Champion, Contestant Mister Satan!

217
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:07,135
Who among these three
will remain and be victorious?!

218
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:11,095
<i>My victory is all but assured!</i>

219
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:16,735
<i>All I have to do is settle it all</i>
<i>while looking cool! That's it!</i>

220
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,315
<i>First, I'll defeat that masked goon with moves</i>

221
00:17:19,355 --> 00:17:21,605
<i>far more flamboyant than they need to be!</i>

222
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:33,585
<i>Then, as that cute girl cowers at my strength,</i>

223
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:39,335
<i>I'll tenderly escort her like a</i>
<i>gentleman to a ringout loss!</i>

224
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:47,885
<i>Both the cute girl and the</i>
<i>spectators will be captivated by it all!</i>

225
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:54,515
Oh, Mister Satan!

226
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:57,145
He is already proclaiming victory!

227
00:17:57,185 --> 00:18:03,485
<i>Magnificent! That was absolutely magnificent!</i>

228
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:05,115
What is he, stupid?

229
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:07,485
Just let him be!

230
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:12,665
Okay, then! You, masked goon!
You will be the first to fall!

231
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:17,705
Forgive me, but there is no
sentiment in the world of fighting!

232
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:24,715
All right, our opponent is
No. 18-<i>san</i>! Got that, Goten?

233
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,255
Okay!

234
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:46,195
She's strong, all right.

235
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,865
Fight back!

236
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:52,785
I know! Here goes!

237
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:00,875
They're good!

238
00:19:00,915 --> 00:19:02,505
Incredible!

239
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:07,925
If Goku-<i>sa</i> isn't fightin',
we'll cheer for No. 18 instead.

240
00:19:07,965 --> 00:19:11,135
Hang in there, No. 18-<i>san</i>!

241
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,925
Mommy, hang tough!

242
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:17,305
<i>Hmm?</i>

243
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:22,895
<i>Mm? Can it be?</i>

244
00:19:22,935 --> 00:19:25,525
Idiot, not that way! Right! Right!

245
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,815
Easy for you to say!

246
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:33,615
Oh no!

247
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,075
We're going to lose!

248
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:38,615
Okay, then!

249
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,545
They're flying!

250
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:46,755
The two of them are flying through the air!

251
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,785
Just what is going on here?

252
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:55,825
That does it, let's break through here!

253
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:57,455
You must not do such a thing!

254
00:20:57,495 --> 00:20:58,995
We can't just wait here forever!

255
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:03,495
B-But you can't just break it!

256
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:08,965
If we irritate them for no reason,
it is instead likely to place us in danger!

257
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:11,045
They're getting impatient!

258
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:12,885
Is Dabura ready yet?

259
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:16,885
Sir, he's still in the meditation chamber.

260
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:22,395
Good, good! Dabura, raise
that <i>ki</i> even higher! More, more!

261
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:36,735
<i>Dabura, king of the Demon Realm,</i>

262
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:40,325
<i>has entered the meditation chamber</i>
<i>to heighten his ki before doing battle.</i>

263
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:57,135
<i>Gohan eagerly looks forward to his attack!</i>

264
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:05,105
This is hard to fight in!

265
00:22:05,145 --> 00:22:09,565
Elsewhere, who will it be that dominates
the Tenkaichi Tournament's Battle Royale?

266
00:22:09,605 --> 00:22:13,525
No. 18? Mighty Mask?

267
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:17,075
Or for that matter, Mister Satan?

268
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:39,005
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

269
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:45,595
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

270
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:56,155
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

271
00:22:56,195 --> 00:23:02,285
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

272
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:09,295
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

273
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:14,665
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

274
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:18,505
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

275
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:27,605
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

276
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:29,145
<i>Even now?</i>

277
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:36,775
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

278
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:42,155
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

279
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:48,665
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

280
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:58,675
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

281
00:24:14,145 --> 00:24:16,065
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

282
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:19,275
<i>Hey, now Goten and Trunks,</i>
<i>are you sure it's all right</i>

283
00:24:19,315 --> 00:24:22,655
<i>to be fighting No. 18 in that strange outfit?</i>

284
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:26,285
<i>This is no laughing matter.</i>
<i>Those kids have incredible attack power!</i>

285
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:29,245
<i>This is bad. I have to finish this fight now!</i>

286
00:24:29,285 --> 00:24:31,455
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

287
00:24:31,495 --> 00:24:34,795
<i>"Such Strong Kids!! No. 18's Close Fight!?"</i>

288
00:24:34,835 --> 00:24:38,715
<i>Wow, way to go! Amazing, both of you!</i>

289
00:24:38,755 --> 00:24:39,795
"Next time"
"Such Strong Kids!! No. 18's Close Fight!?"
