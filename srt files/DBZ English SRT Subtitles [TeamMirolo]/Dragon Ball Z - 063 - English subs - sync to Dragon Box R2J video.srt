<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:24,785
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,745
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:08,225
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,735
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12

<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:05,215
<i>At length, the seven Dragon Balls</i>

17
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:08,025
<i>had fallen into the hands</i>
<i>of the Ginyu Special Corps.</i>

18
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:18,165
I'll take the Dragon Balls to Freeza<i>-sama.</i>
You guys take care of the rest on your own.

19
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,005
Yeah, you're the best!

20
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:32,305
<i>Gohan, Kuririn and Vegeta had teamed up</i>
<i>in order to defeat the evil emperor Freeza...</i>

21
00:02:38,695 --> 00:02:43,065
Okay, Ghurd, go ahead and
take care of those two runts first.

22
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:45,665
All right...

23
00:02:50,805 --> 00:02:57,365
<i>"Super-Magic or Just a Trick!?</i>
<i>Mr. Ghurd is Angry!"</i>

24
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:17,595
A leadoff attack, huh? Ha!
Well, I doubt it will do any good.

25
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:24,235
Gohan!

26
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:25,705
Right!

27
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:36,175
Fools!

28
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,585
Stop!!

29
00:03:47,465 --> 00:03:49,055
<i>You brats!</i>

30
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:51,695
<i>T-They're not there!</i>

31
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:53,295
<i>W-Where are they?!</i>

32
00:03:57,775 --> 00:04:00,735
<i>There they are! All the way over there!</i>

33
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:03,605
<i>Did they move in that one instant?</i>

34
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:10,775
<i>Dammit, I can't hold my breath any longer...</i>

35
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:31,335
Those tiny bugs are
better than we thought, huh?

36
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,835
Their rating on my Scouter...

37
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:41,605
It's a rare species that is able to change
their battle power without transforming.

38
00:04:41,645 --> 00:04:44,975
You've got some nice friends there, Vegeta<i>-chan</i>!

39
00:04:45,015 --> 00:04:49,045
Those guys' speed and
power is incomparably better

40
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:52,115
than the last time we fought. But still...

41
00:04:52,155 --> 00:04:53,985
Incredible!

42
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:56,795
You've increased your destructive power
several steps over what it was before, Gohan!

43
00:04:56,835 --> 00:05:01,125
That's all thanks to having
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> unleash my power!

44
00:05:01,165 --> 00:05:04,605
But that guy fled all the way over there.

45
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:11,135
I'm sure he must have
stopped time again. Let's go, Gohan!

46
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:11,805
Right!

47
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,775
Oh! They vanished!

48
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:37,165
Stop!!

49
00:05:41,205 --> 00:05:43,045
<i>They're already here?!</i>

50
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:48,635
<i>W-Wait, there's no need to run away.</i>

51
00:05:49,655 --> 00:05:53,215
<i>All right, I'll start with</i>
<i>that pipsqueak over there.</i>

52
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,165
Oh, crap!

53
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:09,695
Over there!

54
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:17,565
<i>Kamehame-Ha!!</i>

55
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,985
Oh, man, we almost had him!

56
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:31,215
What are we going to do with Ghurd?
He's having trouble with them.

57
00:06:31,255 --> 00:06:34,555
At this rate, we're going
to have to redo our bet.

58
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:39,725
All right, I'll bet this bar of chocolate
that he finishes it in the next minute.

59
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,865
Okay, I'm in.

60
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:51,805
Damn it! Attacking while keeping time
stopped consumes energy too briskly!

61
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:03,515
I don't know what's going on!

62
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,885
Kuririn and Gohan took the
Dragon Ball they worked so hard to get,

63
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:11,095
and flew away with it!
And Vegeta was with them!

64
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:14,765
What? Vegeta was with them, you say?

65
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:19,765
What on earth does that mean?

66
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,265
<i>If I knew that, I wouldn't be</i>
<i>letting it get to me, would I?</i>

67
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:25,805
<i>I can't stand anything</i>
<i>that's been happening lately.</i>

68
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:33,115
So you say, but didn't your space
capsule get all busted up? Whoops...

69
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:35,585
There's no way you can come home, is there?

70
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:41,125
But then, it's been six days
since Goku took off from here,

71
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:43,685
so he should be arriving pretty soon.

72
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,265
Huh? I can't hear you very well!

73
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:52,595
I know!

74
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:57,665
Really! What is everyone thinking,
tossing a lady aside like this?!

75
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:03,515
<i>Son-kun, hurry and get here.</i>

76
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:39,115
Look, Gohan! Every time he
stops time, he gets more worn out!

77
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:42,145
All right, let's keep attacking him like this!

78
00:08:42,185 --> 00:08:43,175
Right!

79
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,865
S-Stop!!

80
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:13,445
<i>I-It's no use! I don't have enough energy!</i>

81
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,285
<i>All right...</i>

82
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:20,385
<i>I think I'll go hide</i>
<i>somewhere and rest for a bit.</i>

83
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:24,025
<i>Let's see, let's see...</i>

84
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,025
<i>Behind that rock!</i>

85
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:51,745
He's gone!

86
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:08,835
Over there!

87
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:13,235
How did they know I was here?!

88
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:16,915
S-S-Stop–

89
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,905
Hey, Ghurd!

90
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:44,935
This is disgraceful! You're going to
bring shame upon the Ginyu Special Corps!

91
00:10:45,545 --> 00:10:47,505
Ghurd, you dummy!

92
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,505
If you get yourself beaten by those pipsqueaks,

93
00:10:49,545 --> 00:10:52,115
I'm not going to play with you anymore!

94
00:10:52,155 --> 00:10:55,615
You'll have to take your
3 o'clock snack separately, too!

95
00:10:57,695 --> 00:11:00,825
I-I just got a little bit careless!

96
00:11:00,865 --> 00:11:03,955
I'm going to put these maggots away right now!

97
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:07,625
All right, now's our chance!
Let's charge him, Gohan!

98
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,065
Right!

99
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,335
T-They're coming again!

100
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:19,175
All right, if that's how they
want it, I'll use my trump card!

101
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:42,025
What is this?

102
00:11:42,065 --> 00:11:44,335
My body won't move!

103
00:11:47,775 --> 00:11:49,235
It's my paralysis technique!

104
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:52,875
No matter how hard you
struggle, you can't move!

105
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,215
Dammit!

106
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:16,295
I can't move!

107
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:22,935
What happened to all
that energy you had earlier?

108
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,895
Looks like Ghurd is getting pretty anxious.

109
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:47,195
He's using his paralysis technique,
which he doesn't show off that often.

110
00:12:47,235 --> 00:12:49,965
And against those two
sawed-off little bugs, too.

111
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:52,665
Hey, ReaCoom, the chocolate.

112
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:58,475
That bet you just made.
One minute has long passed.

113
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:03,145
All right. Ghurd, you piece of crap!

114
00:13:14,595 --> 00:13:20,125
T-Those idiots! After I told them
to watch out for his supernatural powers,

115
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,605
they go launching a frontal assault.

116
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:31,105
I'm going to get you good for all
the embarrassment you've caused me.

117
00:13:50,965 --> 00:13:52,925
Way to go, hand power!

118
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,095
Get them! Get them!

119
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:55,725
No need to hold back!

120
00:14:09,145 --> 00:14:11,485
Your flesh is so soft, huh?

121
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,485
All right, now it's time
for the 100-blow punishment.

122
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:23,995
I'm going to hit you a hundred times!

123
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:26,965
1... 2... 3... 4...

124
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:30,525
5... 6... 7... 8... 9...

125
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:38,135
15... 16... 17... 18...

126
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:39,575
G-Gohan!

127
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:50,485
I'll do it to you, too, just to be fair.

128
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:53,225
Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

129
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,795
You give me my due!

130
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,905
Hey, Ghurd, how long are
you going to keep this up?

131
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,075
You're holding up the next fight!

132
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:16,405
Hurry up and finish them off!

133
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:19,385
Okay... let's see...

134
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,645
All right...

135
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,125
This tree will do.

136
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:50,475
Hey, you guys! I'm going to skewer you!

137
00:15:50,515 --> 00:15:53,355
You might be good if
I cooked you up and ate you!

138
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:58,995
Yeah, I bet you'd like to escape, huh?

139
00:16:05,195 --> 00:16:08,465
What's the matter? If you don't run away soon,

140
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:10,935
this huge skewer is going to run you through!

141
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:19,315
F-Father! Uncle Piccolo!

142
00:16:32,995 --> 00:16:34,355
<i>Gohan!</i>

143
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:48,975
<i>G-Gohan is in danger!</i>

144
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:59,445
<i>Piccolo, are you sensing</i>
<i>the ki on faraway Planet Namek?</i>

145
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:04,655
<i>Still, there's nothing that you</i>
<i>can do with your power as it is now,</i>

146
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:31,915
Piccolo!

147
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:37,285
I can't eat with this knife!
[can't eat: <i>taberarenai-fu</i>; knife: <i>naifu</i>]

148
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:39,525
Yeah!

149
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:55,865
Can't you move? You poor things.

150
00:17:55,905 --> 00:18:00,405
All right, I'll take care of the kid in
the yellow outfit first with this thing,

151
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:03,415
and then I'll use a different
supernatural power on the other one!

152
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:10,855
G-Gohan, can you do anything?

153
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:15,455
I-It's no use! My nerves are all paralyzed!

154
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,655
Here goes!

155
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:32,835
Our constraints have been released!

156
00:18:35,185 --> 00:18:36,105
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

157
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:37,015
Gohan!

158
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,825
T-That was dirty, Vegeta!

159
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:07,975
T-This was supposed to be a
fight between me and those kids...

160
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:12,845
That's something that you
guys decided for yourselves.

161
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:15,845
You think there's such a
thing as fighting dirty in a war?

162
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:22,255
T-To think that I would be done in by a
lowbrow monkey bastard Saiyan like you...

163
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:24,425
It's infuriating...

164
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:28,065
Hmph. You're the <i>last</i>
person I want to hear that from.

165
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,175
Who would have thought
we'd ever be saved by you?

166
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,345
Thanks.

167
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:47,885
Don't get me wrong.

168
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:51,155
Do you think I deliberately rescued you?

169
00:19:53,255 --> 00:19:58,065
I just had the perfect chance to kill
that grubby bastard Ghurd, that's all.

170
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:02,295
This is no time to be feeling relieved.

171
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:06,105
Brace yourselves. We won't get lucky this time.

172
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:12,805
Hey, hey, hey! Ghurd got himself wasted!

173
00:20:12,845 --> 00:20:15,375
T-That is a problem...

174
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:20,915
Our Ginyu Special Corps fighting pose
won't be as beautiful with one of us missing!

175
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:29,555
ReaCoom!

176
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:32,455
Butta!

177
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:35,925
Jheese!

178
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:39,935
Ginyu Special Corps!

179
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:46,465
S-Sure enough, it's not beautiful.

180
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:53,745
We'll have to have Commander Ginyu
think up a new pose for the four of us.

181
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:56,415
Putting that aside, we have to decide

182
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,355
who is going to take out
those two runts in Ghurd's place.

183
00:20:59,395 --> 00:21:01,755
I still get Vegeta, you know.

184
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:04,325
All right, Jheese, rock-paper-scissors with me.

185
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:05,355
Okay!

186
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:06,755
First time is rock!

187
00:21:06,795 --> 00:21:08,765
Rock-scissors-paper!

188
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:13,505
Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

189
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:21,805
Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

190
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:25,815
W-What could those people be thinking?

191
00:21:25,855 --> 00:21:28,445
Yeah... I can't figure
out their character one bit.

192
00:21:28,485 --> 00:21:38,225
Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

193
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:41,425
The real hell starts now.

194
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:53,975
<i>Goku was moments away</i>

195

197

198
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:18,805
<i>Could they defeat ReaCoom, Butta, and Jheese?</i>

199

<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>

<i>They're tossing Vegeta around like a child!</i>
