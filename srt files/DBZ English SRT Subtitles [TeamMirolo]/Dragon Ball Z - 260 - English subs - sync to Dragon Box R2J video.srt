<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,070
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4

<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,710

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,600

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,620

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

<i>Within the alternate dimension</i>

24
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,270
<i>the battle between</i>

25
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,490

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,030
Go! Numbers 1 and 2, charge!

27
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,580
<i>However, the situation</i>
<i>had turned for the very worst.</i>

28
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,090
I-It's hopeless!

29
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,810
I don't have the kind of power left that
it takes to perform my great technique!

30
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,560
It's all over!

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,640
It's the end of the world!

32
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,860
<i>An anxious Piccolo</i>
<i>destroyed the only entranceway,</i>

33
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,440
<i>locking Majin Boo into an</i>
<i>alternate dimension of space!</i>

34
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,620
<i>Will Piccolo's desperate strategy be successful?</i>

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:02,800
<i>"Escape From Another Dimension!!</i>
<i>Super Gotenks 3."</i>

36
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,150
Majin Boo, if you're going to kill us, then kill us.

37
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,320
However, you will never be
able to leave this space again!

38
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,640
Um, Piccolo-<i>san</i>, does that
mean we can never leave too?

39
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,180
Yeah, unfortunately.
The entranceway has been closed off.

40
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,600
Nobody will be able to go outside
of this world of unlike dimension.

41
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,270
M-My precious candy!

42
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,860
There's none of that here!
No reason it should be, is there?

43
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,860
Not even cookies, ice cream, and chocolate?!

44
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,870
Gone! There's nothing at all!

45
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,450
Damn it to hell!!

46
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,170
W-What was that just now?
What the hell happened?

47
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,890
I-It's awful! Doorway to
Room of Spirit and Time closed off!

48
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,850
So, Piccolo has employed
the final measure, then?

49
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,850
The final measure? You mean
what you mentioned before?

50
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:46,860
Hmm. Not even Trunks and Goten
appear to have been a match for Majin Boo.

51
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,900
And so, Piccolo has destroyed the entranceway

52
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,780
to the Room of Spirit and Time,
shutting them all inside.

53
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,080
Now that Majin Boo is closed up
in a different dimension of space,

54
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,200
he will forever be unable to leave.

55
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,420
Th-Then, does that mean
that Trunks and Goten-<i>chan</i>

56
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,710
were done in by Majin Boo?

57
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,300
Hmm... P-Probably so.

58
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,300
You've got to be joking!
This is why I was against this!

59
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,010
B-Bulma-<i>san</i>! We do have the Dragon Balls,

60
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,260
so even if they have died
once, we can return them to–

61
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,680
That's not the issue, is it?! You're all cowards!

62
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,270
How can you have children fight against
that bad guy, no matter how strong they are?!

63
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,690
How can you leave the fate
of the whole Earth up to them?!

64
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,280
You're all just cowards!

65
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,280
My candy...!

66
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,290
My candy is... gone!

67
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:42,290
Hey! Piccolo-<i>san</i>! Why did you
do that without saying anything?!

68
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,880
I still had a great technique held in reserve!

69
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,500
Y-You what?!

70
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,210
You said something to the effect
that you were at your limit, didn't you?!

71
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,010
That was just a light joke!
One of those little white lies!

72
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,180
I absolutely, absolutely had a
technique that was sure to stop Majin Boo!

73
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,810
And now... now...!

74
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,690
What are you, brainless?!
There are no little lies at a time like this!!

75
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,270
It's not even the slightest bit little!
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

76
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,530
You're the stupid one! Stupid! Stupid!
I want to go back to our prior world!

77
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,860
Make the entranceway go back the way it was!

78
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,860
It's been blown apart! How am
I supposed to make it go back again?

79
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,700
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

80
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,410
I want candy! Candy...!

81
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:43,680
I can't stand this!!

82
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,200
Huh?

83
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,660
What's that?

84
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,870
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, what's that?

85
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,920
I-It couldn't be! I-I don't believe it!

86
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,800
That's it! With the fantastic power of his <i>ki,</i>

87
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,310
Majin Boo has opened up a hole
in the wall between dimensions...!

88
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,810
This is bad! He can escape!

89
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,860
The hole is disappearing!

90
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,110
I can't stand to be in this place!

91
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,870
He's escaping!

92
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,530
D-Dammit, no!

93
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,710
Yow!

94
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,370
It's vanished!

95
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,340
What's that?

96
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,510
It's Majin Boo's <i>ki</i>!

97
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,850
Looks as if he's finally come
out of the Room of Spirit and Time.

98
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,140
What about Goten-<i>san</i> and Trunks-<i>san</i>'s <i>ki</i>?

99
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:19,150
It's no use! I can't feel the half-pints' <i>ki.</i>

100
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,870
Damn it all! What the
hell is happening on Earth?

101
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:27,290
I wanna see... I sure would like to see!

102
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,790
Want a look, Goku?

103
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,710
Here!

104
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:54,230
Awesome! I can see! I can see it!

105
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:58,110
The temple is being shown! Whew!
We can see it, even this far away?!

106
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,290
What is that?!

107
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,790
This isn't good! That <i>ki</i>...!

108
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,670
What?

109
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,310
I-It's Majin Boo!

110
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,040
You! How dare you do that
to Trunks and Goten-<i>chan</i>!

111
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,380
Lucky! There are many here! I'm getting
a little hungry, so this is just right.

112
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,220
What should I make them?

113
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,760
I choose choco!

114
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,610
What kind of choco should I eat them as?
Choco bars would be good, I guess...

115
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:24,320
Maybe powdered choco? Maybe
choco ice cream would be good...

116
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,870
I'm scared! I'm scared of that man!

117
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,670
He's gotten away, hasn't he?!

118
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,630
Are we going to live the rest
of our lives out in here?!

119
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,210
Stop blubbering! Your blubbering
isn't going to allow us to leave here!

120
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,590
So then what do we do?!
Boo's gotten out of here!

121
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,850
The Earth might already
have been blown away by now!

122
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,190
Gotenks, how sure of your voice are you?

123
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,610
My voice?

124
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,610
The two of us are going
to yell as loud as we can.

125
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,530
It might break down the
wall between dimensions.

126
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,700
If Boo did it, there's no
reason we can't do it too.

127
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,660
All right! Let's go!

128
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,190
All right, one more time...

129
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,050
I wonder which will be the yummiest.

130
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,270
I'm scared!

131
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,280
<i>Damn. So it's Majin Boo–an opponent</i>
<i>not even Goku or Vegeta could beat?</i>

132
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,030
<i>Then I sure won't be beating him.</i>

133
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,830
<i>But if I don't do something,</i>
<i>who else is going to protect her?</i>

134
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,130
No. 18, I'm going to rush him.

135
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,630
When I do, you take her and
hide yourselves inside the temple.

136
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,930
You got that?

137
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,890
Goodbye. If things go well,

138
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,130
I'll see you again when I'm brought
back to life with the Dragon Balls!

139
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,520
Kuririn!

140
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,440
Kuririn...!

141
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,650
Now!!

142
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,980
Run!!

143
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,640
Tha'th one...

144
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,270
You're next!

145
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,560
No. 18!

146
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,540
That's two... that's three...

147
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,720
Who should I choose next?

148
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,220
Too much trouble! Everyone at once!

149
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,670
H-How awful...!

150
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,340
Damn it all...

151
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,100
That bastard! But, from here,
there ain't anything we can do!

152
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,270
U-Um, what's happened there, Father?

153
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,360
It's nothing. Gohan, don't
concern yourself with anything extra!

154
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,070
Just concentrate, and become able
to fight as soon as possible! Got it?

155
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:19,070
O-Okay!

156
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,080
What about Goten-<i>san</i> and the others?

157
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,500
I still can't feel their <i>ki.</i>
Have they been done in?

158
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,080
Th-That can't be it!

159
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,460
If Goten and Trunks have been beaten,

160
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:37,090
then that leaves no one to protect the Earth!

161
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:42,550
Still, something has to turn up! As long
as the Dragon Balls are left on Earth...!

162
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,130
I-It's no use! We haven't
even opened up a pinpoint hole!

163
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:16,420
While we're in here doing this, time
keeps passing on rapidly out there!

164
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,930
This is bad! Everyone will be...!

165
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,680
Sheesh, got no choice, huh?
Guess I have to use that.

166
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,690
I was hoping to turn during a
cooler scene than this, though.

167
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,480
W-What are you talking about?

168
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,650
What do you think?

169
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,070
Ow-ow-ow-ow!

170
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:41,650
Stop being so pretentious, you idiot!

171
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:47,500
Understood! Okay then, here goes!

172
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,040
Ta-da!!

173
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,140
Hey, what are you...?

174
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,040
Yea!

175
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:40,670
H-How did y-you do that?!

176
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,100
I don't know how I do it! You're shocked, huh?

177
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,430
Still, I'm extremely strong! Even so,

178
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,020
you get the feeling from my face that
I'm supposed to be playing a bad guy.

179
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,020
Well, I guess that makes me
the same as you, Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

180
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:03,240
I-It's Super Saiyan 3!
You guys couldn't possibly...!

181
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,490
Now then, this is no time to be talking, is it?

182
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:12,620
I can only be like this
for an incredibly short time!

183
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,020
I did it! I opened a hole!

184
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,200
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, why are you
standing there looking dazed?

185
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,280
Hurry up, or the hole will close!

186
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:14,520
Yo, yo, yo, Majin Boo!
We've come out of there too!

187
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,690
Oh? You were lucky to get out.

188
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,520
Huh?

189
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,650
Did you change a little bit?

190
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,110
Fool! I haven't just changed a little bit!

191
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:33,080
I've gotten incredibly,
incredibly, incredibly stronger!

192
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,500
Oh, they've come out!
Those pipsqueaks are alive!

193
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,670
Such an incredible <i>ki</i>!
Is that from their Fusion?

194
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:47,680
Yeah! That's Fusion for sure!
And what's more, he's Super Saiyan 3!

195
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,010
Super Saiyan 3?

196
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,850
Haven't I told you about that, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?

197
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,600
It would take too long to
tell you about it, but in short,

198
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,020
it's where you go above when
you've gone above Super Saiyan.

199
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,480
Going above going above Super Saiyan?

200
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,820
Unbelievable! Those little turds!

201
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,410
It took me many years until I was
finally able to reach Super Saiyan 3,

202
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,410
and they had no trouble with it!

203
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,290
Awesome! That's so awesome!

204
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,920
Th-The temple...

205
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,110
W-Why, you! What have you
done with the group that was here?!

206
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,160
They're right here.

207
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,000
Y-You ate them?!

208
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,290
Yeah! Once I turned them
into choco! They were yummy!

209
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,590
Mother too?!

210
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,470
Everybody!

211
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,880
N-Now I'm completely mad!!

212
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,320
<i>Gotenks and Piccolo at last have escaped.</i>

213
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,490
<i>However, neither Bulma</i>
<i>nor Kuririn are at the temple!</i>

214
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,750
<i>An angered Super Saiyan 3</i>
<i>Gotenks now takes off!</i>

215
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,760
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

216
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,310
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

217
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,910
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

218
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,990
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

219
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:09,000
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

220
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,380
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

221
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:18,260
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

222
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:27,310
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

223
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,850
<i>Even now?</i>

224
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:36,490
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

225
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,910
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

226
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:48,370
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

227
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:58,420
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

228
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,690
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

229
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,160
<i>Super Saiyan 3 power</i>
<i>sure is awesome, all right.</i>

230
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,910
<i>Majin Boo is being run ragged.</i>
<i>Nice going, Gotenks! Attaway!</i>

231
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,370
<i>Don't let your guard down,</i>
<i>Trunks-san, Goten-san!</i>

232
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,580
<i>Majin Boo isn't beaten yet!</i>

233
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,460
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

234
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,250
<i>"Going Too Far!? Boo-Boo Volleyball."</i>

235
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,710
<i>Guys, can't you perform your moves</i>
<i>without doing those poses each time?</i>

236
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,510
"Next time"
"Going Too Far!? Boo-Boo Volleyball"
