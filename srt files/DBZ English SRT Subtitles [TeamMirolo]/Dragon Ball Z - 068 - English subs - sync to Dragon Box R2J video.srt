00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,645
Why are they having no effect?!

17

<i>Crusher...</i>

He deflected it!

20
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:40,975
Damn it!

21
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:44,675
<i>Goku's strength is surprising.</i>

22
00:02:44,715 --> 00:02:49,045
<i>However, he still does not appear</i>
<i>to be taking this fight seriously.</i>

23
00:02:51,185 --> 00:02:57,215
<i>"At Last, a Direct Confrontation!!</i>
<i>Commander Ginyu Takes the Field."</i>

24
00:03:07,865 --> 00:03:09,465
Where did he go?

25
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,865
Behind you, Butta!

26
00:03:12,905 --> 00:03:13,895
What?!

27
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:18,875
Yo.

28
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:21,715
H-How did you get behind me?!

29
00:03:24,085 --> 00:03:28,045
Behind me, who prides himself
on being the fastest in the universe!

30
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,645
Then maybe you're second-fastest
in the universe, ain't you?

31
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:34,485
<i>H-How can this be?</i>

32
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:40,895
<i>Not only did he repel my Crusher Ball,</i>
<i>he managed to slip behind Butta!</i>

33
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:43,495
<i>It's as if I'm having a bad dream.</i>

34
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:50,475
Who are you?!

35
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:53,945
I am a Saiyan, who was
raised on Earth... I guess.

36
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:56,845
Don't be ridiculous!

37
00:03:56,885 --> 00:03:59,845
How can a Saiyan have that kind of speed?!

38
00:03:59,885 --> 00:04:04,255
How should I know? It must be
from my having trained so hard.

39
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:06,855
Still, you can't win on speed alone!

40
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:09,525
Not if all you're doing is running away!

41
00:04:11,465 --> 00:04:14,095
Once you've worn yourself out running
away, you'll lose those sharp reflexes,

42
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,535
and then you'll die!

43
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,705
Go ahead, dodge me!

44
00:04:30,485 --> 00:04:32,915
C-Can you see that?

45
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,385
Not at all.

46
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:46,295
Dammit!

47
00:04:46,335 --> 00:04:47,695
How can members of the Ginyu Special Corps

48
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:51,335
let that runt make fools of them?!

49
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:03,575
It's all you can do to just evade me!

50
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,815
I could defeat you right now!

51
00:05:04,855 --> 00:05:06,285
We'll see about that.

52
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:17,425
What do you think you're doing?!

53
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,255
What about you? Where were you looking?!

54
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:19,825
What?!

55
00:05:19,865 --> 00:05:21,455
Why you...

56
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:30,835
Hold on. This is no time
to be fighting each other.

57
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,005
R-Right.

58
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:35,645
Shall I show you then?

59
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:39,445
How there's more to me than just speed?

60
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:41,115
–What?!
–What?!

61
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:19,655
I hope you understand now.
Give up this senseless fight.

62
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:27,665
This guy, and the one
before him, are both still alive.

63
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:29,835
Hurry up and take the two
of them and get off this planet.

64
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:35,665
D-Don't be a fool! Kakarrot,
finish them! Finish them off!

65
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,335
These two are all beat up.

66
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:40,175
There's no need to kill them for no reason!

67
00:06:44,715 --> 00:06:49,675
H-How can this be? We're the
Ginyu Special Corps, you know!

68
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:56,255
W-We're a super elite fighting force,

69
00:06:56,295 --> 00:07:01,195
comprised of the five best
warriors in all the universe!

70
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:04,225
How can we be beaten
by such a low-level fighter?!

71
00:07:06,805 --> 00:07:08,335
This is a nightmare!

72
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:13,475
I'm going to be done in,
and there's nothing I can do!

73
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:17,645
He's running away!

74
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:21,415
There's no helping some people, huh?

75
00:07:21,455 --> 00:07:23,045
He just left his friends behind.

76
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:32,625
Sorry, guys, there ain't any senzu left.

77
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:33,635
Hey...

78
00:07:35,265 --> 00:07:37,635
A-Are you really Goku?

79
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:43,075
Yeah. I've just been through
some incredible training is all.

80
00:07:47,685 --> 00:07:48,645
Vegeta!

81
00:08:12,635 --> 00:08:16,775
How could you?! I told you
there was no need to finish them off!

82
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:19,835
Those guys couldn't even move.

83
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:25,845
It utterly sickens me with
how lenient you always are!

84
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,755
Why did you let that other one get away?

85
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:34,455
With your strength now, you
could have easily disposed of him!

86
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:42,795
It appears that you were unable to
fully become a Super Saiyan after all.

87
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:45,665
Super Saiyan?

88
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,205
You seem to be proud with how
overwhelmingly strong you've become,

89
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:50,705
but even so, there's no way you can beat Freeza.

90
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:53,145
Not unless you make
yourself immortal or something.

91
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:58,945
You have no idea how terrible Freeza is!

92
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:01,715
I hate to sound like I'm blowing my own horn,

93
00:09:01,755 --> 00:09:04,555
but I think I've become a lot stronger.

94
00:09:04,595 --> 00:09:08,555
Even so, you say that there's no
way I can defeat this Freeza guy?

95
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:12,725
That's right. If you plan on
fighting him, then brace yourself.

96
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:18,735
Freeza's strength goes far beyond
anything you can even imagine.

97
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:21,865
A-Are you sure you're
not exaggerating a little bit?

98
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:25,735
I mean, you saw Goku's strength just now, right?

99
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:28,505
Those guys were powerless against him!

100
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:32,575
Is there anyone who can beat Goku now?

101
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:35,615
In that case, go ahead and try fighting him.

102
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:40,525
What's even worse is that by now,

103
00:09:40,565 --> 00:09:43,755
Freeza has probably become
immortally young with the Dragon Balls.

104
00:09:43,795 --> 00:09:46,725
Any way you cut it,
there's no way to beat him now.

105
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,635
We can only pray that we don't run into him.

106
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:55,705
I don't think he's made his wish yet.

107
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:58,105
W-What? How can you tell?!

108
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:03,545
If the Dragon Balls here are the
same as the Dragon Balls on Earth,

109
00:10:03,585 --> 00:10:06,715
then when Shen Long appears,
the sky is supposed to get dark, right?

110
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,055
But up to now, the sky has remained bright.

111
00:10:17,765 --> 00:10:20,565
I don't think it's happened yet.

112
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:23,565
S-Shen Long? What is that?

113
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:26,565
W-When you get the Dragon Balls
together, does something come out?

114
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:31,735
T-That's it! I've got it! He
doesn't know what the password is!

115
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:35,745
He must think that just gathering all seven
Dragon Balls together will grant him his wish.

116
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:39,985
A password? You need that too?

117
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:44,585
There's still a chance for
us to get our wish granted!

118
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,815
Oh, yeah!

119
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:54,565
Hey, Gohan! We still might be able
to bring our dead friends back to life!

120
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:55,925
Hooray!

121
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,095
Isn't that great, Gohan?

122
00:10:57,135 --> 00:10:57,935
Yeah!

123
00:10:57,975 --> 00:11:01,305
Yay! We're saved!

124
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:06,105
Goku, that means we have to
get the Dragon Balls back, huh?

125
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,635
That's right.

126
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,815
<i>S-Shen Long...</i>

127
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:26,455
To think that these things can grant any wish...

128
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:37,005
After Freeza<i>-sama</i> gets the
password from the Namekians,

129
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:39,135
he'll be able to obtain eternal life...

130
00:11:39,175 --> 00:11:44,545
Which means the whole
universe will belong to Freeza.

131
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:47,055
What a wonderful thought.

132
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:19,675
What did you say?! Ghurd,
ReaCoom, and Butta were all killed?!

133
00:12:19,715 --> 00:12:23,245
Yes, by some unbelievable kind of guy.

134
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,255
Don't be ridiculous!

135
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:26,855
We are the Ginyu Special Corps!

136
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:29,385
With the exception of Freeza<i>-sama,</i>

137
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:33,255
there is no one in the world
stronger than the Ginyu Special Corps!

138
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:37,705
T-That's what I thought
too, but the fact remains...

139
00:12:47,315 --> 00:12:50,215
So, having those three
battle ability ratings disappear

140
00:12:50,255 --> 00:12:54,615
wasn't a Scouter malfunction, huh?

141
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,855
Should we contact Freeza<i>-sama</i>?

142
00:12:56,895 --> 00:13:02,455
You must be joking! How can
we tell him such shameful news?!

143
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:04,795
It's a good thing Freeza<i>-sama</i> is not here.

144
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,735
I, Commander Ginyu, will give you an example

145
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,805
of how a real battle is to be waged.

146
00:13:14,845 --> 00:13:17,235
I-If you please.

147
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,435
Hide the Dragon Balls!

148
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:22,805
If anything happens to them, you
will suffer the wrath of Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

149
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,645
Yes, sir!

150
00:13:35,295 --> 00:13:38,895
Hey you guys, this isn't a game! Hurry up!

151
00:13:38,935 --> 00:13:40,335
Yes, sir!

152
00:14:06,825 --> 00:14:09,955
There, no one will find them now.

153
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,825
All right then, we're off.

154
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:15,665
I'm going to show them
meticulously just how dreadful I can be.

155
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:29,315
Ginyu Special Corps, move out!

156
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:39,215
Sure enough, it doesn't have
the same impact with only two of us.

157
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:43,225
And I just got done
thinking up a new one, too...

158
00:14:43,265 --> 00:14:47,705
I don't know who you are, but
you're going to pay! You're going to pay!

159
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:56,665
I've had it with Dad.

160
00:14:56,705 --> 00:15:00,705
How can he say that Son<i>-kun</i>
should have already landed on Namek?

161
00:15:02,385 --> 00:15:07,375
Once Son<i>-kun</i> gets here, <i>I</i> should
be the first one he comes and saves.

162
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:14,785
I've been looking after
Son<i>-kun</i> ever since he was little.

163
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:24,795
It's no use. These are all
beyond repair. I don't care anymore!

164
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:43,055
I wonder if Son<i>-kun</i> has landed yet.

165
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:50,395
It would be great if we could get the
Dragon Balls back from them somehow.

166
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:54,025
Vegeta, you know them pretty well, right?

167
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:55,725
Is there any way to go about it?

168
00:15:55,765 --> 00:15:59,565
Weren't you planning to defeat Freeza?

169
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:03,575
I'd like to if possible, but first,
we have to bring everyone

170
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:06,405
who you killed on Earth back to life.

171
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:13,145
Come to think of it, Kaio<i>-sama</i> told
me not to fight Freeza, no matter what.

172
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:15,745
Even if you get such a worthless
wish granted, it won't do any good

173
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:20,585
if Freeza just comes along and
wipes out all of Earth soon after, will it?

174
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:24,155
Instead, let me wish myself immortally young.

175
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:25,825
You've got to be kidding!

176
00:16:25,865 --> 00:16:30,825
Letting you do that is no different
from letting Freeza do so, is it?!

177
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,605
There are two battle powers headed this way!

178
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:41,205
So, he's gracing us with his presence?

179
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:51,815
You let Jheese get away, and now
he's returning with Commander Ginyu.

180
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:57,595
This time, no matter how strong you may be,

181
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:59,955
you're going to have one
tough opponent to handle.

182
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:03,805
Him, huh? This one is going
to be trouble all right, Goku.

183
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:07,965
Wait a minute, where's Freeza?

184
00:17:08,005 --> 00:17:10,105
Now that he's got the Dragon Balls from Ginyu,

185
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:12,605
he should be at his spaceship.

186
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:15,635
Looks like he ain't there any more.

187
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:36,565
I can feel a strong <i>ki</i>
way off in this direction.

188
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:40,165
That's probably Freeza.

189
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:42,565
B-But that direction is...

190
00:17:42,605 --> 00:17:46,205
Oh no! That's where Grand Elder<i>-san</i> is!

191
00:17:47,615 --> 00:17:49,075
Grand Elder?

192
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:52,915
I get it! Freeza was unable
to get his wish granted,

193
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,545
so now he's headed off to
ask a Namekian directly about it!

194
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:59,515
What? You mean there's
still some surviving Namekians?

195
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:03,085
That's probably the one who
created the Dragon Balls here.

196
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:06,925
Yeah, that would be Grand Elder<i>-san.</i>

197
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:09,095
T-This is bad!

198
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:12,365
Once he finds out how to get his wish granted,

199
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:15,705
he's certain to kill
Grand Elder<i>-san</i> and the others!

200
00:18:15,745 --> 00:18:19,115
And if Grand Elder<i>-san</i> dies...

201
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:30,955
Once I pass away, the
Dragon Balls will also disappear.

202
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:32,955
He doesn't know that if Grand Elder<i>-san</i> dies,

203
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:36,185
the Dragon Balls will be lost too!

204
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:38,425
W-What?

205
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,475
They're here!

206
00:19:09,965 --> 00:19:12,925
You certainly made a
mockery of us earlier, huh?

207
00:19:12,965 --> 00:19:17,165
Now the Commander is here to
personally make you suffer the consequences!

208
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:22,935
How about it, Goku? Do you have
a chance of winning this time, too?

209
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:24,935
I won't know until I try.

210
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:29,775
This guy sure appears to have an
impressive level of strength, after all.

211
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:35,515
I see, so this is him, huh?

212
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:40,115
His battle power reads about 5000.

213
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:43,955
That's right, only 5000. Strange, isn't it?

214
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:45,985
You idiot!

215
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:51,865
You were made to look like fools because
you only relied on the Scouter's rating.

216
00:19:51,905 --> 00:19:56,705
No doubt he just raised his battle
power dramatically for just a moment.

217
00:19:56,745 --> 00:19:59,505
That's the type he is.

218
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:05,045
In my estimation, I'd say he has an
actual battle power of around 60,000.

219
00:20:05,085 --> 00:20:11,285
60,000? But he's a Saiyan! I've never
heard of a Saiyan with a 60,000 rating.

220
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:14,985
It's not unheard of. He was probably
born an extremely gifted warrior,

221
00:20:15,025 --> 00:20:18,055
some kind of mutant, just like we were.

222
00:20:18,095 --> 00:20:19,995
This is shaping up to be a
fight more interesting than any

223
00:20:20,035 --> 00:20:22,495
I've experienced before.

224
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:25,365
I didn't think the time would
ever come when Ginyu<i>-sama</i>

225
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:29,505
would have to display his true power.

226
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:35,075
I'll keep them busy. You guys use the
Dragon Radar to find the Dragon Balls.

227
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:39,145
They're probably still near their spaceship.

228
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:42,545
If I'm able to defeat these
guys, I'll join you shortly.

229
00:20:42,585 --> 00:20:45,985
Don't sound so discouraging!
Make sure you beat them!

230
00:20:46,025 --> 00:20:47,085
Right.

231
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:51,425
Okay, let's go! We have to hurry,
before Grand Elder<i>-san</i> gets killed.

232
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,425
He may already have been...

233
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,425
At any rate, hurry!

234
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:58,865
Vegeta, you take care of the other one.

235
00:20:58,905 --> 00:21:00,765
Now that you've recovered
from being near death,

236
00:21:00,805 --> 00:21:03,665
your power should be much greater.

237
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:06,235
He's no longer an
unbeatable opponent, right?

238
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,875
You knew about that, huh?

239
00:21:07,915 --> 00:21:09,875
Really?

240
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:13,045
All right, get going! And be careful!

241
00:21:13,085 --> 00:21:13,845
We're off!

242
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:15,355
Good luck, Goku!

243
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:19,055
They're getting away!

244
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:21,085
Let them go. They're small fry.

245
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,925
Damn it, let there still be time!

246
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:26,435
Hang in there, Grand Elder<i>-san.</i>

247
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:46,475
All right, we're up, too.

248
00:21:46,515 --> 00:21:48,245
Guess we've got no choice.

249
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:15,135
See you later, Kakarrot!

250
00:22:17,555 --> 00:22:19,515
Vegeta!

251
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,115
Your guard is down!

252
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:23,955
<i>Vegeta's ambitions are frightful.</i>

253
00:22:23,995 --> 00:22:29,825
<i>And now, a direct battle</i>
<i>between Goku and Ginyu begins.</i>

254
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:48,645
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

255
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:54,485
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

256
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,855
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

257
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:05,355
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

258
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:11,865
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

259
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:15,965
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

260
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:19,475
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

261
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:22,105
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

262
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:29,615
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

263
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,715
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

264
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:35,525
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

265
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:39,555
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

266
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:45,235
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

267
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,405
<i>So sorry.</i>

268
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:52,535
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

269
00:23:55,285 --> 00:24:00,545
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

270
00:24:12,265 --> 00:24:14,265
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

271
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:17,395
<i>That jerk Vegeta! He's</i>
<i>leaving me to fight this guy,</i>

272
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:19,895
<i>while he takes the</i>
<i>opportunity to get the Dragon Balls.</i>

273
00:24:19,935 --> 00:24:23,565
<i>I'm so excited. It's rare that I get</i>
<i>to have a fight as enjoyable as this.</i>

274
00:24:23,605 --> 00:24:26,435
<i>Hurry up and show me your true power!</i>

275
00:24:26,475 --> 00:24:28,245
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

276
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:32,045
<i>"Incredible Force!!</i>
<i>Did You See Goku's Full Power?"</i>

277
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:34,825
<i>Father, are you really a Super Saiyan?</i>

278
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:38,255
"Next time"
"Incredible Force!!
Did You See Goku's Full Power?"
