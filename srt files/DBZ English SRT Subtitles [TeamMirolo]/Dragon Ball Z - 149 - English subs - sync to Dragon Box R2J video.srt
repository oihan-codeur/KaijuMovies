<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,700

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,960
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,300
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:52,150
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

7
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,650
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:04,660
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,120
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,630
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:26,600
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,090
<i>At last, Goku has recovered.</i>

17
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,260
<i>However, it is already too late.</i>

18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:07,590
<i>A battle between Piccolo and the</i>
<i>Artificial Human No. 17 is already underway.</i>

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,330
Too bad. That's a pity, isn't it?

20
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,450
Ha! I'm still just getting started!

21
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
This <i>ki</i> is that of Piccolo.

22
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,590
The opponents he would be
fighting at such a high power...

23
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,130
...could only be No. 17 and the others!

24
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,510
You just wait!

25
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,180
My power is far greater than yours!

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,310
<i>Cell has begun moving out in earnest,</i>

27
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,110
<i>heading toward his perfect form!</i>

28
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,480
<i>What has been feared is now coming true.</i>

29
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:13,080
<i>"How I Have Waited for This Day!!</i>
<i>Cell's Prologue to Perfection."</i>

30
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:43,900
For not even being an Artificial
Human, you have fantastic power.

31
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,200
It is certainly apparent that
you are not Piccolo Daimao.

32
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:56,250
Of course, I have no interest in your identity.

33
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,920
I only want to know where Son Goku is.

34
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,710
As usual, I don't suppose you
are of the mind to tell us, are you?

35
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,550
Your objective is to kill Goku.

36
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:12,930
There's no reason that
I should tell you where he is.

37
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,850
Well then, shall we continue the fight?

38
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,890
I think you'll come to want to speak.

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,070
This time, I'm fighting like I mean it!

40
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,340
Your speed is decent.

41
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,640
But your punches don't seem
to have enough weight behind them.

42
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,510
<i>What was that?!</i>

43
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,350
How nice of you to talk so big.

44
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,140
As you face the strongest man in history,

45
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,060
Artificial Human No. 17...

46
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,030
That guy really is strong.

47
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,080
He's evenly matched against No. 17.

48
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,720
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, hang in there!

49
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,430
Keep it up, Piccolo!

50
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,970
Until Vegeta and Trunks' training is finished...

51
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,010
Yeesh. How many islands
are you going to destroy

52
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,100
before you're satisfied?

53
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,080
A-Awesome. Piccolo still
seems to be hanging in there.

54
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,130
Dammit, are we just going to stay here like this?

55
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,100
How can this be?!

56
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,650
W-What's wrong?

57
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:43,650
H-He's coming closer! At a time like this...!

58
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,820
C-Cell?

59
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,700
I-It can't be!

60
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,490
I've waited a long time for this day to come!

61
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,530
The day when I become my perfect form!

62
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,910
Ah, there, there! There,
there! Googley googley goo!

63
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,950
Don't cry, now. Don't cry.

64
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,330
Bulma, I can't manage him!

65
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,330
This is the last frequency.

66
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,710
Once I finish punching in
this data, it will be complete!

67
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,380
Say, Dad, keep Trunks quiet a bit longer!

68
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:36,140
Yeah, well, you see...

69
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,940
You're his mother, ain'tcha?

70
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,480
Come look after yer baby
some! It's more'n I can stand!

71
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,610
'nbelievable! Bein' raised by
such a cold mother like this,

72
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,650
in time this kid's gonna go bad!

73
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,290
Horsefeathers! There's no
need to worry about that!

74
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:03,000
Trunks is going to become an incredibly
cool and handsome young man, after all.

75
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,460
Aren't you, Trunks?

76
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,920
Is it okay now? Are you finished?

77
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:18,220
With this, we'll be able to utterly
terminate Artificial Humans' actions!

78
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,490
My, my!

79
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,670
What do we do, Kuririn?

80
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,340
H-How can I answer something like that?

81
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,470
If this Cell monster were to
absorb the Artificial Humans now,

82
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:07,480
all of our hopes would vanish.

83
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,190
Damn!

84
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,480
Kuririn! Bulma's callin' on the phone for you!

85
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,490
Come take it!

86
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,530
She's sayin' somethin' about havin'
found a weakness in the Artificial Humans!

87
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,120
–What's that?!
–What?!

88
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,240
That's right!

89
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,080
No. 17 and No. 18 have
emergency shutdown circuitry...

90
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,920
...incorporated into their bodies!

91
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,340
Once we shut off activity in those circuits,

92
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,920
then no matter if they are Artificial Humans,

93
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,380
you can destroy them easily, right?

94
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,890
Yeah! I just completed
a controller that will do it!

95
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,350
Say, can we beat the Artificial Humans?

96
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,970
Uh huh...

97
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,890
Beg your pardon, but could
you bring it here right away?

98
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,690
Right now, Piccolo-<i>san</i> is fighting
with them–the Artificial Humans!

99
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:56,110
Sure! I'll leave right away!

100
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,110
Great! If we destroy No. 17 and the others,

101
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,070
Cell cannot become his perfect form!

102
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,750
Destroy, huh?

103
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,510
What is it?

104
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,720
I-It's nothing.

105
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,560
Well, I'm off.

106
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,470
Take good care, if you please.

107
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,480
What's this "if you please"?!

108
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,900
You were gonna leave
here all by yerself, weren'cha?

109
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:39,030
The Earth is in great danger! Let me go!

110
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:52,920
F-Father! Cell has... Cell has started to move!

111
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,960
Yeah. I know.

112
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,170
Still not yet?

113
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,340
Vegeta is extremely gifted.

114
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,130
He should have overcome
the Super Saiyan wall long ago.

115
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,930
Please hurry, Vegeta.

116
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,730
What will happen cannot be undone!

117
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,500
Our powers may be evenly matched,

118
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:48,420
but there appears to be a gap
widening between our stamina.

119
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,840
My energy will never drop!

120
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,110
C-Cell!

121
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,370
<i>At length, Cell has appeared!</i>

122
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
<i>Has the time at last come...</i>

123
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,440
<i>...for him to merge with No. 17 and No. 18?</i>

124
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,340
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

125
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:53,130
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

126
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,510
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

127
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:04,020
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

128
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:10,530
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

129
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,650
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

130
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,160
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

131
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,780
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

132
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:28,290
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

133
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,380
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

134
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,220
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

135
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,220
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

136
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,930
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

137
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,060
<i>So sorry.</i>

138
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,230
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

139
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:59,240
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

140
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,880
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

141
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,170
<i>Damn, what a ki. Cell has</i>
<i>raised his power like crazy.</i>

142
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:18,880
<i>Stop, Piccolo! Not even you're a match for him!</i>

143
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,430
<i>Curse you, Cell! Just how</i>
<i>many people have you sacrificed!?</i>

144
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,930
<i>There's no way I'm letting</i>
<i>you reach your perfect form!</i>

145
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,850
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

<i>Piccolo's Flame Burns Out!!"</i>

147

<i>Oh, no! Piccolo-san's ki is fading out!</i>
