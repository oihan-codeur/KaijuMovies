Piccolo-<i>sama</i>!! Piccolo-<i>sama</i>!!

24
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:45,775
If you go now, you can't beat him! Wait!

25
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:48,315
In any case, all we can do is wait!

Father, I'm going!

00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,255
W-Why?

30
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:53,095
I thought I told you to wait!

31
00:03:53,135 --> 00:03:56,595
But at this rate, everyone
will become casualties of Cell!

32
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:03,565
Gohan,

33
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,815
what your dad says right.

34
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:11,115
Popo-<i>san...</i>

35
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:16,325
If go now, cannot defeat Cell.
Only increase casualties by one.

36
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:20,455
Even so–even so, it's better
than just waiting around here...

37
00:04:20,495 --> 00:04:23,915
...looking on as everyone else gets killed!

38
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:30,545
You Saiyans only hope

<i>Vegeta, get out here, quick!</i>

42
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:26,185
Even having merged with Kami,

43
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,855
he was still no match for me, all powered-up!

44
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:36,485
Sorry to keep you waiting.

45
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:46,545
You will cease all your useless resistance.

46
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:48,125
Since you're going to be absorbed anyway,

47
00:05:48,165 --> 00:05:51,585
there are to be no pained feelings.

48
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:56,715
I will be taking you very shortly!

49
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:27,745
If you're coming at me, then come on!

50
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,215
Useless resistance, you say?!

51
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:39,255
I won't be had so easily!

52
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:47,765
You monstrous punk!

53
00:07:15,585 --> 00:07:18,135
You expect me to let you absorb me?!

54
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:55,875
<i>This is bad! The difference</i>
<i>in their power is too great!</i>

55
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,525
Trunks!

56
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:22,865
You must not touch this!

57
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:26,905
This is something very important, after all!

58
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:38,545
Oops, this isn't any good.

59
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,875
You mustn't cry, Trunks!

60
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:48,555
Trunks, let's say "Hello" and talk on this, okay?

61
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,095
It'll be fun!

62
00:08:56,105 --> 00:08:58,525
So, I wonder who will answer.

63
00:08:58,565 --> 00:09:01,655
Will it be that dirty old man Turtle Hermit?

64
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,485
Or will it be that shaven-headed Kuririn?

65
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,745
Hi! This is Bulma! Is anyone there?

66
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:10,745
Oh, Bulma?

67
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:12,955
See, they answered!

68
00:09:17,205 --> 00:09:20,175
Bulma, can you see Kuririn from there?

69
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:21,965
Huh? Kuririn?

70
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,095
I don't see him, why?

71
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,105
No, huh? Kuririn is actually headed towards you.

72
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:36,605
Oh, really?

73
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:41,105
That way I can hand over the
controller sooner, which works for me!

74
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:44,735
Yeah. In any case, we're
on the verge of a real fix.

75
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:47,195
If we don't stop No. 17 and the others soon,

76
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,445
then once they're absorbed by Cell,

77
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:51,455
it'll be the end of everything!

78
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:52,615
That's true.

79
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:56,785
I'll be careful so I don't miss seeing Kuririn!

80
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:01,665
Okay, Trunks, we're going to hyper-speed!

81
00:11:00,475 --> 00:11:01,645
What's wrong?

82
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:05,065
I thought you weren't going
to be had so easily, right?

83
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:12,735
This is why I told you to
cease your useless resistance.

84
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:27,045
It certainly appears that I'd
be better off running away.

85
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:30,675
Yeah, that's right. Escape by yourself.

86
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:36,975
If you and No. 17 are both absorbed,

87
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,145
that's when the end comes.

88
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:41,185
For the world, that is.

89
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:46,025
What are you going to do?

90
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,855
I'm going to destroy Cell.

91
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:53,865
The time for me to fight has come,

92
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,705
even before encountering Son Goku.

93
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:26,315
What are you doing, No. 16?!

94
00:12:26,355 --> 00:12:28,525
Stop! You'll be killed!

95
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:34,825
You guys are good folks.

96
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:36,365
You didn't take the lives of either humans

97
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:38,535
or animals for the fun of it.

98
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:46,705
I enjoyed travelling together with you.

99
00:12:58,765 --> 00:13:01,225
What does he think he's doing?

100
00:13:01,265 --> 00:13:03,515
Is he thinking of fighting with Cell?

101
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:33,295
Looks as though you don't
even have the power to get up.

102
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,595
Isn't it about time you let me absorb you?

103
00:13:48,475 --> 00:13:51,855
L-Let me go, you ugly monstrous freak!

104
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:54,275
Just looking at that squashed
bug-looking face of yours...

105
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:56,445
...makes me want to puke!

106
00:13:56,485 --> 00:14:00,615
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!
Babble all you want!

107
00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:05,125
You're about to become one
with this "monstrous freak."

108
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:06,585
Dammit!

109
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:27,305
And now I will have you.

110
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:43,365
Damn you, monster!

111
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,375
So, another reckless fool appears, huh?

112
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,175
What are you doing, No. 16?

113
00:15:43,215 --> 00:15:46,135
Don't tell me you intend to fight?

114
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:49,515
There is no other way.

115
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:52,475
A-Are you planning on
getting yourself destroyed?

116
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:56,485
By my calculations, Cell and
I both possess about equal power.

117
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,445
What?!

118
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:41,905
H-He's fighting blow-for-blow with Cell!

119
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:08,155
Hmph! How simple!

120
00:18:08,195 --> 00:18:10,655
So, shall I absorb you then?

121
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,175
Y-You're...

122
00:18:35,225 --> 00:18:38,185
Damn, you're completely robot?!

123
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:15,305
Oh, your speed is really something.

124
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:19,555
Well, how about this?

125
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:51,005
My tail isn't just there for
the purpose of absorbing things!

126
00:19:58,135 --> 00:19:59,185
Goodbye!

127
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,485
H-He did it!

128
00:20:57,995 --> 00:21:01,865
Now you will no longer be
able to absorb No. 17 and No. 18.

129
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:12,885
He's really gotten him for us!

130
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:21,595
What a pity, huh?

131
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:31,775
I have Piccolo's cells incorporated within me.

132
00:21:57,715 --> 00:22:01,475
I can regenerate myself, at
least to an extent such as this!

133
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:16,365
<i>At last, No. 16 displays his unassailable power!</i>

134
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:20,705
<i>However, does Cell's power rise above even his?</i>

135
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:23,285
<i>Hurry, Vegeta and Trunks!</i>

136
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:27,085
<i>Cell must not be allowed his perfect form!</i>

137
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:47,855
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

138
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:53,655
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

139
00:22:53,695 --> 00:22:56,065
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

140
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:04,535
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

141
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:11,085
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

142
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:15,175
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

143
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:18,675
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

144
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:21,305
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

145
00:23:23,055 --> 00:23:28,805
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

146
00:23:31,065 --> 00:23:32,895
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

147
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:34,735
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

148
00:23:34,775 --> 00:23:38,735
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

149
00:23:38,775 --> 00:23:44,455
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

150
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:46,575
<i>So sorry.</i>

151
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:51,745
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

152
00:23:54,505 --> 00:23:59,755
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

153
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,975
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

154
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,645
<i>No. 16's attacks ain't gonna work anymore.</i>

155
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:17,985
<i>Cell has absorbed No. 17,</i>
<i>and gained incredible power.</i>

156
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,655
<i>Can you hear me No. 18? It's wonderful!</i>

157
00:24:20,695 --> 00:24:22,155
