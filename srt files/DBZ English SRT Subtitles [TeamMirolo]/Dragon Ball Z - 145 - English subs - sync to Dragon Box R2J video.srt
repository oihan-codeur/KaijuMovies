<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,780
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,640
<i>Cell, an extraordinary monster</i>
<i>who has come from the future,</i>

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,300
<i>continues his growth!</i>

18
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,850
<i>Cell is an Artificial Human,</i>
<i>created by Doctor Gero's computer,</i>

19
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:15,320
<i>from the assembled cells of</i>
<i>Goku, Vegeta, Freeza, and others.</i>

20
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,460
When I merge with No. 17 and No. 18,

21
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,160
I will become my perfect form,
with power to defy the imagination!

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,330
For that reason, I came from the future!

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,240
I will acquire No. 18 and No. 17 no matter what!

24
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,050
No matter how you may try to prevent
me from becoming my perfect form,

25
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,510
it will come to nothing!

26
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,880
Not as long as the only
one that can hope to fight

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,320
against No. 17 and No. 18 is Piccolo!

28
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,680
<i>Taiyo-ken</i>!

29
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,660
Ah, dammit!

30
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,330
Damn!

31
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,520
<i>Will it indeed be possible</i>
<i>to frustrate Cell's scheme?</i>

32
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:21,720
<i>"The Secret of Cell's Birth!</i>
<i>What Lies Below the Laboratory?"</i>

33
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,270
...and that's how it stands.

34
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,080
In order to merge with No. 17 and No. 18

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,010
and become his perfect form,
he's come from the future.

36
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,450
What a fix.

37
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,560
So we have to find that Cell guy from
earlier somehow and take him down.

38
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,390
But can we seek him out?

39
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,630
Now that he knows of Piccolo<i>-san</i>'s
unexpectedly great strength,

40
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,300
won't he just assault other people
while keeping his <i>ki</i> suppressed?

41
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,770
If we don't prevent Cell,
No. 17 and No. 18 from merging,

42
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,640
no matter the cost, things will get unbearable!

43
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,310
And not just for Earth.

44
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,650
It will be terrible for all
the worlds in the universe!

45
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,880
Don't forget that he has
Freeza and his father's blood

46
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,480
running through him as well!

47
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,650
My blood too!

48
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,490
You've got nothing but clumsy strategies!

49
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,290
If he wants to merge
with them, then let him!

50
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,460
It'll reduce the number of opponents
we have to beat and save us some trouble.

51
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,430
I don't care what becomes of my enemy!

52
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,070
I'll just kill them anyhow!

53
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,270
Don't take it so lightly, Vegeta!

54
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,900
If they merge,

55
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,640
then as utterly unmanageable
as No. 17 and the others were,

56
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,780
he'll far surpass even them!

57
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,610
Don't you use that big-shot tone with me!

58
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,060
Do you want to be wiped out
before the Artificial Humans are?!

59
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,500
Hmph! I will go beyond, count on it!

60
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:20,340
Beyond even Super Saiyan!

61
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,050
Go beyond even Super Saiyan?!

62
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,880
Kakarrot will likely try to do the same.

63
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,320
That's for sure!

64
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,060
I am going to do this my own way!

65
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,330
You all do whatever you wish among yourselves!

66
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,710
Go beyond Super Saiyan, he said...

67
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,250
Beyond the terrifying
strength of a Super Saiyan...

68
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,280
Was he serious? Is such a thing possible?

69
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,460
Hey, Trunks...

70
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,860
It would be meaningless to take your
time machine back a little into the past

71
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,060
and destroy No. 17 and such, right?

72
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,870
Yes. It would probably be fine
for the future of that dimension,

73
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,070
but it wouldn't relate to this dimension.

74
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,440
Well, that means it wouldn't do any
good to go to Doctor Gero's laboratory now

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,470
and destroy that unfinished Cell, huh?

76
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,550
No, let's destroy him.

77
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,450
At the very least, Cell won't be able to
be born in the future of this dimension.

78
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,260
All right, you guys go to the laboratory.

79
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,560
I'm going to look around
the area here some more.

80
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,560
Right.

81
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,400
I'll remain here too.

82
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,470
Well, if it doesn't look
like you're going to find Cell,

83
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,640
come to the Kame House.

84
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,640
By watching the TV news, we might
be able to get a hold of his location.

85
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,480
Okay, got it.

86
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,490
Well then...

87
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,870
Go beyond even Super Saiyan?

88
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,640
I've never even thought of such a thing!

89
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,280
Certainly not.

90
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,480
But it could be possible, right?
Knowing Vegeta and Goku...

91
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,880
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

92
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,080
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, it's your mother!

93
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,540
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

94
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,500
Ah? Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

95
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,670
So you're out here studyin', are you?

96
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,910
Commendable, commendable!
Here, have a snack.

97
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,250
Your studies are makin' progress here!

98
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,990
I really must have you become
a great scholar, Gohan<i>-chan.</i>

99
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,460
That's what I've been dreamin' of.

100
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,660
Well, keep studyin' hard!

101
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,290
Right!

102
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,870
Forgive me, Mother.

103
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,080
What I really want to do
is grow strong like Father,

104
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,550
and be of service to everyone!

105
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,320
Hmm, "the son of a frog is a frog," indeed.

106
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,990
So cold!

107
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,630
Is there really anything
under this laboratory anyhow?

108
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,000
How should we search for it?

109
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,940
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, please stand back a moment.

110
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,470
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

111
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,470
Eh? What is it?

112
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,320
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, this is probably it!

113
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,390
–You're right.
–Well, let's go see!

114
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,550
Okay!

115
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,570
Be careful.

116
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,500
Right.

117
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,490
Rotten piece of crap!
This is that computer, huh?!

118
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,470
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, please look at this!

119
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,910
This is surely what will become Cell!

120
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,000
Dammit, this is what has all the cells

121
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,600
of the martial arts masters gathered within it?

122
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,570
Me and Goku must be included in there!

123
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,600
Just looking at it disgusts me!

124
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:10,810
I-In time, this will become a larva...

125
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,390
...shed its skin, and become Cell!

126
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,960
And then after that, he will
suck out the life energy of others

127
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,400
as he approaches his perfect form!

128
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,000
All of it under instruction from this computer.

129
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,410
Trunks, let's destroy this whole
underground laboratory right now!

130
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,410
W-Wait, just a minute!

131
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,490
They're plans!

132
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,160
What are they plans for? That Cell guy?

133
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,990
No, it has "No. 17" written here.

134
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,330
No. 17?

135
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,170
His, huh?

136
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,640
I-If I have Mom look at these, she just might

137
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,580
be able to catch on to a
weakness in No. 17, Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

138
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,580
Yeah! That's a good idea!

139
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,550
Say, are there any more?
Maybe the ones for Cell, or...

140
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,960
The rest of this...

141
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,160
...doesn't look like it would be of any use.

142
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,000
All right, then let's bring
down this underground laboratory!

143
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,970
Right!

144
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:02,820
Because of you, we in the future have suffered!

145
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,980
Take this!

146
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,170
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, let's get out of here, quick!

147
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,830
Okay!

148
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,020
Now to finish you off, you bastard!

149
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,130
We did it, Trunks!

150
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,010
Finding No. 17's plans in there
was an unexpected harvest, wasn't it?

151
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,010
Yes!

152
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,550
Um, Kuririn<i>-san</i>, would you take
these plans to where my mom is for me?

153
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,150
Huh? You're not coming with me?

154
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,990
I want to go try training together with my dad.

155
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,060
If he really can go beyond
being a Super Saiyan, then I...

156
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,800
That's fine, but...

157
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,070
well, he's your father, so I don't
want to say anything bad, but...

158
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,410
I don't think Vegeta will
let you do anything with him.

159
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,180
For my part, I don't really want to do this either.

160
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,180
However, even Dad has to know

161
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,820
that by training while
sparring against each other,

162
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,190
we'll grow a lot faster
than we will by ourselves.

163
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,560
All right, I get you.

164
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,960
You train real hard, now!

165
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,000
Please see this through.

166
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,000
Hang in there!

167
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,970
Right!

168
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,180
This is unmistakably the work of Cell.

169
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,920
So then his plan is to attack
people for their life energy,

170
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,950
and store it up for himself!

171
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,930
Not much time has passed since
this happened, he must still be nearby.

172
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,990
Why don't we go check?

173
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,140
Do you sense anything?

174
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,140
N-No...

175
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,980
<i>Damn...</i>

176
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,160
Over there!

177
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,170
It's slight, but there's a disturbance
in <i>ki</i> coming from over there!

178
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,830
You're right!

179
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,850
That city!

180
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,700
Damn, we're too late! He's a quick one!

181
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,340
T-There's nothing we can do like this!

182
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,510
Cell feels our <i>ki</i>, and quickly runs away.

183
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:56,420
And if we hold our <i>ki</i>, we can't go very fast!

184
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,570
Useless, useless!

185
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,570
While they're prowling around down there,

186
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:23,100
I think I'll go get my next meal!

187
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,580
So you're saying you
want us to find a weakness

188
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,920
in No. 17 and the others with these plans,

189
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,980
in order to prevent Cell
from merging with them.

190
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,390
These are incredible.

191
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:41,930
There's quite a few things
here not even I understand.

192
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,970
What a shame. If only Doctor Gero
had applied his genius a better way,

193
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,970
the world could be at peace.

194
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,940
From a human base,

195
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,410
he's been almost entirely remodeled
with just organic components.

196
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,780
In which case, at a cellular level,

197
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,410
uniting the two is a definite possibility!

198
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,120
I won't know until I look over these thoroughly,

199
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,820
but these sparsely-used, small devices
here may be an unexpected weakness.

200
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,490
We'll start investigating
these right away, Kuririn<i>-kun.</i>

201
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,030
Right! If you would be so kind!

202
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,790
Are we there yet, No. 16?

203
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:52,460
Is it still a long way to Son Goku's house?

204
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,970
Almost there.

205
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,380
<i>Seeking his perfect form,</i>

206
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:10,410
<i>the monster Cell attacks</i>
<i>one person after another!</i>

207
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:26,560
<i>Can his merging with No. 17</i>
<i>and No. 18 really be prevented?</i>

208
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,400
<i>And what of Goku?</i>

209
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,520
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

210
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,360
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

211
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,730
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

212
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,230
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

213
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,740
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

214
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,850
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

215
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,350
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

216
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,990
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

217
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:29,500
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

218
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,600
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

219
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,400
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

220
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,440
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

221
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,110
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

222
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,280
<i>So sorry.</i>

223
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,420
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

224
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,430
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

225
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,240
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

226
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,440
<i>I know I've worried you all,</i>
<i>but I'm all right now.</i>

227
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,610
<i>Now we have to do something about Cell, quick!</i>

228
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:21,510
<i>Goku-sa! You've just recovered,</i>
<i>and you want to fight already?!</i>

229
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,110
<i>You've gotta be kiddin' me!</i>

230
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,020
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

231
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,850
<i>"Goku Awakens to Battle!</i>

232
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,630
<i>Hooray! Father is all better!</i>

233
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,120
"Next time"
"Goku Awakens to Battle!
Go Beyond Super Saiyan!!"
