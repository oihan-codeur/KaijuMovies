<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,210
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

29
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,780
<i>At last, Vegeta prepared himself for death,</i>

In order to defeat you,

32
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,680
I'm going to make sure
you can't restore yourself,

33
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,060

37
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,100
Vegeta!

38
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,980
Vegeta!

39
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,070
Piccolo!

40
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,280
It's too late! That's the mark
of Vegeta's life burning out!

41
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,910
You said it yourself, didn't you?
That Vegeta is laying down his life,

42
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,280
and for the first time,
fighting for someone else?

43
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,440
Videl-<i>san</i>, you're sure that Gohan and
Goten went off to where these horrible

44
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,650
Madoshi and Majin Boo guys
you were talkin' about are, right?

45
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,650
Yes.

46
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:15,530
Gohan aside, how come
you didn't stop Goten for me?

47
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,200
I blame you for this, Videl-<i>san</i>!

48
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,790
I'm sorry. I never would have thought
that Goten and Trunks would go too.

49
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,210
Videl, don't worry about it too much.

50
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,970
After all, those two little
urchins aren't the kind to listen

51
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,640
to what you would have told them anyhow.

52
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,470
Moreover, Goku and the others are with them.

53
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,970
There's nothing to worry about!

54
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,850
Right.

55
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,690
That aside, you're sure this is the right way?

56
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,690
Yes. They should be way in front of us.

57
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:48,110
All right! I'm speeding up!

58
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,710
<i>Why... Why would Vegeta do such a thing?</i>

59
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,550
Vegeta!

60
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,890
Impossible!

61
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,940
It can't be!

62
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:33,900
It's not so! There's some
kind of mistake! Vegeta...!

63
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,120
<i>For him to do something,</i>
<i>like killing that many people...</i>

64
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,420
Bulma, don't worry so much about it!

65
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,960
The Dragon Balls are meant for times like this!

66
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,630
It's okay! Everyone who died
can be brought back to life!

67
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,930
That's not the problem here, is it?!

68
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,060
Hey now, no crying!

69
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,060
Hey! Fly this thing right!

70
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,060
Sorry, sorry!

71
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,240
Y-You know, at the time, there
was something strange about Vegeta.

72
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,620
He was filled with the same kind of evil Vegeta
had back in the past when he was so terrible.

73
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,000
Yup! He wasn't normal!

74
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,500
<i>I wonder if he's returned to being the</i>
<i>Vegeta he was when he first came to Earth.</i>

75
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,990
Hey! Didn't I just tell
you to fly this thing right?!

76
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,990
It's not my fault!

77
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,200
Damn! What the hell is this?

78
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,160
It's like the whole sky is being pulled apart!

79
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,380
What was that just now?!

80
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,430
A great explosion went off
somewhere in the distance.

81
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,560
<i>What's this? My heart is trembling...</i>

82
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,110
<i>I-It can't be! Vegeta...!</i>

83
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,200
I-It's no use! It looks like that
shock gave us engine trouble!

84
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,660
I can't control it!

85
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,450
What?!

86
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,130
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, do something!

87
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,090
Dammit!

88
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,810
I-It's no good!

89
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,900
I'm leaving her with you!

90
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,470
What happened?

91
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,150
Vegeta...

92
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,180
Vegeta's <i>ki</i> has completely vanished.

93
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,360
Kuririn, take these two
back to their homes for me.

94
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,990
I'm going to go see how it turned out.

95
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,360
I'm going too!

96
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,870
That's right, there's nothing I can do by going.

97
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,510
Be careful!

98
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,270
Kuririn, it won't do for me
to keep quiet about this...

99
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,570
Afterward, tell the family.

100
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,570
Tell them... what?

101
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:12,120
I don't know about Goku, but Gohan...

102
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,410
Gohan has already been
killed by Majin Boo, it seems.

103
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,420
Y-You're kidding!

104
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,750
That's what I heard. Vegeta said so.

105
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,010
–I leave it to you.
–H-Hey!

106
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:40,940
It can't be... Even Gohan? How do I tell them?

107
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,340
Yamucha, what was that blast back there?

108
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,510
I'm not sure. It was an
incredible blast, wasn't it?

109
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:18,470
Ah, thanks to No. 18-<i>san</i>, we've been saved!

110
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,960
This is incredible.

111
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,600
Vegeta...

112
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
<i>So that's it.</i>

113
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,600
<i>However much damage he takes on,</i>
<i>Majin Boo can regenerate himself.</i>

114
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,980
<i>You've blown him into so many</i>
<i>pieces as to keep him from doing so.</i>

115
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,320
<i>Vegeta... you've sacrificed your very self...</i>

116
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,620
<i>For the first time, you fought</i>
<i>for someone else, and died.</i>

117
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,460
<i>You've extinguished yourself...</i>
<i>For you to die, and leave nothing behind...</i>

118
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,750
<i>A fitting end for the high pride of Vegeta...</i>

119
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,760
<i>We've been saved by him, have we?</i>

120
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,530
D-Damn...

121
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,160
Babidi!

122
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,000
Hmph! Still alive, are you?

123
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,340
As weak as you are, you sure are persistent!

124
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,010
Looks like you survived
this with your barrier.

125
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,010
M-Majin Boo...!

126
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,890
Struggle around, will you?
I'm going to finish you off!

127
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,480
What?

128
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,320
The fragments from Majin Boo...!

129
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,790
W-What?!

130
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,780
I-Impossible!

131
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,340
<i>How can this be?! Majin Boo is alive!</i>

132
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,860
B-Boo...!

133
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,200
Majin Boo...!

134
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,330
You been buried?

135
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,370
N-No, no! Look closely! Closely!

136
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:40,340
What happened to your feet?

137
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,180
Never mind about that, quickly, quickly...!

138
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,720
You'd think they'd be kind
of important, though, huh?

139
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,230
H-Hey! Return me back to normal!

140
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:56,060
Back to normal?

141
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:00,070
You should be able to do it!
Hurry up! I'll die, you know!

142
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,110
No reason I couldn't do it...!

143
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,700
What are you doing?! Do it now!

144
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,290
I could do it...

145
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,290
Do you want to get sealed up again?!

146
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,170
Hurry and do it!

147
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:41,190
All right, nice work, Majin Boo.

148
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:51,320
But then again, those bastards!
They're the ones who did this to me!

149
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:01,250
That green guy and those two runts!
You're absolutely going to pay for this!

150
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,960
I won't wipe out this whole planet at once!

151
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,260
I'm going to make you suffer!

152
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,550
We'll show them how terrible
Babidi-<i>sama</i> and Majin Boo are!

153
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Being on the ground is too dangerous!

154
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,120
We're taking these two to Kami's palace!

155
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,580
Piccolo! What do you mean?
What happened to Vegeta?

156
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,960
What happened to Majin Boo?

157
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,920
Piccolo, d-don't tell me...!

158
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,430
Majin Boo has survived.

159
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,140
Th-That can't be! What about Vegeta?

160
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,810
Not even a trace.

161
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:01,810
Which means, you're saying
Vegeta died for nothing?!

162
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,440
In any case, we're taking
these two to Kami's palace.

163
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,980
Y-Yeah...

164
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,490
Our only star of hope now is these two...

165
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,660
faint hope though that might be.

166
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,010
We're turning this planet to hell, Majin Boo!

167
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:42,060
Until those guys show themselves,
kill everyone there is! Kill! Kill!

168
00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:01,580
Gohan-<i>san</i>... Please... please be alive...!

169
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:14,510
<i>Madoshi Babidi and Majin Boo</i>
<i>have both been restored.</i>

170
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:19,680
<i>However, it is undetermined whether Gohan,</i>
<i>who Kaioshin is relying on, is alive or dead.</i>

171
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:28,400
<i>Is there any remaining</i>
<i>means of resisting Boo now?</i>

172
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,820
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

173
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,410
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

174
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,970
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

175
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:02,060
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

176
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:09,070
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

177
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:14,440
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

178
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:18,320
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

179
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

180
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,920
<i>Even now?</i>

181
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:36,590
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

182
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,970
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

183
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:48,440
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

184
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:58,490
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

185
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,550
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

186
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:18,380
<i>This is bad. Gohan and Vegeta ain't around,</i>

187
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,800
<i>and Boo has started running wild.</i>

188
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,890
<i>One more to go, and we'll have</i>
<i>all the Dragon Balls collected.</i>

189
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,480
<i>Ah! What do we do?! The Dragon Ball</i>
<i>is inside that monster's tummy!</i>

190
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,650
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

191
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:33,270
<i>"The Struggle of Videl and the Others!</i>
<i>Find the Dragon Balls."</i>

192
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,360
<i>Guys, don't do anything</i>
<i>too crazy while I'm not around!</i>

193
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,610
"Next time"
"The Struggle of Videl and the Others!
Find the Dragon Balls"
