<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,970
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,290
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,660
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:04,670
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,650
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:26,600
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,170
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,690
<i>Namek counts down its last</i>
<i>moments before destruction...</i>

17
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,840
<i>Right in the middle of it all,</i>

18
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,840
<i>the life-and-death battle between Freeza,</i>
<i>the strongest being in the universe,</i>

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,050
<i>and Son Goku, who has become a</i>
<i>Super Saiyan, continues to unfold.</i>

20
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,000
There ain't any time!
Let's finish this right now!

21
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,820
How's that?

22
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,690
Those were just my warm-up
exercises for my final attack!

23
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,000
I would suppose so.

24
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,340
At that level, they'd have to be.

25
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,610
<i>The battle continues...</i>

26
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,380
<i>"Shen Long, Run Yourself Through Space!!</i>
<i>The Time of Namek's Destruction Draws Near."</i>

27
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,710
Enough with the false bravado!

28
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,830
The only thing that remains for you is death!

29
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,060
Before you die, there is
one point I will praise you for.

30
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,000
Your superb, incredible
strength, Super Saiyan.

31
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,670
It's certainly the greatest in the universe.

32
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,370
If only I, Freeza, weren't around!

33
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,730
Miserable idiot!

34
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,360
If you had only beaten Freeza
before he attained full power,

35
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,370
this wouldn't be happening.

36
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,800
Kaio<i>-sama</i>? Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

37
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,370
This is the Kami over Earth. Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

38
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,380
I hear you. Something I can do?

39
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,650
I have just received word from Mister Popo.

40
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,050
He has located where the last Dragon Ball is.

41
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,390
Yes, and...?

42
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,060
Ah, right. Very shortly, all
seven will be gathered together,

43
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,730
and so we will be resurrecting
Tenshinhan and Yamucha there with you.

44
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,070
Ah, that's right.

45
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:38,050
But, as I said earlier,
unfortunately for Chaozu...

46
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,680
Don't worry, Chaozu.

47
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,980
I will remain here too.

48
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,020
We're always together, aren't we?

49
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,020
You can't! Ten<i>-san</i>, that won't do!

50
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,360
If you guys are going to remain here,
then as far as I'm concerned...

51
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,990
What are you saying?!

52
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,030
You have Bulma waiting for you, don't you?

53
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,370
Y-Yeah, but...

54
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:06,370
Wait a second! Hold on, hold on!

55
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:13,040
Say, Kami of Earth, can those Dragon
Balls resurrect two people at the same time?

56
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,710
Hm? Er, yes, so long as the
conditions are the same. For example,

57
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,810
as we are to ask this time,

58
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,720
"Please return to life those who
were killed by Vegeta and his group–"

59
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,350
So long as the request
is made in this manner,

60
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,690
it will likely work on any number of people.

61
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:31,360
Then even with only the one wish,
they surpass Planet Namek's Dragon Balls.

62
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,370
Okay then, can the wish be granted
even on worlds far separated from Earth?

63
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,370
Mm, probably. Why do you ask such a thing?

64
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,840
You can't be thinking of bringing
back to life all the aliens Vegeta

65
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,040
has ever killed in the past, can you?

66
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,350
Naturally, such a thing is possible,

67
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:56,450
but it would only be effective for
those who had died within one year's time.

68
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,060
There's just one more thing I'd like to ask.

69
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,390
Can those who died having lived the
full measure of their life be resurrected?

70
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,360
Unfortunately, that is impossible.
In the event of a natural death...

71
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,370
But what about the case of someone who met
with evil beings, and even though indirectly,

72
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:18,370
had their life's measure reduced as a result?

73
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,050
A good question indeed.
This is a first-time case.

74
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,520
But I believe they would be
able to live for the portion of time

75
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,360
that had been shortened from their measure.

76
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,030
I have no proof of such, however.

77
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,070
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what is it?

78
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,240
All right, it's decided then!
Kami, change that wish for me!

79
00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:00,350
Make it, "Please return to life all
those killed by Freeza and his ring," okay?

80
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,060
Aren't we to Son<i>-kun</i>'s spaceship yet?

81
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,500
If we don't get off this dangerous
planet as soon as possible,

82
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,070
we'll never set foot on
the soil of Earth again!

83
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,700
Yes, I know that.

84
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,340
You're really sure about that?

85
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,740
Yet you don't even know how
hard I had to struggle up until now!

86
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,410
But I do know.

87
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,350
It was so awful, after all!
Being chased by dinosaurs,

88
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,020
getting changed into a frog,
almost getting pinched by giant rocks...!

89
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,700
There it is! That's it!
That's Father's spaceship!

90
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,700
Hooray! Now we can return to Earth!

91
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,390
Hey, hold on! Where are
you going on your own?!

92
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,840
The lifespan of this planet is nearly up.

93
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,850
Two or three minutes left at the outside.

94
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:42,720
You must be getting
anxious, eh Super Saiyan?

95
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,030
So that's it, you're buying time, are you?

96
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,230
Enough for that kid and
the others to leave this planet?

97
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, that's okay.

98
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,840
I may let them go now, but
I will make them my next target.

99
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,000
Their deaths will only be slightly delayed.

100
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,540
Buying time, did you say?
I don't have the need to!

101
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,380
You're going to die. Here and now.

102
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,540
That's enough of your big talk!

103
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,410
I'm going to shut you up right now!

104
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,680
<i>What's taking so long for</i>
<i>Gohan and the others? Get moving!</i>

105
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Killed by Freeza and his ring, you say?
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what is this about?

106
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,800
There isn't any time, so I'll explain this simply.

107
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,130
First, we use the Dragon Balls on Earth

108
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,440
to return to life those killed by Freeza
and his men, meaning the Namekians.

109
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,110
By doing so, it is likely that
the Grand Elder of Planet Namek

110
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:55,440
will be resurrected, however briefly.

111
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,280
From that point, I'm not too
sure this is going to work myself,

112
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,620
but of the Namekian Dragon Balls'
three wishes, only two have been granted.

113
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,460
Once the Grand Elder is returned to life,

114
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,460
there should be one more wish
to be granted, shouldn't there?

115
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,800
A-And then?

116
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,530
With that one wish,

117
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,140
instantaneously relocate all those on
Planet Namek, with the exception of Freeza,

118
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,840
to someplace like Earth!

119
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,080
I-I see. That is one possible gamble, isn't it?

120
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,080
You guys' resurrections
will be considerably delayed.

121
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,420
Can you put up with that for us?

122
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,090
I can't return to life in the first place, so...

123
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,930
Of course, that will be fine with me!

124
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,430
It's only one year, isn't it?

125
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,460
It is an excellent idea you have, Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

126
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,200
And that's that. Now
pardon me, but you must hurry!

127
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,080
The very planet Namek itself
is just about to be vaporized!

128
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,490
Is that so? Very well, I will tell
this to Mister Popo right away.

129
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,120
Bulma<i>-san</i>, come inside, quick!

130
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,620
What's going on? It's pitch black in here!

131
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,960
What's wrong?

132
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,160
It can't be malfunctioning, can it–?

133
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,430
That's strange. When I was
here earlier, the lights were on.

134
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,800
W-Watch out!

135
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,500
The floor is slanted.

136
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm not familiar with this
thing, but I'll try this and that.

137
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,640
Could this be it?

138
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,160
I-Isn't that Piccolo over there?!

139
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,830
Yes, it is.

140
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,130
What's he doing in a place like this?

141
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,510
I don't want to journey through
space together with someone like Piccolo!

142
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,620
Piccolo<i>-san</i> helped save me and Father,

143
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,150
so I am going to be sure
to take him back to Earth!

144
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,860
You know, Gohan<i>-kun,</i>
this is Piccolo's homeland.

145
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,200
I wonder if he wouldn't
rather like to stay here.

146
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,900
O-Okay, already!

147
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,410
<i>Well, what else can I do?</i>

148
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:14,610
<i>He's unconscious and all, so</i>
<i>there's nothing to worry about, right?</i>

149
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,150
<i>What?!</i>

150
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,280
We've reached the limit!

151
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,650
If we stay here any longer,
we won't be able to take off!

152
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,330
You can't! Father still hasn't come!

153
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,130
Son<i>-kun</i> will be fine!

154
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,840
He's sure to escape somehow or other!

155
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,180
Please, Bulma<i>-san</i>! For Father!
Wait for Father, please!

156
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,310
Just one more minute will be enough!

157
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,650
G-Gohan<i>-kun...</i>

158
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,810
Hold out against this,
Piccolo! If you and I die now,

159
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:02,180
all hope will disappear as well!

160
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,520
Kami<i>-sama</i>! Kami<i>-sama</i>!

161
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,760
Kami<i>-sama</i>, Dragon Balls gathered.
Can say wish any time.

162
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,890
Very well!

163
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,460
So, speak forth thy wish!
I shall grant thee any one wish!

164
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,900
Um, want to have those killed by
Freeza and his men returned to life.

165
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,670
This on distant planet.
Can you grant this wish?

166
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,770
I know not. However, I shall try.

167
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:43,110
Not know is trouble. Can only have do.

168
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,980
Request this. Good luck.

169
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:06,170
Go to hell, Freeza!

170
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,140
<i>What will be the outcome of this,</i>
<i>the greatest conflict in the universe?</i>

171
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,840
<i>And will the wish to Shen Long be granted?</i>

172
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
<i>There is no more time remaining!</i>

173
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,580
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

174
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,420
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

175
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,790
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

176
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,290
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

177
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,800
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

178
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,900
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

179
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

180
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,040
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

181
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,550
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,650
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

183
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,460
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

184
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,490
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

185
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:45,170
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

186
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,340
<i>So sorry.</i>

187
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,470
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

188
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,480
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

189
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,060
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

190
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,630
<i>There's only three minutes</i>
<i>until the planet explodes!</i>

191
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,900
<i>Shen Long, hurry up and bring the</i>
<i>people on Planet Namek back to life!</i>

192
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,800
<i>This is hopeless now!</i>

193
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,040
<i>Gohan-kun, let's get out</i>
<i>of here as fast as we can!</i>

194
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,140
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

195
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:31,480
<i>"I Am Son Goku's Son!!</i>
<i>Gohan Returns to the Battlefield."</i>

196
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,760
<i>Freeza, now you'll have to take me on!</i>

197
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,190
"Next time"
"I Am Son Goku's Son!!
Gohan Returns to the Battlefield"
