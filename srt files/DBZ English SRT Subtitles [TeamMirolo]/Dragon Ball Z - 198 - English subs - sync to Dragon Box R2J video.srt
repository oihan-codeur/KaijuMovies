<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:24,300
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,310
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:42,900
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:51,780
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,290
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:04,300
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,850
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,270
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:26,240
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,780
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,660
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,580
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,320
<i>Following a difficult battle,</i>

17
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,330
<i>Goku advanced his way into the</i>
<i>semifinals of the Anoyoichi Tournament,</i>

18
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,370
<i>where he took in the spectacular</i>
<i>battle between Paikuhan and Olivue,</i>

19
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,170
<i>which stoked his fighting spirit even higher.</i>

20
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,190
C-Contestant Paikuhan wins!

21
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,130
T-To think that I could fight
against someone that strong...!

22
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,680
<i>"Final Round of Flame!!</i>
<i>Goku or Paikuhan!?"</i>

23
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,750
Go get him, Goku! Shock
him with a good hard slam!

24
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,790
Malaiko! No need to hold back!

25
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,710
With your power, that
guy will be a piece of cake!

26
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,670
Ah, that newcomer even
made it into the semifinals!

27
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,260
Yeah. But it could be too
much for even him this time.

28
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,100
Nah, you never know.

29
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,680
He could just be the first
person from the North Galaxy

30
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,690
to receive training from Grand Kaio-<i>sama.</i>

31
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,100
You can't mean that.

32
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,980
We will now begin the first
match of the semifinal round

33
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,450
of the Kaio of the North Dying
Commemorative Anoyoichi Tournament!

34
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:03,370
Contestant Malaiko,
Contestant Goku, please begin!

35
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,280
<i>He's dodging everything</i>
<i>by just a hairsbreadth.</i>

36
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,510
Oh, dear! Contestant Goku has
been knocked high into the air!

37
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,260
After being sent flying
like this... Ah, watch out!

38
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,430
...can he still be all right?!

39
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,480
<i>All right! This is how I'll finish the match!</i>

40
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,160
W-What?!

41
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,350
Malaiko!

42
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,810
Goku!

43
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,690
Here it goes!

44
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,610
Take this!

45
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,550
Where could Contestant Malaiko have gone?!

46
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,310
There you are!

47
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,300
C-Contestant Malaiko is out of bounds!

48
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,970
Contestant Son Goku
advances to the final round!

49
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,310
Goku! Well done! That was great!

50
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,830
<i>That kid definitely has a lot</i>
<i>more power than when we first met.</i>

51
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,710
<i>Don't tell me he's advanced</i>
<i>that much in this short a time...</i>

52
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you!

53
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,340
<i>I look forward to this.</i>

54
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,020
S-So, Goku has advanced to the final round.

55
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,440
The victory is well within his reach now.

56
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,060
You fool!

57
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,690
What?!

58
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:03,320
Get yourself all worked up now, while you can,

59
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,690
you hardheaded old dimwit.

60
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,900
W-What?!

61
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,280
Listen, your kid might have
been lucky enough to win this time,

62
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,500
but in the final round, he's going to
have to fight against my galaxy's Paikuhan!

63
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,540
There's no way he can win!

64
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,290
That's not so. It's only
natural that Goku is going to win.

65
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,510
I know well just how strong he is.

66
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,010
What are you talking about?!
The winner is going to be Paikuhan!

67
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,010
Goku!

68
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,930
Paikuhan!

69
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:37,930
–Goku! Goku! Goku!
–Paikuhan! Paikuhan! Paikuhan!

70
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,410
If you're willing to go
that far, shall we bet on it?

71
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,620
Bet on it?

72
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,910
If, by some slim chance that Paikuhan loses,

73
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,830
I will give you my West Kaio's World.

74
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,210
What? Your Kaio's World?

75
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,470
Yeah. And, if Goku loses,
what will you do? Hmm?

76
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,590
A-All right, I'll give you
my North Kaio's World...

77
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:16,010
Huh? It's not there anymore, is it?

78
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,600
W-What will you do?

79
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,810
W-Well, that is, I...

80
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,360
So that's it, you don't have
enough confidence, do you?

81
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,440
T-That's ridiculous!

82
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:32,450
A-All right, if Goku loses, I'll become
your servant, or whatever you want.

83
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,790
That's rich! All right, if Goku
loses, then for as long as you live...

84
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,580
...but then again, you've already died...

85
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,380
but anyhow, you'll be my servant. Okay?

86
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,090
Of course! A Kaio doesn't go back on his word!

87
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,170
That was a good match!

88
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,640
Thank you. But you know...

89
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,430
But? But what?

90
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,480
What was that just now?!

91
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,560
That was the sound of my stomach.

92
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,070
Terrific! That's just like you, Goku-<i>chan</i>!

93
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,240
I just asked to have a big
spread be put together over there.

94
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,210
All right! I'm saved!

95
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,210
Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

96
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,290
Just a minute!

97
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,380
What is it, Kaio of the North?

98
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,680
This is no time to be eating.

99
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,350
Are you sure you don't want
to watch Paikuhan's next match?

100
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,850
Moving on to the next match...

101
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,180
Contestant Tolbee versus...

102
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,940
Contestant Paikuhan!

103
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,870
It's okay, it's okay.

104
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,870
Okay...? You mean it?

105
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:07,040
What an insolent kid!

106
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,050
After all, I already know who's going to win.

107
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,170
You say you already know?

108
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,890
How in the world...?

109
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,060
Never mind that, let's eat! Let's eat!

110
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,680
Wow! I'll help myself!

111
00:12:52,420 --> 00:13:02,430
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

112
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,730
Come on! What's with this shoddy running?!

113
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,230
For crying out loud, not one of
you made it through to the semifinals!

114
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,070
Now I've got mud smeared on my face!

115
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,820
If you keep running this lethargically,

116
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,110
I'll increase your
punishment a hundredfold!

117
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,830
What were you guys thinking, for pity's sake?!

118
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,890
Okay.

119
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,230
Okay.

120
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,200
Paikuhan is the winner!

121
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,510
A-And so, the time for
the final round has arrived!

122
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,180
In the final round,
representing the West Galaxy,

123
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,600
Contestant Paikuhan!

124
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,360
Facing him will be,
representing the North Galaxy,

125
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,530
Contestant Son Goku!

126
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,530
Contestant Son Goku, if you are
present, please enter the ring at once!

127
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,830
No more helpings! Is this
any time to be taking it so easy?!

128
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,080
It's the final round! You're on!

129
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,000
What's this? Contestant Son Goku was eating!

130
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,840
For the love of... he's
trying to make fools of us!

131
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:05,180
Just a second! I ain't
finished yet! I ain't finished!

132
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,810
<i>Is he sure of himself, or is he just plain stupid?</i>

133
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,810
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

134
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,190
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

135
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,450
It looks like the final round is beginning.

136
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,780
You guys keep going!

137
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,410
If you slack off, you'll answer to me!

138
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,850
Go, go, West! Go, go, Paikuhan!
"West"

139
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:59,650
Very well then, please begin!

140
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,210
W-Why ain't you dodging me?

141
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,670
So that's it.

142
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:25,760
You're saying you don't even
need to dodge my punches, huh?

143
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,850
Still, I wasn't going at
you seriously just now, either.

144
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,430
I doubt you were!

145
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,590
<i>All right...!</i>

146
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,020
Paikuhan! You'll fall out of the ring! Be careful!

147
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,070
Goku! Get him once and for all!

148
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,110
<i>Not too bad.</i>

149
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,050
Is that the extent of your power, Goku?

150
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:11,470
What?

151
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,050
If so, I'll start going at you, as well!

152
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,020
<i>I can't push him back!</i>

153
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,110
<i>T-That's impossible!</i>

154
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,810
You're better than I thought, Goku.

155
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,810
That goes double for me.
I'm so happy, I'm all keyed up!

156
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,780
Oh, my!

157
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,200
Paikuhan has started to take off his gown!
What exactly could he be up to?!

158
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,430
<i>I-Is this...?</i>

159
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:51,650
I get it. So you were only
warming up just now, were you?

160
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,950
There's something about
you that's a lot like Piccolo.

161
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,370
Piccolo?

162
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:05,370
Yeah. He's a martial artist that got
me all worked up too, like you have.

163
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,720
<i>You're pretty good.</i>

164
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:31,270
In that case, me too...

165
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:58,510
Okay, let's hurry up and get going again.

166
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:09,480
<i>I-Incredibly, Paikuhan</i>
<i>was not using his true power.</i>

167
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,100
<i>And neither was Goku!</i>

168
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:19,240
<i>The true power of both Goku, having</i>
<i>become a Super Saiyan, and Paikuhan...</i>

169
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,490
<i>Which one of them will be victorious?</i>

170
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:48,390
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

171
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,230
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

172
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,610
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

173
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,110
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

174
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,620
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

175
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,710
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

176
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,260
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

177
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,880
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

178
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,390
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

179
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,480
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

180
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,270
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

181
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,320
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

182
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,990
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

183
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,160
<i>So sorry.</i>

184
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,290
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

185
00:23:55,040 --> 00:24:00,290
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

186
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,560
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

187
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,270
<i>Damn, Paikuhan's attacks</i>
<i>are too fast for me to see.</i>

188
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:21,230
<i>He can also evade my Kamehame-Ha,</i>
<i>even head-on! What do I do?</i>

189
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,360
<i>Goku, what are you doing?</i>

190
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,610
<i>If you don't win, I'm ruined!</i>

191
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,740
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

192
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,450
<i>"Don't Let Victory Get Away!!</i>
<i>Finish With an Ultra-Fast Kamehame-Ha."</i>

193
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,040
<i>When it comes to guts, Father definitely wins!</i>

194
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,920
"Next time"
"Don't Let Victory Get Away!!
Finish With an Ultra-Fast Kamehame-Ha"
