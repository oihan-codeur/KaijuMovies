<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,065
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,705
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>Majin Boo has strength beyond imagination.</i>

24
00:02:04,735 --> 00:02:07,865
<i>In the face of this strength,</i>
<i>Kaioshin and Gohan,</i>

25
00:02:07,905 --> 00:02:11,245
<i>unable to take any action, were beaten.</i>

26

D-Dabura!

27
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:28,755
Babidi-<i>sama</i>, he... Majin Boo is by no means

28
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:32,845
the kind of guy who will
be a loyal follower of yours!

29
00:02:40,815 --> 00:02:44,025

If I break this cover and go through,
I'll be in Babidi's spaceship.

33
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:40,245
I should be able to reach Majin Boo's location
quickly if I demolish the spaceship. Most likely.

34
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:46,795
Gohan's <i>ki</i> has already disappeared, huh?

35
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:49,635
Forgive me. It's my fault.

36
00:03:57,345 --> 00:03:58,685
Kakarrot...

37
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,335
I'm gonna eat'cha!

38
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,585
E-Eat me, you say?

39
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:51,865
What?!

40
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:53,865
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

41
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:57,325
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna
eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

42
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:01,075
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

43
00:05:02,915 --> 00:05:08,835
Aw, that's okay! So long as Majin Boo is
revived, I have no more use for Dabura!

44
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:14,215
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

45
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:15,345
Dammit!

46
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:17,885
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

47
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,595
Why you!

48
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:33,905
Majin Boo!

49
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:40,655
How about that, Majin?!

50
00:06:04,685 --> 00:06:09,935
Great! Great, Majin Boo!

51
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:16,655
I'm gonna eat'cha!

52
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:19,025
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

53
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:40,175
That guy's <i>ki</i> is getting bigger and bigger, fast!

54
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:46,145
All right then, how about this?!

55
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:28,055
After that, no matter the
Majin he may have been...

56
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:33,065
I-Impossible! The Majin! I-It can't be!

57
00:07:38,105 --> 00:07:41,235
You got him, didn't you?

58
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:45,075
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

59
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,575
W-What?!

60
00:07:51,075 --> 00:08:01,255
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

61
00:08:05,715 --> 00:08:10,605
That's every bit my Majin!
All right! Get him good, Majin Boo!

62
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:13,355
Gonna eat'cha! Gonna eat'cha!

63
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,445
You turn into a cookie!!

64
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:17,205
Magnificent! Magnificent!

65
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,665
Nice going, Majin Boo!

66
00:09:24,135 --> 00:09:28,635
He ate him! That guy turned
him into a cookie and ate him!

67
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,225
Y-Yeah...

68
00:09:41,695 --> 00:09:43,275
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

69
00:09:44,695 --> 00:09:47,035
You guys!

70
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:49,155
What are you guys doing here?

71
00:09:49,195 --> 00:09:50,535
Huh?

72
00:09:50,575 --> 00:09:53,165
Yet up until just a moment ago,
you were a stone mannequin!

73
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:55,375
A stone mannequin?

74
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:01,125
That's right! I was spat upon
by that guy with the horns–

75
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:05,175
Dabura or whatever–-and turned into stone!

76
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:08,175
I'm back to normal.

77
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:11,175
I wonder, could that be
the guy who was just eaten?

78
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:12,895
That's it, that's it!

79
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:17,105
Since that guy died, Kuririn-<i>san</i>
returned back to normal, didn't he?

80
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:25,195
I'm g-going to go look at something.

81
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:27,075
What's the matter?

82
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:31,155
Trunks-<i>kun</i> knocked over
Piccolo-<i>san</i>'s mannequin and broke it.

83
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,015
Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

84
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:54,015
Y-You'd better not look.

85
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:55,555
T-Trunks, did you–

86
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:59,395
P-Please, keep this from
everybody, okay? Okay?

87
00:10:59,435 --> 00:11:00,935
Keep what from everybody?!

88
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:18,415
W-What is it?! This terrible <i>ki</i>?! I-Is it him?

89
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:20,995
Don't tell me it's Majin Boo!

90
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:27,585
Say, Piccolo-<i>san</i>? How did
you get back to normal? Huh?

91
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:31,095
As long as my head is
unharmed, I can regenerate.

92
00:11:31,135 --> 00:11:34,595
But never mind that, tell me
what the hell is going on here!

93
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:36,595
Where are Goku and the others?!

94
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:40,605
I don't know! We just barely got here too.

95
00:11:40,645 --> 00:11:43,605
Hey, what is that strange guy over there?

96
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:46,605
Is he that M-Majin Boo guy?!

97
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:47,985
Probably.

98
00:11:48,025 --> 00:11:52,615
Y-You've gotta be kidding me!

99
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:56,365
Th-This terrible <i>ki</i> belongs to him, right?!

100
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:03,455
I know! Majin Boo!

101
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:06,335
Him too! Eat up Kaioshin too!

102
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:16,095
Is that Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?!

103
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,475
Hey, stop, Piccolo!

104
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:19,645
If you go out there,
what do you plan on doing?!

105
00:12:19,685 --> 00:12:24,475
Be patient! I know how you feel,
but you have to be patient!

106
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:29,025
Frankly, he's an opponent not even
you can match up against! That's for sure!

107
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:31,775
He was stabbed through with a spear,
but it was no big deal to him!

108
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:34,275
And he turns his opponents
into candy and eats them!

109
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:44,165
What am I gonna turn you into to eat?

110
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,755
Maybe choco? Maybe jelly drops?

111
00:12:49,045 --> 00:12:53,215
What a tragic end, for someone such as yourself!

112
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:08,525
W-What?!

113
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:27,455
What?! What?!

114
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:06,455
M-My spaceship!!

115
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:16,425
I-It can't be!

116
00:14:16,465 --> 00:14:21,265
Dammit, dammit, dammit!
What's the meaning of this?!

117
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:29,185
Hey, Majin Boo, do you know
who did such an awful thing?

118
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:41,285
Is someone there?

119
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:52,965
Y-You're...!

120
00:14:53,005 --> 00:14:53,965
Yo!

121
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:54,965
It's Papa!

122
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,505
Vegeta?

123
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:11,185
Vegeta, what are you doing here?

124
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:20,485
Vegeta-<i>san...</i>

125
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:28,995
Y-You don't mean, you're the
one who destroyed my spaceship?!

126
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:34,375
Yeah. It was a bit rough of me,
but I used it as a shortcut.

127
00:15:34,415 --> 00:15:36,465
Vegeta! Why you...!

128
00:15:36,505 --> 00:15:42,015
H-How come?! You were never
ordered to destroy the spaceship, right?!

129
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:45,135
Indeed! Why can't you
listen to what you're told?!

130
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:48,015
I've never seen anybody like you!

131
00:15:52,395 --> 00:15:56,315
Is that uncomely,
ridiculous-looking guy Majin Boo?!

132
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:03,115
Why, you... How dare you kill Gohan!

133
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:13,545
S-So, what did Papa say?

134
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:15,915
Piccolo!

135
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:18,715
<i>G-Gohan...</i>

136
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:27,385
Un-come-ly?

137
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:30,395
What's that? What's that?

138
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:33,645
He means you're ugly,
that you have a strange face!

139
00:16:51,785 --> 00:16:54,295
Hey, now!

140
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,245
Majin Boo!

141
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:13,605
Such a pleasant fellow!

142
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:20,695
Now I'm mad! Gonna kill ya! Gonna kill ya!

143
00:17:25,825 --> 00:17:27,945
Rotten Vegeta! Fine!

144
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:29,655
Majin Boo, get him!

145
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:33,495
He defies me like crazy, so I'm done with him!

146
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:41,425
Hey, that monstrous freak
just made his <i>ki</i> even larger!

147
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:42,795
What kind of guy is this?

148
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:46,135
Papa! Give it to that Majin!

149
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:49,675
Vegeta...

150
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:19,495
Kill him, Majin Boo! Kill Vegeta!

151
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:36,815
<i>Kakarrot...</i>

152
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:41,275
<i>You were someone who</i>
<i>entirely grated on my nerves.</i>

153
00:18:51,235 --> 00:18:54,705
<i>Not only did you always</i>
<i>stay one step ahead of me,</i>

154
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:57,625
<i>but after you ended up saving my life...</i>

155
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:01,545
<i>...you died on me!</i>

156
00:19:02,545 --> 00:19:04,255
<i>However,</i>

157
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:08,385
<i>this one time, I'm going to settle things.</i>

158
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:34,905
<i>You have a good, long sleep.</i>

159
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:37,915
<i>When you awake, everything will likely be over.</i>

160
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:40,745
<i>Though I may not be around.</i>

161
00:19:48,925 --> 00:19:51,715
I'm not going to hell alone!

162
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,635
I'm taking you all with me!

163
00:19:58,935 --> 00:20:02,815
Th-This won't do! Vegeta-<i>san</i> is intent on dying!

164
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,835
Papa's awesome!

165
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:16,215
This just might be–just possibly might be it!

166
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:19,425
W-What power!

167
00:21:54,925 --> 00:22:01,345
This can't mean...! Boo! Majin Boo!

168
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:04,765
Way to go, Papa! Give it to him! Give it to him!

169
00:22:08,765 --> 00:22:12,905
With his life at stake,
Vegeta has begun his battle.

170
00:22:12,945 --> 00:22:21,245
Will Vegeta's super power be enough
to defeat the invincible Majin Boo?

171
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:38,795
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

172
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:45,385
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

173
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:55,945
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

174
00:22:55,985 --> 00:23:02,075
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

175
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:09,085
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

176
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:14,465
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

177
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,295
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

178
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:27,395
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

179
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,935
<i>Even now?</i>

180
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:36,565
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

181
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:41,945
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

182
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:48,455
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

183
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:58,465
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

184
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:15,695
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

185
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:19,065
<i>Are you all right, Vegeta?</i>
<i>Going off on your own like that?</i>

186
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:21,905
<i>What are you planning to do</i>
<i>against that freak opponent?</i>

187
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:24,865
<i>How can this be? That Majin bastard is strong,</i>

188
00:24:24,905 --> 00:24:27,575
<i>on top of which, he's immortal–it's ridiculous!</i>

189
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:29,705
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

190
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:33,085
<i>"A Warrior's Resolution!!</i>
<i>I Will Dispose Of the Majin."</i>

191
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:36,455
<i>What can he do? What can</i>
<i>he do to defeat Majin Boo?</i>

192
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:39,585
"Next time"
"A Warrior's Resolution!!
I Will Dispose Of the Majin"
