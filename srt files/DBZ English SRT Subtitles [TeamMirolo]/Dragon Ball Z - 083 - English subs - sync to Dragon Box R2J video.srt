<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,425 --> 00:01:54,725
<i>Having merged with Nail, and</i>
<i>benefiting from that great power-up,</i>

17
00:01:54,765 --> 00:02:00,595
<i>even Freeza finds himself in a</i>
<i>close battle against Piccolo. However...</i>

18
00:02:04,435 --> 00:02:10,735
Every time I, Freeza, transform
myself, my power substantially grows!

19
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:17,745
And I still have two more
transformations remaining!

20
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,445
What's that?!

21
00:02:25,455 --> 00:02:28,795
Shall we put an end to
this playing around, then?

22
00:02:30,765 --> 00:02:38,105
<i>The second transformation of Freeza brings</i>
<i>with it astounding battle power and speed.</i>

23
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:49,615
Stop it!!

24
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:58,115
<i>"Fear Me!! Freeza Does Battle</i>
<i>with a Third Transformation."</i>

25
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:26,885
<i>What?</i>

26
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:29,755
<i>Someone like you deserves to...</i>

27
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,425
...Die!!

28
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,725
G-Gohan!

29
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:23,095
Full power!

30
00:05:25,105 --> 00:05:26,765
<i>That brat...</i>

31
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:53,465
Hang in there, Gohan!

32
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:59,595
Thank you, Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

33
00:07:13,285 --> 00:07:14,745
Quite strange.

34
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:18,915
That little one should not
have such a battle power.

35
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:23,285
After recovering from near-death, it is
as if he is a different person altogether.

36
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,895
That's it! The little one is a Saiyan!

37
00:07:29,935 --> 00:07:32,395
But whose child is he?

38
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:33,565
Twenty years ago,

39
00:07:33,605 --> 00:07:35,565
with the exception of Vegeta, Nappa and Raditz,

40
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:38,895
the Saiyans were supposed
to have been exterminated.

41
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:40,775
So whose is he?

42
00:07:43,945 --> 00:07:47,905
He doesn't look like either Vegeta or Nappa...

43
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,915
So he's Raditz's child?

44
00:07:49,955 --> 00:07:52,615
There is something there
that reminds me of him.

45
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:06,225
T-That blast that just got bounced back...

46
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:08,565
You've gotten stronger, Gohan.

47
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:10,235
I'm so glad.

48
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:12,065
But it was no use.

49
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:18,275
I put everything I had into that,
and it still didn't connect against Freeza!

50
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:24,915
<i>That brat...</i>

51
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:30,255
<i>He is indisputably drawing</i>
<i>closer to becoming a Super Saiyan.</i>

52
00:08:30,295 --> 00:08:31,625
You!

53
00:08:32,795 --> 00:08:34,755
You must have figured it out!

54
00:08:34,795 --> 00:08:38,755
After coming one step away
from death, when we Saiyans recover,

55
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:40,635
our strength increases!

56
00:08:41,965 --> 00:08:43,265
Now listen!

57
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:48,865
Before Freeza makes his final transformation,
you must render me half-dead!

58
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:51,075
Well? Do it now!

59
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:57,545
The blood of the Saiyans
must be completely cut off.

60
00:08:57,585 --> 00:09:02,545
Not because I believe in ridiculous
legends, such as the Super Saiyan,

61
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:06,885
history's greatest warrior, but because
I do not feel well with them around.

62
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,555
It is the principle of it all,
with the little one and Vegeta

63
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:11,925
growing stronger so quickly.

64
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:16,065
If I injure myself, there will be no effect!

65
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:18,565
You must do it!

66
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:21,905
B-But my power isn't enough
to bring you to near-death!

67
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,235
Don't worry.

68
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:26,075
I'll lower my battle power as low as it will go.

69
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:28,245
Your power will be enough.

70
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:33,945
We're just lucky that Namekian kid
down there can heal people instantaneously.

71
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:38,585
No matter how much I may hate you, how can I?

72
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:45,225
Besides which, it's just
about time for Goku to recover.

73
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:47,225
Kakarrot is a lowest-class warrior!

74
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:49,425
He won't get any stronger than that!

75
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:53,905
Very well.

76
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:59,675
It would be a simple matter to blow
you all to pieces in this current form,

77
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:03,415
but before I kill you, I will have you
witness the terror of an ultimate power,

78
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:06,585
even more frightening than death!

79
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,955
Ultimate... what now?

80
00:10:09,725 --> 00:10:12,215
H-How can it be?

81
00:10:12,255 --> 00:10:14,725
I do you a great service!

82
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:19,555
You will experience a terror
even greater than that of Hell's.

83
00:10:19,595 --> 00:10:24,235
And so, gaze upon my final transformation!

84
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:28,335
My true form!

85
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:05,605
You rotten...

86
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:09,115
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

87
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:13,945
If you do it now, there's still time. Hurry!

88
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:38,765
What?! What's wrong with this planet?

89
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:06,125
It's all over! I'm going to die here!

90
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,395
If I'd known Son<i>-kun</i> were coming,

91
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:13,775
I could have left searching
for the Dragon Balls up to him!

92
00:13:14,945 --> 00:13:17,575
Gohan<i>-kun</i> is a fool! Kuririn is an idiot!

93
00:13:17,615 --> 00:13:20,775
I hate you, Son<i>-kun</i>!

94
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:27,745
<i>Freeza's ki is rising again.</i>

95
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:29,615
<i>Am I going to get out of here in time?</i>

96
00:13:34,795 --> 00:13:38,425
Hurry up! This is the only way!

97
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:39,795
<i>It can't be...</i>

98
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:50,775
There's no other choice!

99
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:56,145
Can't you even do that,
you good-for-nothing fool?!

100
00:13:56,185 --> 00:14:00,445
That's not good enough!
You have to shoot a stronger <i>ki</i>!

101
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:07,455
T-That's good...

102
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:12,625
I'm at last going to become... a Super Saiyan...

103
00:14:15,465 --> 00:14:20,305
W-Why did Kuririn<i>-san</i> shoot Vegeta?

104
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:27,705
G-Gohan! Get out of here!

105
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:29,235
Right!

106
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:38,715
Are you okay, Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

107
00:14:38,755 --> 00:14:41,095
I can't say that I am...

108
00:15:04,185 --> 00:15:08,045
I know! It's all right,
we can heal those injuries!

109
00:15:08,085 --> 00:15:11,415
There's a Namekian named
Dende that can heal injuries!

110
00:15:11,455 --> 00:15:14,255
I'll go get him.

111
00:15:17,095 --> 00:15:18,395
Gohan!

112
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:20,765
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, where's Dende?

113
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:31,335
What?! You say you can't heal me?

114
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,075
T-That's right!

115
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:39,075
You're saying you could
heal the others, but not me?

116
00:15:39,115 --> 00:15:45,355
You killed many of my friends as well!
I cannot heal someone like that!

117
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:51,395
Y-You brat! So long as you don't
heal me, Freeza will not be beaten!

118
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,095
I won't!

119
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:05,105
H-Hurry up... I'm starting
to lose consciousness...

120
00:16:05,145 --> 00:16:10,775
I... I... I...

121
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,625
I'm going to save the other one.

122
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,795
Damn...

123
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:30,465
You... brat...

124
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:36,735
Vegeta and the other Saiyans gain a whole
lot of strength once revived from near death.

125
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:38,005
You knew that, didn't you?

126
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:39,535
Y-Yeah.

127
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:44,245
And so, he had me blast him on purpose.

128
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:47,415
It sounded like he was
sure he could beat Freeza!

129
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:49,945
So that was why?

130
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:54,455
–Dende!
–Dende!

131
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:58,625
Vegeta!

132
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:12,605
They said... you can
heal injuries. Is that true?

133
00:17:12,645 --> 00:17:14,235
Y-Yes!

134
00:17:29,095 --> 00:17:30,755
Dende...

135
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:53,115
<i>I see, so that's it!</i>

136
00:17:54,455 --> 00:17:59,155
Unbelievable! Do I have the same ability?

137
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:04,855
No. You, like Nail<i>-san</i>, are a warrior-type.

138
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:06,895
More importantly, Dende,

139
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:09,765
I know how you feel,
not wanting to heal Vegeta.

140
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:13,765
For now, without him,
there isn't anything we can do!

141
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:17,105
He...

142
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:22,745
He's just like Freeza!

143
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:25,945
He's also killed so many Namekians!

144
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:33,285
Go heal him for me.

145
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:41,795
I can beat Vegeta now,
but I can't possibly beat Freeza.

146
00:18:56,785 --> 00:18:58,945
What now? Freeza is...

147
00:19:00,485 --> 00:19:02,955
He's finishing his transformation!

148
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:12,795
Ah, hell. All this time, we should have
masked our <i>ki</i> and hidden somewhere.

149
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,765
If we had done something like that,

150
00:19:14,805 --> 00:19:18,635
he would just blow us away,
planet Namek and all!

151
00:19:19,805 --> 00:19:24,475
He doesn't have any more use for this planet!

152
00:19:35,785 --> 00:19:39,315
T-That is one impossibly huge <i>ki.</i>

153
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:45,095
T-The incredible beast is about to appear!

154
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:48,795
Dende, please! Heal Vegeta!

155
00:20:07,755 --> 00:20:09,715
Dende...

156
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:11,585
We can see him now!

157
00:20:54,465 --> 00:20:56,595
You little turd!

158
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:04,775
You just be grateful that
I didn't kill you right here!

159
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,425
So that's Freeza's battle power?

160
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:24,795
Looks like he's revealed his true self.

161
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:33,065
Freeza, or anyone else, bring it on!

162
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:37,605
I have now become a Super Saiyan!

163
00:22:15,115 --> 00:22:19,745
<i>So this is Freeza? Such an incredible ki!</i>

164
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:24,085
<i>At last, Freeza completes</i>
<i>his third transformation.</i>

165
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:29,115
<i>Is there any hope left for Gohan and the others?</i>

166
00:22:44,745 --> 00:22:48,745
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

167
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:54,585
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

168
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:56,955
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

169
00:23:00,425 --> 00:23:05,455
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

170
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:11,965
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

171
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:16,065
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

172
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:19,575
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

173
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:22,245
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

174
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:29,715
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

175
00:23:31,955 --> 00:23:33,815
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

176
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,655
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

177
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:39,655
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

178
00:23:39,695 --> 00:23:45,335
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

179
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,505
<i>So sorry.</i>

180
00:23:47,545 --> 00:23:52,635
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:23:55,385 --> 00:24:00,645
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:14,025
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

183
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:18,195
<i>After Dende resuscitated Vegeta,</i>
<i>he powered up something incredible.</i>

184
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:21,465
<i>Has he really surpassed Freeza?</i>

185
00:24:21,505 --> 00:24:24,605
<i>I've decided to see for myself the</i>
<i>power of history's greatest warrior,</i>

186
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:27,275
<i>the legendary Super Saiyan.</i>

187
00:24:27,315 --> 00:24:29,145
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

188
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:32,245
<i>"The Death of Dende...</i>
<i>Come Forth! Intense, Wide-Open Power."</i>

189
00:24:32,285 --> 00:24:35,425
<i>Avenge Dende's death, Vegeta!</i>

190
00:24:35,465 --> 00:24:36,685
"Next time"
"The Death of Dende...
Come Forth! Intense, Wide-Open Power"
