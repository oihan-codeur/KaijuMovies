24
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,170

25
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,070
<i>Forgetting himself in his anger, Majin Boo</i>
<i>destroyed the wall between dimensions,</i>

26
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,160
<i>attempting to crush the universe.</i>

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,870
<i>However, at the last moment, Boo reclaimed</i>
<i>his sanity as a result of Vegetto's blow.</i>

28
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,770
That was close, that was close!
You sure do have awesome power, huh?

29
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,150
In which case, use that power to come hit me!

30
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,860
You were going to defeat
me as proof to all, right?

31
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,900
That you are the strongest in the universe?

32
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,910
<i>"The Ace Up Boo's Sleeve!!</i>
<i>'You Become a Hard Candy'!"</i>

33
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,060
Wow, this is unbelievable!

34
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,230
To think that Majin Boo's
attacks are of absolutely no use!

35
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,280
Well, it's only natural, in a sense.

36
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,740
It's all because Goku and Vegeta
there have merged together, after all.

37
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,410
It wouldn't be going like
this if Goku was by himself.

38
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:42,170
Still, you did really well to
have left Vegeta with a body, huh?

39
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,380
It's not surprising! I foresaw that this situation
could occur, so of course I left him his body!

40
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,180
Just who do you think I am, anyhow?

41
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,970
I am the guardian of the World
of the Afterlife, Great King Yama!

42
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,190
Indeed! And here I thought you
were always just acting important,

43
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,610
and absent-mindedly
stamping your seals on everything!

44
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,320
What's the matter? Come at me!

45
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,490
Try hitting me with that
power you just displayed!

46
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,430
Did you think I would
be beaten from just that?

47
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,760
You're a pesky bastard.

48
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,130
Shortly, I'm going to let
your central body have that.

49
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,670
If you were to just be wiped clean out,

50
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,050
then not even you could
return to normal again.

51
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,470
D-Damn it all...!

52
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,410
S-Shortly? Why doesn't he
just defeat him all at once?

53
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,530
If he lets him alone,
he could release that power

54
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,290
that can even break down
the walls between dimensions!

55
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,670
He must be playing around. Hmph!

56
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:54,540
This is not a game! Now!
Wipe out Majin Boo now!

57
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,430
Unless, maybe he has thought of something...

58
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,430
Damn it all...! Damn it all! Th-This...!

59
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,270
This wasn't supposed to be like this?

60
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,110
Look, don't get so depressed.
I'm surprised at this myself.

61
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:23,450
To think that I would be able
to make this big a fool out of you!

62
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,410
Y-You piece of crap! In that case...!

63
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,620
Ta-daa!

64
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,590
<i>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack</i>!!

65
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,170
So that's it. This is the technique
of Gotenks, who you've absorbed.

66
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,600
You knew that, huh? Then you must
also know how terrifying they are.

67
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,770
Touch them in the slightest,
and they'll explode!

68
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,480
They sure are some creepy guys!

69
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,400
Go!!

70
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,500
Let me give you something good!

71
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Did you think that
technique would work on me?

72
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,560
It's a technique thought up by a child!

73
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,560
You're awfully harried, aren't you?

74
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,690
I didn't think it would work either.

75
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,030
It's a technique I'm not accustomed to yet.

76
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,990
That was just some light warming up.

77
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,950
What you say is certainly true.

78
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:35,160
That was an infantile technique
thought up by a child. However...

79
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,060
...you can also use them this way.

80
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,480
We begin immediately!

81
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,650
Even increasing their number,
it will be the same thing.

82
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:11,820
Now, go, my ghosts!
<i>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack</i>!!

83
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,080
To the right!

84
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,410
What?

85
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,050
<i>Kame...</i>

86
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,710
It couldn't be...!

87
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,470
<i>...hame...</i>

88
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,430
<i>...Ha</i>!!

89
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,200
What?

90
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,290
<i>Kame...</i>

91
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,960
It couldn't be...!

92
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,840
<i>...hame...</i>

93
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,290
<i>...Ha</i>!!

94
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,830
They can control them too, huh?

95
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,210
He fell for it!

96
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,100
<i>Masenko</i>!!

97
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:25,790
That's what you get for looking down on
them as child's techniques, you wretched fool!

98
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,080
You're the one who's the fool.
You should have realized it sooner!

99
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,260
Instantaneous Movement, huh?

100
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,840
It was a well thought-out technique, for you.

101
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,560
Not even I could have escaped the damage
of a <i>Kamehame-Ha/Masenko</i> double-attack.

102
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,020
Still, a child's technique is,
after all, a child's technique.

103
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,230
It will not work against me.

104
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,450
I thought you were a bit stronger than this.

105
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:40,740
Could you make me get serious
about this before too much longer?

106
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,430
See here! Finish him off right now!

107
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,850
Are you planning on amusing yourself
some more by getting Boo angry?

108
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,850
Just what might his intentions be?

109
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,360
Damn, it looks like he's
gotten too strong! That idiot!

110
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,240
If you get too confident of your power,
things aren't going to go well!

111
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,430
I told you, the important thing
to grasp is the movement of <i>ki</i>!

112
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,430
Didn't you listen to what I said?

113
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,680
S-Shut up!

114
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,360
That was dirty of you–merging
yourselves together!

115
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,320
That's a fine thing for you to say,

116
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,190
when you're the one who kept
merging together with all those others!

117
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,700
Come on, come on, what's the matter?

118
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,870
Just my legs are enough
against the likes of you!

119
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,450
Why, you...!

120
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:19,800
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

121
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,050
Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

122
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,440
Hey, Gohan! Come on out!

123
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,480
Gohan-<i>kun</i>! Where are you?!

124
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,870
Where in the world could
that Gohan have gone to?

125
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,290
Please, do not lose heart, Chichi-<i>san.</i>

126
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,790
I, Dabura, will be certain to locate
Gohan-<i>san</i>, even if it costs me my life!

127
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,250
Now, look here. You're already dead.

128
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,430
There's no way you can die any further, so
there's no way it could cost you your life, right?

129
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,430
A-Ahem...

130
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,260
Gohan-<i>kun</i> could be
alive after all, couldn't he?

131
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,980
Of course, I don't want to
believe that Gohan-<i>kun</i> has died,

132
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:22,280
and I'm not saying it has
to follow, but far away, I...

133
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,450
Yes, far, far away, I can feel Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

134
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,870
It's not by the <i>ki</i> that Goku-<i>san</i>
talks about, but I feel Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

135
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,870
Videl-<i>san...</i>

136
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,880
I'm sorry, I can't express it well...

137
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,260
Sure, right? I believe you too!
Gohan-<i>kun</i> is still alive!

138
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,550
If you believe in your wishes...
if you keep believing in them,

139
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:48,760
they will surely come true some time!

140
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,770
And as for me, I want Gohan-<i>kun</i> to be alive!

141
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,190
Bulma-<i>san...</i>

142
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,860
A young maiden in love is strong, you know!

143
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,440
Why, I...!

144
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,450
Is this true?

145
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,950
I believe as well, Videl-<i>san</i>!

146
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,450
Surely, surely Gohan-<i>san</i> is alive! Indeed he is!

147
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,580
Ah, this must be what is called affection!

148
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,670
How beautiful it is! How marvelous it is!

149
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,050
You still don't seem to fully understand,

150
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:32,430
so under the circumstances,
I'll explain it to you bluntly.

151
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,190
It is useless for you!
Useless to try to win against me!

152
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,230
How about finally giving up?

153
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,440
It would be useless for
you to work at it any longer.

154
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,030
<i>Damn... To think that I would have</i>
<i>a hard time fighting against this guy!</i>

155
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,370
<i>However, at this rate...</i>

156
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,500
What are you going to do?
Do you plan on continuing still?

157
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,220
Of course I do! There's no way I can lose!
I am the strongest in the universe!

158
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,100
Come and get it! I'll utterly pound you!

159
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,690
What's the matter? Are you afraid of me?

160
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,780
Come on, now! Come here!

161
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,790
<i>A little farther... A little bit farther...</i>

162
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,620
You talk like you're so big!
You're just a wimp who's all talk!

163
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,380
Now, come on, come on!

164
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,380
Hmph! You're one punk that never learns!

165
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,170
<i>All right!</i>

166
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:52,220
Hey, do you like coffee candy?

167
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,360
What?!

168
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,320
G-Goku-<i>san</i>! Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

169
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:29,760
Yahoo!! Hey, hey, hey! Worthless fool! Take that!

170
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,760
That's what you get for
coming near me carelessly!

171
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,350
You piece of crap!

172
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,180
I-It can't be...!

173
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:44,690
Y-You imbecile! This is why I told you
to wipe him out quickly, you little turd!

174
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,530
I just knew he was too confident in his power!

175
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,370
Now everything has come to naught!

176
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,950
Shall I chew you up all at once?

177
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,160
Or should I suck on you, little by
little dissolving you away instead?

178
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,880
<i>W-What is this?! Vegetto has</i>
<i>been turned into a coffee candy!</i>

179
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,470
<i>There are no longer any warriors</i>
<i>left on Earth that can defeat Boo!</i>

180
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:19,220
<i>And so, the greatest crisis</i>
<i>to face the Earth has arrived!</i>

181
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:38,780
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

182
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,330
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

183
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:55,930
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

184
00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:02,020
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

185
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:09,020
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

186
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:14,400
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

187
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,280
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

188
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:27,330
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

189
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,880
<i>Even now?</i>

190
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:36,510
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

191
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:41,930
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

192
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:48,400
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

193
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:58,450
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

194
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,050
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

195
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,340
<i>What's the matter, Majin Boo? At this point,</i>

196
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,350
<i>there ain't but a single thing</i>
<i>left that you can do, is there?</i>

197
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:26,730
<i>Then, Vegetto-san did have an idea</i>
<i>in mind when he was pressing Boo.</i>

198
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,940
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

199
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,520
<i>"A Hero Lost!? Vegetto is Absorbed."</i>

200
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,440
<i>Now that even Father and</i>
<i>Vegeta have been absorbed,</i>

201
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,610
<i>what will become of the earth?</i>

202
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,530
"Next time"
"A Hero Lost!? Vegetto is Absorbed"
