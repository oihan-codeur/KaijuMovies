<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,050
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,680
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,690
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,620

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

24
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,090
<i>the mighty, wicked</i>
<i>Majin Boo was restored to life.</i>

25
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,920

<i>Boo even destroyed the Earth,</i>

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,470

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,540
<i>However, by using the power of the</i>

<i>Once again, peace had returned to Earth.</i>
<i>And then, ten years passed by...</i>

32
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,190
<i>"Grandpa Goku! I Am Pan!!"</i>

33
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,140
Sheesh, this is no use.
Going like this just feels too sluggish.

34
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,600
All right...

35
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,660
Let's go!

36
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,650
Excuse me!

37
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,240
Trunks!

38
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,790
How nice of you to come!
It's been a while, hasn't it?

39
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,420
Good day, Chichi-<i>san</i>! Um, is Goten here?

40
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:46,420
Goten? He left with Goku-<i>sa</i>
early this morning. I know!

41
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,760
Gohan probably knows where they went.

42
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,260
Is that right? Well, I'll go try asking Gohan-<i>san.</i>

43
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,180
Thank you very much!

44
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,650
Good day!

45
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,990
Um, excuse me...?

46
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,630
Next, let's take a look at the
weather situation for the Paozu area.

47
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,800
The atmospheric depression that
brought some rain with it last night

48
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,470
–Yo! Welcome!
–was carried away by winds out of the west,

49
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,180
leaving the sky completely clear
this morning, without a cloud in sight!

50
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,230
It's a pleasure, Gohan-<i>san.</i>

51
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,810
I can't break away right now.
Could you take these for me for a second?

52
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,820
Ah, yes!

53
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,740
You know, there's nothing
but difficult-looking books here.

54
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,700
I have to put together the materials I'm
going to use at the next academic meeting.

55
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,200
Oh, set them down on that table there.

56
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,750
Gohan-<i>san</i>, you've completely
become a scholar, huh?

57
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,170
I suppose.

58
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,050
Pan! Go clean up your room! Pan!

59
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,760
Oh, welcome, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

60
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,770
Videl-<i>san</i>, sorry to intrude.

61
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,230
Really, that Pan just
leaves her room so messy...!

62
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,770
Come, brave warriors!

63
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,190
This is the world combat sports
super champion, Mister Satan!

64
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,780
I will accept challenges from anyone!

65
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,950
I'll be waiting for you on the grounds
of this year's Tenkaichi Tournament!

66
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,450
The Tenkaichi Tournament starts tomorrow!

67
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,880
Really, I declare... I don't
know what to do with Papa.

68
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,630
He's all right, isn't he?

69
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:55,720
After all, Satan-<i>san</i> magnificently
saved the earth, and is everyone's hero.

70
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,390
You could say he saved us,

71
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,220
but using the Dragon Balls,
everyone's memories have been erased.

72
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:06,230
Nobody remembers what it was
that Papa saved the earth from.

73
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,610
More importantly, Trunks,
didn't you need something?

74
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,780
Oh, right, right. Do you know where Goten is?

75
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,160
Goten is on the mountain out
back training with Dad and the others.

76
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,240
Vegeta-<i>san</i> and Bulma-<i>san</i> are there too.

77
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,450
Papa and them are here too?

78
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,180
Good grief, would you
look at this father and son?

79
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,570
Geez, you're not showing any mercy, Father!

80
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,450
It's been a while, huh Bulma, Vegeta?

81
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,210
It hasn't been just a while!

82
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,630
I mean, really! If we were to leave you alone,
you'd never come to see us, would you?

83
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,800
You've been that way since long ago.

84
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,800
That ain't so!

85
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,810
We just saw you a mere
five years ago, didn't we?

86
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,810
That's five years! Five years!

87
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,400
Everyone else got together, but you said
you had to train, and couldn't come, right?

88
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,520
Th-That's true, but...

89
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,660
W-What?!

90
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,330
You've become a total auntie, huh?

91
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,710
Hush, you!

92
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:55,170
Even looking like this, people
often say "Ma'am, you're so young!"

93
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,170
You Saiyans are monsters
for never changing at all!

94
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,180
We Saiyans are a warrior race.

95
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,180
As such, our youthful period
lasts longer, so that we can fight.

96
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,770
Maybe next chance, I'll ask
Shen Long to make me young again.

97
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,900
By the way, Kakarrot,

98
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,190
when you say you're entering the Tenkaichi
Tournament tomorrow, are you serious?

99
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:20,780
Yeah, I'm going, I'm going. I decided today.

100
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,200
Vegeta, you enter too!

101
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,200
Why?

102
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,790
Why, all of a sudden, have you decided
to enter this tournament in particular?

103
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,580
Because there's going to be someone
else that appears to be strong entering too.

104
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,420
I've been interested in him for
a long time, and this morning,

105
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,210
he arrived at the tournament grounds.

106
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,000
What's this?

107
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,760
I don't feel any <i>ki</i> that's all that strong.

108
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,600
That's because he's got
his <i>ki</i> completely reigned in.

109
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,270
But I can more or less tell.
This guy is definitely strong!

110
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:57,730
You're kidding, right? There's no
way this guy could be. Is he an alien?

111
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,110
No, he's an Earthling.

112
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,150
An Earthling?

113
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,320
You're not going to tell me he's an
Artificial Human or something, right?

114
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,370
He's an ordinary human.

115
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,750
What was that?

116
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,750
Such a thing isn't possible!

117
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,130
How can there be a human who can
put up a decent fight against you guys?

118
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,680
Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

119
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,140
Yo!

120
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,970
Oh, you've come too?

121
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,270
Mm-hmm. What's this, Goten?

122
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,270
Looks like you're training, huh?

123
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,320
Are you planning on
entering the tournament too?

124
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,610
Father told me to enter. I told him
I don't want to, but he's forcing me.

125
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,160
I'd made a date for tomorrow, too.

126
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,620
Hey, stop complaining. You can
have a date anytime, can't you?

127
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,630
We're both put upon by how
weak our children are becoming, huh?

128
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,920
It's true! Well, that just goes
to show how peaceful things are.

129
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,430
Back already, huh?

130
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,690
My, it's Pan-<i>chan</i>!

131
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,320
Grandpa, I flew around the Earth!

132
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,320
All right! Terrific! That was pretty quick, huh?

133
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,700
I'm all ready for tomorrow now, right?

134
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,370
T-Tomorrow?

135
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:32,740
Pan-<i>chan</i>, you're not by any chance
thinking of entering the tournament, are you?

136
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,870
Mm-hmm, that's right.

137
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
But as I remember,

138
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,670
the children's division is gone
from the tournament these days, right?

139
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,260
Are you thinking of matching
up together with the adults?

140
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,260
Well, she probably can't win, but
she's sure to get up to someplace good!

141
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,260
Right now, the one with the
most guts in our house is Pan here.

142
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,110
This sounds like it will
be fun. Maybe I will enter.

143
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:03,190
Hey, Trunks, you enter too.

144
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,440
That's an order. Unless you want
your allowance cut in half, that is.

145
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,410
Nice going, nice going!

146
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,950
It sure is terribly bustlin' here.

147
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,660
It's not so much a
tournament as it is a festival, huh?

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Say, say...

149
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,380
What is it, Pan?

150
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,550
Grandpa, let's go look around!

151
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,380
Sure we will... Say, there's still some time, right?

152
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,550
Yeah. We got here pretty early, after all.

153
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,010
All right, shall we go?

154
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,020
Father!

155
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,390
Grandpa, hurry, hurry!

156
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,850
Hey, Pan! Hold on! Hold on! Pan, I say!

157
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,560
Here.

158
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,030
Hey, you! Hold it right there!

159
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,030
Hey, hey! Move it, move it!

160
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,070
That was easy!

161
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,550
Okay, thank you!

162
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,180
Huh? Pan...?

163
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,600
You pipsqueak! Get in my way,
will you? You're a nuisance!

164
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,400
My ice cream...!

165
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,610
What?! You got something to say?! Huh?!

166
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,990
W-What is it?

167
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,160
Y-Yikes...!

168
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,960
Don't do it, Pan...!

169
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,430
My ice cream...

170
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,630
Pan!

171
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,680
The doggies are licking it!

172
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:38,450
My, my...

173
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,200
There, there! Here, Grandpa will
give you his, so don't cry anymore.

174
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,340
Hold it!

175
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Oh, they're here, they're here!

176
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,580
Yo, everyone! You're all looking good!

177
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,000
Don't "you're looking good" us, Goku!

178
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,880
Training is fine and all, but at
least contact us every once in a while!

179
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,000
I haven't heard so much as a peep from you.

180
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,010
Sorry, sorry! Actually, Bulma yelled
at me about that same thing yesterday.

181
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:43,560
You're the same as ever, huh Son?

182
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,560
Piccolo, aren't you entering?

183
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,350
There's no way I could
fight against you any more.

184
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:55,360
Today, I wanted to have a look at
just how strong you guys have gotten.

185
00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:00,820
Father, you'd better hurry. They're
going to close entry applications soon.

186
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,620
Let's go, Grandpa!

187
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,040
Well, see you later, then.

188
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,420
Yeah, we'll be in the stands!

189
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,790
Okay!

190
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:19,970
You know, it's rare for
there to be a grandfather

191
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,390
for whom the word
"grandfather" seems so out of place.

192
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,390
Let's go with the same
strategy this time, as always.

193
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,390
Boo-<i>san</i>, you'll become the
Challenger Champion, and fight against me,

194
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:37,570
the Super Champion, but end up losing.

195
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,110
And as is the custom,

196
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,990
please be sure to hold back all of your
power when fighting the other challengers.

197
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,500
If you're too strong, there won't be
any more challengers next time, after all!

198
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,700
I know, I know.

199
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,430
What now, more of my fans?

200
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,140
And I told them not to let anyone in.

201
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,980
Yo.

202
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,440
Oh! Well if it isn't Goku-<i>san</i>!

203
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,650
Good day, Grandpa.

204
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,990
And my cute little Pan-<i>chan</i>, too!
Have you been well?

205
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,900
Your whiskers hurt!

206
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:35,000
Did you come just to cheer your grandpa on?

207
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,460
I'm going to enter the matches too.

208
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,250
It shouldn't be surprising, but
everyone passed the preliminaries.

209
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,390
It's been a while!

210
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:48,550
What's this?!

211
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:54,480
Don't worry! If one of us wins
through, we'll let you have the victory.

212
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,360
Really?! You really will, right?

213
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,690
Y-Yeah...

214
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:06,410
However, somebody
besides us or Boo may win, too.

215
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:08,410
Not again, not again!

216
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,580
There's no way that something
like that could happen, is there?

217
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,330
Say, Satan-<i>san</i>, everyone
else has come to the stadium,

218
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,590
but there aren't any seats left, so they
said they wanted you to do something.

219
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,420
Is that right, is that right?

220
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,470
Something like that is an easy
matter to handle! Just leave that to me!

221
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,060
Huh? What's with those guys?

222
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,610
<i>W-What is this...?</i>

223
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,700
<i>Hold on, is he serious?</i>

224
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,960
<i>S-Sure enough, we'll be able to</i>
<i>see well enough from here, but...</i>

225
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,670
<i>we're not on display!</i>

226
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:05,470
I-If I'd known it was going to
be like this, I would have entered.

227
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,300
Geez, Papa...

228
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,470
This is embarrassing.

229
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,310
They've got to be kidding, putting
us here. Let's have them move us!

230
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,020
Um, I'll go ask my Papa.

231
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,320
Mama, this is a good view!

232
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
Indeed!

233
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,960
Well, they had a nice place
like this all along, didn't they?

234
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,500
Thank goodness!

235
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,790
Yeah, yeah, I was worried
what was going to happen.

236
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,550
Somebody is coming out!

237
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,430
Okay then, we will now hold the drawing
to determine the pairings for the matches!

238
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
please greet them with applause!

239
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,270
This is everyone who admirably managed

240
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,230
to pass the preliminaries
and advance into the finals!

241
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,510
Long ago, when we fought here,
I was the one that won, huh?

242
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,510
I won't lose this time!

243
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,320
–It's Boo-<i>sama</i>!
–Boo-<i>sama</i>! Boo-<i>sama</i>!

244
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,610
Boo's gotten popular, having
participated every single time.

245
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,020
<i>At last, the Tenkaichi Tournament begins.</i>

246
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:24,020
<i>Who is this incredible</i>
<i>guy that Goku spoke of?</i>

247
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:28,400
<i>The heated battles are about to get underway.</i>

248
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,570
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

249
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,160
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

250
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:55,720
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

251
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,850
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

252
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,810
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

253
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:14,190
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

254
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,070
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

255
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:27,170
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

256
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,710
<i>Even now?</i>

257
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:36,340
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

258
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,720
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

259
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,230
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

260
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:58,240
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

261
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,210
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

262
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,340
<i>I hate to ask, Boo,</i>

263
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,010
<i>but could you change the lottery</i>
<i>numbers with your magic for me?</i>

264
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,550
<i>I simply have to fight that boy first.</i>

265
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,510
<i>What do you mean, Kakarrot?</i>

266
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:27,190
<i>Don't tell me that boy</i>
<i>really has that much power.</i>

267
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,310
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

268
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,070
<i>"I Am Oob!</i>
<i>Now 10 Years Old, the Former Majin!?"</i>

269
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,530
<i>Huh? You say that boy is</i>
<i>the reincarnation of Majin Boo?</i>

270
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,360
"Next time"
"I Am Oob!
Now 10 Years Old, the Former Majin!?"
