<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,000
<i>Goku had not returned,</i>

17

18
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,350
<i>Having sought Kami's throne previously,</i>

19
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,690
<i>but instead finding himself sealed within</i>

20
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,390
<i>Garlic Jr. returns!</i>

21
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,900
With the help of this mist,

22
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,530
all living things will
undergo a demonic rebirth,

23
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:06,510
resulting in the world's
descent to an utterly hellish state!

24
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,760
<i>"Black Mist of Terror...!!</i>
<i>Everyone Turns Demonic."</i>

25
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,690
Garlic, my father,

26
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:07,360
I was able to carry out your will, and
have taken the Throne of Kami as my own.

27
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,500
All that remains is for me to use the
Dragon Balls to resurrect you to this world.

28
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:18,810
By that time, the Earth will be overrun
and controlled by the Demon Clan!

29
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,580
Father, please wait just a little while longer.

30
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,360
Haven't you found them yet?

31
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,060
Please, forgive me.

32
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,830
Even now that I possess Kami's water mirrors,

33
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,330
which can project any
point in the Lower World,

34
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,000
to think that I still cannot locate them...

35
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,670
You two have something to do with this.

36
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,210
I'll pay you back a hundred-fold
for everything you've done to me.

37
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,680
You'll slowly and steadily experience
a suffering worse than that of hell.

38
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,550
<i>Particularly when it</i>
<i>comes to Son Goku and his son.</i>

39
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,920
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

40
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,590
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!!

41
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,190
Gohan<i>-chan</i>'s gone off an' turned delinquent!

42
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,730
He's been enticed by Kuririn,
that friend of Goku<i>-sa</i>'s.

43
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,400
If he spends too much time
playin' at Muten Roshi's place,

44
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,370
his lechery will rub off on him!

45
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,880
Oh, my Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

46
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,650
Pretty soon we'll see
everyone, right Haiya Dragon?

47
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,020
What's the matter, Haiya Dragon?

48
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,990
What are you doing, Haiya Dragon?

49
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,670
Really, what are you up to?

50
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,650
You're a strange one.

51
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,710
Squirrel<i>-kun</i>!

52
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,710
Haiya Dragon!

53
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,510
What's the matter, everyone? Stop!

54
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,490
They're usually such gentle
animals! What's going on?

55
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,840
Mister Popo, it won't do
any good for us to struggle.

56
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,740
All we can do is wait for help to come.

57
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,650
But Kami<i>-sama</i>, Garlic Jr. used Aquamist.

58
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,880
Doing that, everyone
will turn into Demon Clan.

59
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,820
Both he and his father
are beneath contempt.

60
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,420
He's repeating what happened before...

61
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,910
If only Son Goku were here.

62
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,720
Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i>! We've found him!

63
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,850
What?!

64
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,790
It's the son of Son Goku!

65
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,030
We've found you, kid!

66
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,930
Bring that kid here!

67
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,210
If we just capture him,
Son Goku is sure to show himself!

68
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:41,360
Kuririn! Be sure to catch us
something good for supper!

69
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,070
We're counting on you!

70
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,040
Yamucha<i>-san</i>, how about
lending a hand out here?

71
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,370
You said not to worry about it,

72
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,850
that you were going to do this yourself
to show that cute girlfriend of yours!

73
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,890
Hi, Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

74
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,660
I'll help you out there.

75
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,330
Maron<i>-chan</i>!

76
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,330
Oh, yeah!

77
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,540
A young woman's skin is so fine...

78
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,440
It's so bouncy!

79
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,020
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

80
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,350
Maron<i>-chan</i>!

81
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,950
Kuririn, look out!

82
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,050
Where is Gohan?!
I know he's here somewhere!

83
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,380
Chichi<i>-san</i>!

84
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,050
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>, now's the most
important time for my Gohan<i>-chan.</i>

85
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,690
I don't want him associatin' with
any of his strange delinquent friends,

86
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,520
if you please.

87
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,190
D-Delinquent friends?

88
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,960
By that, do you mean us?

89
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,940
A-yep.

90
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,930
Just a minute there, Auntie.

91
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,600
Auntie?!

92
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,670
Everyone here is having such a nice time,

93
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:32,370
we wish you wouldn't
be such a wet blanket.

94
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,310
Did you just call me
by the name "Auntie?"

95
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,580
Oh, if that's the way it came across,
then I apologize.

96
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,490
But in any case, Auntie,

97
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:53,330
be it Gohan<i>-chan</i> or Rice<i>-chan</i>
or whoever, the boy isn't here.

98
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,360
You're gonna pay!!

99
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,430
How dare you, another woman,
look someone as young and beautiful

100
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,470
as myself in the face and call her Auntie!

101
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,640
W-W-W-Wait just a second, Chichi<i>-san</i>!

102
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,810
You can't seriously fight against this amateur!

103
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,520
Old man Turtle, you really are a perv!

104
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,190
Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

105
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,690
Maron<i>-chan</i>, come on, come on! Look!

106
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,030
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, the Auntie was
just about to show me something.

107
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:32,370
Let go of me! Lemme go!
Let me fight with that young missy!

108
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,340
Let go!

109
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,010
Oh, Pafu-pafu, pafu-pafu!

110
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:43,040
I'll fight her! I'll make that young
missy pay! Let us fight! She has to pay!

111
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,400
Maron<i>-chan</i>, it's a
dangerous thing to get her mad!

112
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,030
How come?

113
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,700
She is the one person even
Super Saiyan Goku is afraid of,

114
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,040
making her the most
powerful woman in the universe!

115
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,380
And who is this Goku person?

116
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,180
Look, how many times
have I explained it to you?

117
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,050
Son Goku, who's my friend.

118
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:24,720
Oh, whatever.

119
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,230
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, wait!

120
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,270
I won't let her get away with it!

121
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,350
Not in that terrifying
swimsuit she's wearing!

122
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,380
She's a devil woman!

123
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,640
Everyone's going to be
so surprised to see me.

124
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,390
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

125
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,390
Huh? Gohan!

126
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,870
Maron<i>-san</i>, good day!

127
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,670
That's right, your name
was Gohan<i>-kun</i>, wasn't it?

128
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,700
He's who all that was about.

129
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,340
Hey, Gohan, you didn't tell
Chichi<i>-san</i> you were coming, did you?

130
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,080
You don't mean, don't tell me...

131
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,750
That's right, your mother is already here.

132
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,420
And she is reeeally mad!

133
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,450
What should I do?

134
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,600
It's okay, though.

135
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,340
Kurin<i>-chan</i> said he'd
apologize to your mother for you.

136
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,110
Pretty good, huh?

137
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,710
M-Me apologize to Chichi?!
There's no way I'd do that!

138
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,680
Is that so, Kurin<i>-chan</i>?

139
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,380
I guess I've overstepped my bounds, huh?

140
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,720
J-J-Just a second...

141
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,090
I'm going home.

142
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,020
All right, all right.

143
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,030
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

144
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,900
That's my Kurin<i>-chan</i>!

145
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,420
We're almost there, Gohan.

146
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,390
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, hang tough!

147
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,440
Mother!

148
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,650
Chichi<i>-san</i>, please forgive him!
Gohan wasn't trying to be bad!

149
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,560
I'm sorry. I left without
saying so, and I apologize.

150
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,190
Chichi<i>-san</i>! You didn't have to go that far!

151
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,560
What do you think you're doing, Auntie?

152
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,930
Not again!

153
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,140
Mother...

154
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:18,720
Maron<i>-chan</i>, you just
had to go and say that again!

155
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,750
This is my fault?

156
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,740
I'm sorry! I'll do my studies,

157
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,050
and listen to what you say,
and even help around the house!

158
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,700
What's the matter with you, Mother?

159
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,510
What do you want, old man?!

160
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,210
Go away!

161
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,690
Kurin<i>-chan</i>, help me!

162
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:28,090
W-W-Wait just a second,
we can talk this out!

163
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,930
I know that Maron<i>-chan</i> must have
said something to upset you, but...

164
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,340
She has so many other
cute qualities about her.

165
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,370
What's wrong with all of you?!

166
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,070
Mother!

167
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,610
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

168
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,510
Be careful, Gohan!

169
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,380
There's something wrong with everyone!

170
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,590
Mother...

171
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,230
No! Stay back! Go away! Don't come closer!

172
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,070
Maron<i>-chan</i>!

173
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,050
So, you didn't breathe the Aquamist, hmm?

174
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,550
How lucky for you.

175
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,750
It took quite a bit of effort
to find you, son of Son Goku!

176
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,690
Who are these monsters?

177
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,280
G-Gohan!

178
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,350
You're the ones who did
this to my mother, aren't you?!

179
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,820
That's right, kid.

180
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,880
Change my mother back!

181
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:45,790
Impossible. To reverse the effects of
the Aquamist requires Ultra Holy Water.

182
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,160
Ultra Holy Water?

183
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,000
However, the Holy Water can only be
found in the Temple of the Heavenly Realm.

184
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,130
How about it, kid?

185
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,500
Why don't you come to
the Heavenly Realm with us?

186
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,010
You're quite welcome!

187
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,710
What?!

188
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,610
Looks like he's going to make a go of it.

189
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,320
However, he's no match for us.

190
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,360
<i>I can't move!</i>

191
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,920
Didn't we just say you were no match for us?

192
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,710
Who's there?!

193
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:47,060
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

194
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,360
If it isn't Piccolo<i>-san.</i>
We've been waiting for you.

195
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,200
I had heard that some crude Demon
Clansmen were out messing around.

196
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,370
It's you guys, is it?

197
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,940
Garlic<i>-sama</i> is waiting for you.

198
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,740
He said he has much he wishes to say to you.

199
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,080
What? Did you say Garlic Jr.?

200
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,690
<i>Piccolo appears as Gohan faces danger.</i>

201
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,420
<i>Is there any way to rescue the Earth...</i>

202
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:27,390
<i>...from the plans of that</i>
<i>embodiment of the devil, Garlic Jr.?</i>

203
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,580
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

204
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,420
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

205
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,800
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

206
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

207
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,810
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

208
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,910
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

209
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

210
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,050
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

211
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,530
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

212
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,660
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

213
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,460
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

214
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,500
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

215
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:45,170
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

216
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,340
<i>So sorry.</i>

217
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,480
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

218
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,490
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

219
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,730
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

220
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,840
<i>Gohan, hurry to the Heavenly Realm!</i>

221
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,970
<i>You have to get the Ultra</i>
<i>Holy Water before sunrise,</i>

222
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:19,570
<i>or you'll never be able to</i>
<i>change everyone back to normal!</i>

223
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,740
<i>That sounds like fun, doesn't it? I'm coming, too.</i>

224
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,210
<i>Maron-chan, the place we're</i>
<i>going isn't going to be so carefree!</i>

225
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,180
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

226
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,190
<i>"The Heavenly Realm is the Battlefield!!</i>
<i>Piccolo Becomes Devilish Again..."</i>

227
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,900
<i>I'll get rid of Garlic!</i>

228
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,390
"Next time"
"The Heavenly Realm is the Battlefield!!
Piccolo Becomes Devilish Again..."
