3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:08,225
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:06,295 --> 00:02:12,635
<i>Freeza's overwhelming power was</i>
<i>far greater than anyone had expected.</i>

17
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:38,955

<i>"The Tide Suddenly Turned!!</i>
<i>Piccolo, the Warrior Who Came Late."</i>

19

What's wrong?

20
00:03:25,605 --> 00:03:29,095
Vegeta, aren't you coming to help him?

21
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:34,275
Looks as though your legs are
trembling, and you can't move.

22
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:38,245
Well, you just wait there
patiently a little while longer.

23
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,915
I'm about to smother the
breath of life from this one.

24
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,615
After which it will be your turn.

25
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:55,225
<i>I-I don't care if the kid dies,</i>

26
00:03:55,265 --> 00:04:00,765
<i>I'm just wondering what I'm supposed to do.</i>
<i>Freeza's power is beyond imagination!</i>

27
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:08,215
<i>Father... Pic... colo... -san...</i>

28
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:27,265
<i>Gohan's ki is disappearing quickly.</i>

29
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:30,635
<i>H-He's dying! Dammit!</i>

30
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:41,945
<i>I can't wait until I've completely</i>
<i>recovered from my injuries!</i>

31
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:05,635
Gohan's <i>ki</i> has all but disappeared!

32
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:23,285
<i>You're the only one that</i>
<i>ever freely associated with me.</i>

33
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:28,955
<i>Before I realized what had happened,</i>
<i>you found your way into my heart,</i>

34
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:35,455
<i>and made yourself a place there large</i>
<i>enough that I was unable to drive you out.</i>

35
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:13,605
Stay alive, Gohan!

36
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:30,385
Is there nothing I can do?
If I don't act, I'll be next!

37
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:38,455
<i>Gohan, just hang on. I'll be right there.</i>

38
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:49,945
Now the big finish!

39
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:01,485
H-How can he be?!

40
00:07:07,765 --> 00:07:13,465
He was supposed to have
been at least critically wounded!

41
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:18,465
W-Why?!

42
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:20,975
<i>Kienzan</i>!

43
00:07:29,985 --> 00:07:31,615
<i>Kuririn...</i>

44
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:37,285
<i>Kuririn's ki has been restored! What's going on?</i>

45
00:08:01,685 --> 00:08:05,845
If you don't like it, come on over here!

46
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,015
Come and paddle my bum!

47
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:14,795
Why you... How dare you make a fool of me!

48
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:22,425
<i>Th-There's no way I can stand against him.</i>

49
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:25,305
<i>I'll just have to keep running away.</i>

50
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:37,145
<i>Somehow, I've got to keep him</i>
<i>a little bit further away from Gohan.</i>

51
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,485
Oh no!

52
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:54,595
All right...

53
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:29,095
You will not die easily.

54
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,125
I'll take you apart with my own hands.

55
00:10:06,475 --> 00:10:08,135
Damn.

56
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:12,145
Fool.

57
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:19,455
Now, come on out!

58
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:26,625
That was close!

59
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,275
I don't know how it is you recovered,

60
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:54,155
but you dared to clip the
tail of Freeza<i>-sama</i>, didn't you?

61
00:10:55,625 --> 00:11:00,625
I'm going to knock you into so
many pieces, you'll never recover again!

62
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:02,955
Now I've done it!

63
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,965
Damn!

64
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:26,155
No matter how you struggle,
you will not escape my grasp.

65
00:11:44,605 --> 00:11:47,405
Looks like you're about out of breath.

66
00:11:47,445 --> 00:11:49,935
I'll tear you to bits with my bare hands!

67
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:57,285
Come on out!

68
00:12:15,305 --> 00:12:16,595
Die!

69
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:19,625
<i>Taiyo-ken</i>!

70
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:44,095
<i>Taiyo-ken</i>!

71
00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:06,085
M-My eyes!

72
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,425
Thank goodness! You're not dead!

73
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:26,105
I'll heal you right now!

74
00:13:57,335 --> 00:13:59,395
R-Rotten Earthling!

75
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:02,105
Calling me out here for such a vain struggle...

76
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:06,775
Vegeta, now! Attack him!

77
00:14:26,905 --> 00:14:30,535
S-So that's what's going on!

78
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:34,905
What are you doing, Vegeta?!

79
00:14:38,415 --> 00:14:42,045
Great! Gohan's been healed!

80
00:14:42,085 --> 00:14:48,045
Why did you guys keep silent about
the Namekian kid having that ability?!

81
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:51,715
We didn't keep silent!
We didn't know about it either!

82
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:55,255
If we had known, we would
have him heal Goku already!

83
00:15:02,165 --> 00:15:05,135
It doesn't hurt at all any more!

84
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:07,735
You surprised me, Dende! Thanks.

85
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,765
Not at all. Good luck!

86
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:17,085
Shoot! Why you!

87
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:21,415
W-What's this?!

88
00:15:38,775 --> 00:15:41,735
True to the Saiyan blood that
he carries, now that he's recovered,

89
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:45,105
his battle power has increased greatly!

90
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:50,075
Gohan...

91
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,215
All right!

92
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:55,885
Slight though it may be, fate
has somewhat turned to our favor.

93
00:15:55,925 --> 00:16:00,755
With the three of us fighting
now, something may turn out.

94
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:03,895
Impossible! That runt has been revived!

95
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:07,765
And he should have been on the brink of death!

96
00:16:07,805 --> 00:16:09,595
Now! Shoot him!

97
00:16:39,095 --> 00:16:41,725
You guys just don't know when you're beaten.

98
00:16:41,765 --> 00:16:48,735
How many times have I told you that neither
Earthlings or Saiyans are a match for me?

99
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:50,265
Dammit.

100
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,745
Have we had it?

101
00:16:53,785 --> 00:16:57,745
I'm not giving up! How can I possibly give up?!

102
00:16:57,785 --> 00:17:01,915
Whether we've had it or not,
there's nothing we can do but try!

103
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,245
Gohan!

104
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:05,455
You fool! Stop!

105
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,245
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

106
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:38,885
Sorry to keep you waiting.

107
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:48,095
Thank goodness! We've been
waiting for you, Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

108
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,405
So that's Freeza, is it?

109
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:56,935
Yes!

110
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:12,555
Indeed. He really is an incredible beast.

111
00:18:12,595 --> 00:18:17,755
Well, if it isn't the guy we
slaughtered back on Earth.

112
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:24,095
So, I need not wonder what you
wished for with the Dragon Balls.

113
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:28,105
I see you brought this good-for-nothing
scum back to life with them.

114
00:18:28,145 --> 00:18:32,105
That "scum" line was uncalled-for.
And I want you to remember something.

115
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:36,745
I want you to remember that after
I put Freeza away, your turn comes next.

116
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:39,445
After you put Freeza away,
you're coming for me?

117
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:45,415
I didn't think you Namekians
were capable of telling jokes.

118
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,395
<i>It's no use!</i>

119
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:54,365
<i>No matter how much Piccolo may have</i>
<i>gained from training at Kaio-sama's place,</i>

120
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:58,065
<i>Freeza's on a completely different</i>
<i>dimension from the rest of us!</i>

121
00:19:00,805 --> 00:19:04,765
There's still a surviving Namekian, is there?

122
00:19:05,815 --> 00:19:10,915
But there's something different
about you from the other Namekians.

123
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:13,245
There seems to be something special about you.

124
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:17,455
And even so, you are
still utterly no match for me.

125
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:33,395
<i>Who is it? Who has arrived? I don't know.</i>

126
00:19:33,435 --> 00:19:35,735
<i>I can't tell whose ki that is.</i>

127
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:40,405
<i>Piccolo? No, can't be. It couldn't be.</i>

128
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,745
<i>The ki's too great to be Piccolo's.</i>

129
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:46,075
<i>Gohan's ki has recovered as well.</i>

130
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:49,285
<i>I don't get anything that's going on!</i>

131
00:20:00,135 --> 00:20:04,695
Now, to clean up the dregs of the universe.

132
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,075
I'll do this by myself. You guys stay out of it.

133
00:20:10,075 --> 00:20:14,745
That person they call Piccolo,
he looks just like Nail<i>-san</i>!

134
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,725
Take shelter somewhere, Dende!

135
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,925
You'll get caught in our crossfire.

136
00:20:32,095 --> 00:20:33,765
Do it quickly!

137
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:38,765
How does he know my name?

138
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:51,745
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

139
00:20:56,425 --> 00:21:01,555
It's senseless! Not even Piccolo has
a chance of winning against that guy!

140
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,725
He may have a glib tongue,

141
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:06,225
but so long as he doesn't
realize his opponent's battle power,

142
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,595
I wouldn't count on him.

143
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:14,765
<i>Everyone has stopped moving.</i>

144
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:17,275
<i>Now what's going on?!</i>

145
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:22,935
<i>Who is it that just showed</i>
<i>up with the enormous ki?</i>

146
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:12,395
<i>Piccolo finally arrives at the scene of battle.</i>

147
00:22:12,435 --> 00:22:16,725
<i>His challenge to Freeza</i>
<i>may be thought of as reckless.</i>

148
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:21,505
<i>Does Piccolo indeed have a chance of winning?</i>

149
00:22:21,545 --> 00:22:24,775
<i>And what about Goku?</i>

150
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:48,395
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

151
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:54,235
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

152
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:56,605
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

153
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:05,105
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

154
