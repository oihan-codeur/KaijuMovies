<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,230
Im... possible...!

17
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:06,000
And you call yourself a Super Saiyan?

18
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,740
<i>Freeza conceals bottomless power.</i>

19
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,550
<i>Can it be that even with Vegeta's</i>
<i>explosive power-up, he is no match for Freeza?</i>

20
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,880
<i>"How I've Waited for this Moment!!!</i>
<i>Son Goku Revived."</i>

21
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,060
Running away?

22
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,580
What?!

23
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,350
No way!

24
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,430
<i>His speed is...</i>

25
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,770
Damn! To think that Freeza
still hasn't gone all-out yet...

26
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,400
What a monster!

27
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,880
Vegeta, quite frankly, using
the attacks and speed you just did,

28
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,580
there's no way you can win against me.

29
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,390
As I recall, you said something
about being a Super Saiyan.

30
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,390
If you are as you say,

31
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,770
does that mean that's the best
the "strongest in history" can do?

32
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,290
<i>Up until this point, I could see him...</i>

33
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,730
Don't make me laugh.

34
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:59,680
The Super Saiyan is then no
more than a trivial legend after all.

35
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,010
<i>Does this mean I've reached my limit?</i>

36
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,050
<i>Have I not yet become a Super Saiyan?</i>

37
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,620
<i>Or for that matter, is Freeza an</i>
<i>opponent not even a Super Saiyan can beat?</i>

38
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,400
Nonsense! There's no
reason that should be so!

39
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,070
Vegeta...

40
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,070
How can such a thing be?!

41
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,410
Such a thing... could never be!!

42
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,400
<i>You fool.</i>

43
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,410
I see you!

44
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,420
I see you, Freeza!

45
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,250
Vegeta, you...

46
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,430
<i>Vegeta isn't blasting away blindly,</i>
<i>he's carefully aiming every shot!</i>

47
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,240
<i>And yet Freeza is decidedly</i>
<i>keeping clear of them.</i>

48
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,610
<i>They're both unbelievable!</i>

49
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,940
Piccolo...

50
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,220
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

51
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,400
What?!

52
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,160
I-I am...

53
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,740
I <i>am</i> a Super Saiyan!

54
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,870
Burn in Hell, Freeza!

55
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,530
Are you trying to destroy
the whole planet, Vegeta?!

56
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,720
What?!

57
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,500
It's just about time, I suppose.

58
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,200
I can't have him getting too carried away.

59
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,540
H-How could he...?

60
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:11,710
He bounced all that
back with just a simple kick?!

61
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,050
Vegeta had to have launched
that attack at his full power!

62
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,690
He's incredible! He's more than incredible!

63
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:26,070
And now, you will experience
a pain even greater than hell.

64
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,300
This time, you'll let me lead off.

65
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,240
Mildly.

66
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,080
<i>Vegeta...</i>

67
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,080
<i>For the first time in his life, Vegeta is</i>
<i>trembling, from the bottom of his heart.</i>

68
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,760
<i>Both from genuine terror, and</i>
<i>from his conclusive frustration.</i>

69
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,740
<i>He's even shedding tears</i>
<i>over his fright and hopelessness.</i>

70
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,770
<i>This is another first.</i>

71
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,080
Here goes. Are you ready?

72
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,880
<i>Vegeta–Vegeta has</i>
<i>already lost the will to fight.</i>

73
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,240
Vegeta!

74
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,450
Don't!

75
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,090
He's had it.

76
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,740
Vegeta, I can't have
you giving up after so little.

77
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,110
You'll have to go through more than this...

78
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,080
...for a terror greater than hell's.

79
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:56,060
Well? Have you started to
regret how foolish you've been?

80
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,440
You lower-life-form, nothing-in-
your-mind-but-fighting Saiyan<i>-san</i>?

81
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,650
I thought you at least were
different, and I pampered you,

82
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,850
but you're just like the others who
performed their foolishness, aren't you?

83
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,760
If you hadn't turned against me,

84
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,740
we would have gotten by
without having to go through this.

85
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,760
V-Vegeta!

86
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,690
If you want to save him, feel free at any time.

87
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,800
<i>Piccolo and the others,</i>

88
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,170
<i>faced with the terror of Freeza, whose</i>
<i>battle power is of a different dimension,</i>

89
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:54,010
<i>seem to be bound in place or something,</i>
<i>all three of them unable to move.</i>

90
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,120
<i>Vegeta's ki is rapidly shrinking...</i>

91
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,260
<i>and he was supposed to</i>
<i>have gotten incredibly stronger.</i>

92
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,740
<i>Is this Freeza that strong?!</i>

93
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,740
<i>I'm healed!</i>

94
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,060
<i>I've gotten stronger!</i>

95
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,430
<i>It's like the power is welling up inside!</i>

96
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,540
<i>Unbelievable! And here</i>
<i>I thought I'd reached my limit.</i>

97
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,070
<i>It's enough to scare me!</i>

98
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,210
<i>But you know, it feels good!</i>

99
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,380
<i>Even at a terrible time like this.</i>

100
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,720
<i>My apologies, Gohan, Kuririn, and Piccolo!</i>

101
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,420
<i>I'm coming now! Something</i>
<i>might just become of this!</i>

102
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,930
<i>Goku at last recovers.</i>

103
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,230
<i>How eagerly has this</i>
<i>moment been anticipated?</i>

104
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,070
<i>You're the only one left</i>

105
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,480
<i>who can still offer resistance to</i>
<i>the overwhelming power of Freeza!</i>

106
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,650
<i>We're counting on you, Goku!</i>

107
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

108
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

109
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

110
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

111
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

112
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

113
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

114
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

115
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

116
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

117
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

118
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

119
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

120
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

121
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

122
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

123
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,270
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

124
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,370
<i>Vegeta, for you to cry...</i>

125
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,380
<i>for you to beg of me, must</i>
<i>have been awfully difficult, I bet.</i>

126
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:27,280
<i>Kakarrot... defeat Freeza</i>
<i>for me... by your Saiyan hand...</i>

127
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,450
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

128
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:33,290
<i>"Such Regret...!!</i>
<i>Vegeta, Pride of the Saiyans, Dies."</i>

129
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,430
<i>Freeza is afraid of Saiyans!</i>

130
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,230
"Next time"
"Such Regret...!!
Vegeta, Pride of the Saiyans, Dies"
