<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,510
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:29,760
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:36,520
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:43,070
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:51,950
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,450
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:04,460
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,930
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:14,060
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,430
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:26,400
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,950
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,830
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,790
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,220
<i>With his all of his remaining power,</i>

17
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,180
<i>Vegeta launched his Final Flash at Cell.</i>

18
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:21,080
<i>However, not even that ultimate finishing</i>
<i>technique was of any use against him.</i>

19
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,410
<i>And now, with his father Vegeta in crisis,</i>

20
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:07,500
<i>Trunks has unleashed ultra power that</i>
<i>goes far beyond the Super Saiyan wall!</i>

21
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,640
<i>"Save Your Father!! Trunks' Fury,</i>
<i>Which Scorches Even the Heavens."</i>

22
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,570
What's this?

23
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,340
Trunks!

24
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,360
H-He still hasn't gotten
fired up, yet what a terrifying <i>ki</i>!

25
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,070
W-What is going on with these Saiyans?

26
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:12,880
Every time an awesome opponent
appears, they rapidly get much stronger!

27
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,300
Are there no limits to the warrior Saiyan race?

28
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,140
What sort of guys are they?

29
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,860
Kuririn-<i>san...</i>

30
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,860
Would you take Dad,

31
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,490
and go to Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>'s
place or somewhere for me?

32
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,450
Thank goodness.

33
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,700
You can talk like normal, then.

34
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,210
I was worried that you had gone nuts,

35
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,580
like Goku and the others did
when they became great apes.

36
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,290
I'm all right. Never mind me, here...

37
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,800
When you think the timing
is right, give that senzu to Dad.

38
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,810
S-Sure. But are you sure you're okay?

39
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,270
Are you sure you have a senzu for yourself?

40
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,650
I will not need a senzu for myself,

41
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,860
because I will be sure to win.

42
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:26,870
F-For him to say something like
that, he's awfully sure of himself.

43
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:02,360
<i>He's strong! So he's been keeping</i>
<i>all that potential strength hidden?</i>

44
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,090
I will kill you, Cell.

45
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,220
That's a pretty aggressive statement, Trunks.

46
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,970
They've vanished!

47
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,980
Above me!

48
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,000
W-What?

49
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,180
D-Don't tell me that he's defeated Cell, there!

50
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,030
W-What the hell kind of training did he do

51
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,030
in the Room of Spirit and Time?

52
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,500
Gohan, anything goes. Try to catch me.

53
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,880
All right!

54
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,250
That was a good reading!

55
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,580
But you've still got a soft touch!

56
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,760
That was close, that was close!

57
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,500
Father!

58
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,050
Caught you!

59
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,300
Oh, my...

60
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:35,590
You did good, huh Gohan?

61
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,760
Yes!

62
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,150
However, we overdid it, didn't we?

63
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,150
I-I got all caught up in it, and all...

64
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,150
We'll have to fix this, or
we'll have Popo mad at us!

65
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,360
Right!

66
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,700
H-He did it!

67
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,080
Awesome! That Trunks...

68
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,300
saying he's gotten stronger doesn't even cover it!

69
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,010
He's defeated that monster–Cell!

70
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,470
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, watch out!

71
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,810
W-What?!

72
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,120
You're something else, Trunks.

73
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,790
Damn! Cell is still alive and kicking!

74
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,960
That settles it!

75
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,340
What kind of power is this?

76
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,530
I might have known!

77
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,240
To think that you could
dodge me by a hair's breadth!

78
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,740
T-Trunks!

79
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,480
T-This is hopeless...

80
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,090
<i>I-Is that it?</i>

81
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,880
<i>This is to allow me to rescue Vegeta.</i>

82
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,780
So this is the result of your allowing
Cell to become his perfect form,

83
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,490
for your pride's sake?

84
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,040
Trunks is now fighting at incredible power!

85
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,380
He's gotten a lot stronger than you have.

86
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,850
And the reason I can't
watch this magnificent fight,

87
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,230
it's all due to your ridiculous pride!

88
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:20,040
For my part, I wouldn't
care if you weren't around...

89
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,420
...but as far as Trunks goes,
that doesn't seem to be so.

90
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:42,980
Really, what does he see in a father like this?

91
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,050
Now, can you finally fight
without any other concerns?

92
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,180
Vegeta has been taken away, and all...

93
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,970
S-So you knew?

94
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,480
Of course.

95
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,190
As well as knowing you were moving
me away from Vegeta on purpose.

96
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,270
This is unexpected!

97
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:10,190
To think that you would let him go knowingly!

98
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,690
Naturally. My interests no longer lie with him.

99
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,240
They lie in your true power.

100
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,100
I didn't think you knew so much.

101
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,560
I look forward to this.

102
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,690
The time for me to know the
strength of this perfect form has come.

103
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,370
W-What power he has!

104
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,250
He's far exceeded Super Vegeta!

105
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,090
Is this it?

106
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,220
Is this the Saiyan power
that goes beyond Super Saiyan,

107
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,100
that Goku was talking about?

108
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:07,480
<i>As Super Trunks finally reveals</i>
<i>himself, he demonstrates ultra-power!</i>

109
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:16,150
<i>Will this power be able to rise</i>
<i>above the perfect form of Cell?</i>

110
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,390
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

111
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,230
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

112
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,610
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

113
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,110
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

114
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,580
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

115
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,710
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

116
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,210
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

117
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,840
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

118
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,350
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

119
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,440
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

120
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,270
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

121
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,280
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

122
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:44,950
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

123
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,120
<i>So sorry.</i>

124
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,290
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

125
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,290
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

126
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,850
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

127
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,310
<i>Trunks, what happened in the future,</i>
<i>where Vegeta and me are dead?</i>

128
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,610
<i>The Artificial Humans were strong.</i>

129
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,190
<i>The warriors that stood up to them</i>

130
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,030
<i>were all killed by their tremendous power.</i>

131
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,490
<i>Even Gohan-san!</i>

132
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,620
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

133
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,120
<i>"A Future of Despair!!</i>
<i>Trunks, the Man Who Lived Through Hell."</i>

134
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,580
<i>I won't leave the earth to the</i>
<i>whims of the Artificial Humans!</i>

135
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,660
"Next time"
"A Future of Despair!!
Trunks, the Man Who Lived Through Hell"
