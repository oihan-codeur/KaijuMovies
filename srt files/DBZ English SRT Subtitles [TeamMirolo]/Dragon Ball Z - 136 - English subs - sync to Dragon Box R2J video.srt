<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245

16
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:52,805

Are you all right?!

20
00:03:20,165 --> 00:03:22,025
Get this straight.

21
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:24,235
If it comes down to fighting
alongside Earthlings, or Namekians,

22
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:26,735
or Kakarrot, for that matter...

23
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:30,075
...I'd rather fight by myself and die!

24
00:03:32,945 --> 00:03:39,145
I don't think anyone here would interfere
in Vegeta and No. 18's one-on-one fight,

25
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,885
but if you do...

26
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:45,455
...I will have to join in as well.

27
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,285

00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,445
Dad!

30
00:05:19,155 --> 00:05:20,485
Dammit!

31
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:21,455
No you don't!

32
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:29,465
O-One blow! And he was even a Super Saiyan!

33
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:55,085
Damn you!

34
00:06:39,905 --> 00:06:42,305
How incredibly strong!

35
00:07:25,115 --> 00:07:28,175
What's up with him?

36
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:44,185
Dammit!

37
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:10,445
Looks like I'd better make sure
you can't use your other arm, either.

38
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:41,045
His hair color changed back,
and that strange glow is gone too.

39
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,945
Pretty unusual phenomenon, I'd say.

40
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:45,145
The one over there was the same way.

41
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,855
So what is it about him, then?

42
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,555
I've got no data on this.

43
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:00,895
Not that it's important.

44
00:10:05,135 --> 00:10:08,105
E-Everyone's been beaten!

45
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:16,135
Maron<i>-chan</i>, well done, well done–!

46
00:11:24,955 --> 00:11:27,145
Hey, sugar. How are you?

47
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:29,545
Hi!

48
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:34,155
Hey, baby, how about
having some fun together?

49
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,955
Come on aboard!

50
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:38,985
I'll be happy to!

51
00:11:47,545 --> 00:11:49,945
Help!

52
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:08,595
Help!

53
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:15,965
What a racket...

54
00:12:22,145 --> 00:12:25,505
Maron<i>-chan</i>, are you okay?

55
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:29,505
Maron thought she was going
to die. Thanks, Turtle<i>-chan.</i>

56
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:33,115
Hey, baby! How about taking
a ride with us in the boat?

57
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:36,125
Hi, come on, over here!

58
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,955
Maron will take that ride!

59
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,125
Turtle<i>-chan</i>, what are you doing?

60
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,525
You mustn't, Maron<i>-chan.</i>

61
00:12:49,565 --> 00:12:53,565
You're waiting for Kuririn to return, aren't you?

62
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,435
Oh, that's right.

63
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:01,105
That's right, I'm waiting for Kurin<i>-chan–</i>

64
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,905
Yo, honey!

65
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,245
Come aboard with us!

66
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:10,115
Honey, let's go get something to drink! Yeah?

67
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,485
Sure, but...

68
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,555
Then we'll get some cake,
something sweet to eat, right?

69
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:17,995
How's that sound?

70
00:13:18,535 --> 00:13:20,765
Huh? What's your problem?

71
00:13:30,945 --> 00:13:35,215
Puny turtle, you're going to get hurt
if you try to mess with us human beings.

72
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:48,785
You rotten punk!

73
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:39,945
Turtle<i>-chan</i>, you're so strong!

74
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,085
I like my men strong.

75
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:10,565
Turtle<i>-chan</i>!

76
00:15:13,315 --> 00:15:17,275
You mustn't! You have Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

77
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:23,555
Kuririn<i>-san</i>! K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

78
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:27,725
Kuririn this, Kuririn that, I'm tired of hearing it!

79
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:30,955
Kuririn's not the only man out there, you know!

80
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,975
Maron<i>-chan...</i>

81
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,595
Damn, you expect me to be beaten too?

82
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:12,735
Don't worry. They're all still alive.

83
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:16,105
Hurry and feed them those senzu whatsits.

84
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:18,545
They should recover completely.

85
00:16:20,175 --> 00:16:22,775
Tell them that if they manage to toughen up any,

86
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,945
we're willing to take them on again.

87
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,815
See you.

88
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:39,925
Aren't you going to ask where Son Goku is?

89
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:45,965
No worry. It'll be more fun
seeking it out for ourselves.

90
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:51,915
Besides, if we smash things
around enough, he'll come to us.

91
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:57,145
Bye.

92
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:09,525
You're so bratty, No. 17.

93
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:11,155
You think so?

94
00:17:21,345 --> 00:17:24,305
What are you looking at, No. 16?

95
00:17:24,345 --> 00:17:29,145
You guys made all that noise,
so the little birds flew away.

96
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,075
Little birds?

97
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,745
Say, not too many cars pass through here.

98
00:17:33,785 --> 00:17:36,755
Let's fly off to somewhere a little more busy.

99
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:02,105
<i>Goku-sa seems to be feelin' better.</i>

100
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:15,695
Come to think of it,
what's Gohan<i>-chan</i> doin' now?

101
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,535
Look! We're almost there!

102
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:38,145
Hold on a second. Go to my home first.

103
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:44,155
But there are things
I need to tell Father right away.

104
00:18:44,195 --> 00:18:48,485
You have no idea how it
feels to be a "Young Missus."

105
00:18:48,525 --> 00:18:52,095
You're just like your father in that way.

106
00:18:52,135 --> 00:18:55,965
You're the type who's going to
have a hard time with women later on.

107
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,495
It's a real struggle being a young mother.

108
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:01,835
There's so much I have to do for Trunks,

109
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,105
like change him and
prepare his milk and so on.

110
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:09,245
She's right. There'll be
more, better chow there too.

111
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:11,115
Head to Bulma's home.

112
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:17,985
W-Well, okay then.
We'll go to Bulma<i>-san</i>'s home.

113
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:43,145
There sure aren't any
cars coming through here.

114
00:19:43,185 --> 00:19:47,445
No choice but to fly
on to somewhere busier.

115
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,285
That's fine with me.

116
00:19:49,325 --> 00:19:52,815
I want to get some new clothes too.

117
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:56,995
Great. So, let's go find a nearby town.

118
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:01,995
W-Wait!

119
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:08,195
What, you have some other errand with us?

120
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:13,705
What is it you guys are after?

121
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,175
Are you just out to kill Goku?

122
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:19,175
Or are you just out to
turn the world upside-down?

123
00:20:19,215 --> 00:20:22,415
For now, we're going to defeat Son Goku.

124
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,015
We'll think about what
to do next after we're done.

125
00:20:25,055 --> 00:20:28,085
But why?! Why go after Goku?

126
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:38,095
You guys killed Doctor Gero,
when he was the one who hated him!

127
00:20:38,135 --> 00:20:40,975
Doctor Gero doesn't figure into this.

128
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:44,705
This is all just a game.

129
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,275
A game, you say?

130
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:50,715
That's the only purpose for all this?

131
00:20:50,755 --> 00:20:56,415
I said we didn't need to ask you where
Son Goku was, right? This is the reason.

132
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:59,255
Looking for him is part of the game.

133
00:21:01,265 --> 00:21:06,295
S-Suppose, then, I were to ask you to stop.

134
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:08,135
Would it be any use?

135
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:22,305
It wouldn't be any use.
We were created to kill Son Goku.

136
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:24,575
Like he said.

137
00:21:32,955 --> 00:21:37,525
You'd better hurry and feed
them those senzu. They'll die soon.

138
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:45,765
See ya. Bye.
