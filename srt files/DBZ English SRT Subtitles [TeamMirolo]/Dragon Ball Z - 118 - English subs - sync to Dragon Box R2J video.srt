6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200

<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,370
What's up with Father, anyhow?

17
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:59,370
It's been a year now.

18
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,900
Maybe he doesn't want to come back to Earth.

Shoot!

24
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,630
It's no use. At my level...

25
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,200
...I don't even hold a candle to Goku.

26
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,870
The time when I, Muten Roshi,

27
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,810
could be hailed as the greatest
under the sun is now a thing of the past.

28
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,510
Yeah, and now you're no more
than a simple, dirty old man.

29
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,520
<i>Goku must be off in space</i>
<i>somewhere, continuing his training.</i>

30
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,060
<i>Roughly one year's time has passed since</i>
<i>Son Goku, having become a Super Saiyan,</i>

31
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,360
<i>and waging the most difficult of battles,</i>

32
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,060
<i>had managed to defeat Freeza in</i>
<i>an incredible display of strength.</i>

33
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,900
<i>However, Son Goku had</i>
<i>still not returned to Earth.</i>

34
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,540
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, are ya studyin'?

35
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,910
Mother!

36
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,780
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, what are ya doin'?

37
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,420
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, this is Shu Saiaku-sensei,

38
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:33,090
a private tutor who startin'
today'll be helpin' with your studyin'.

39
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,830
Private tutor?

40
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,530
Lately, you've been goofin' off too much,

41
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,530
an' you've gotten too
far behind in your studyin'.

42
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,500
Startin' today, I'm havin' the Sensei
here strictly oversee your learnin'.

43
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,840
Mother, I can do this on my own!

44
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,540
No way! Soon you'd be off
playin' with Haiya Dragon!

45
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,540
With Goku<i>-sa</i> not coming home in all this time,

46
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,550
an' with my good looks an'
youth, to feel like a thermos...

47
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,080
I mean, a widow...

48
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,590
...is a terrible thing.

49
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,090
I don't have anyone I can
count on except you, Gohan<i>-chan.</i>

50
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,560
I want you to do everythin' the Sensei tells you.

51
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,060
Sensei<i>-sama</i>, please accept our request.

52
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,040
I am the strictest, most
superior private tutor in the world.

53
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,540
By obediently doing exactly as I say,

54
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,440
even the most stupid pupil can succeed.

55
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,050
Gohan<i>-chan</i> ain't stupid.

56
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,420
If you want to get into a good
school, you will submit to me!

57
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:40,290
Now then, we will begin with a test.

58
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,060
It sure is nice to be at peace.

59
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,400
I've been wondering, where do
you suppose Vegeta went off to?

60
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,570
Most likely he's flying around in
space, trying to catch up with Goku.

61
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,240
The guy is obsessed.

62
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,340
Just looking at him
makes chills go down my back!

63
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,350
If you look closer, you'll see he's a good guy.

64
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,080
Where do you see that? He's a spaceship thief!

65
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,520
To go through all that just to pursue
Goku, you have to admire his guts.

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,550
Hey, Bulma, are you...?

67
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:20,530
Yamucha, don't be jealous, don't be jealous!

68
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,930
Makes no difference to me.

69
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:26,540
From what Papa tells me,
he should be out of fuel soon.

70
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,010
I wonder if he found Son<i>-kun</i> or not.

71
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,550
Let's see, this is...

72
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:42,280
Can't you solve a problem as easy as this?

73
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,020
It's only a first year high school level problem!

74
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,390
Yeah, well I haven't learned this yet.

75
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,860
Don't talk back to me!

76
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,230
What kind of attitude is that?

77
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,570
I will not tolerate any
rebelliousness toward me!

78
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,570
Do you really want to
deny your mother her wishes?

79
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,450
Aw, crap...

80
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,220
Now Gohan<i>-chan</i> will be all right.

81
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,890
We're lucky to have found a good Sensei.

82
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,090
I'll cook them somethin' yummy.

83
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,530
Such a low level of intelligence!

84
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,770
Don't give me that impudent look!

85
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,050
You brat! Don't mess around with me.

86
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,050
Unbelievable.

87
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,250
I'd like to see the face of the
father that ran out on you two.

88
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,680
Haiya Dragon!

89
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:29,250
Haiya Dragon, we can't let
Mother or the private tutor find out.

90
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,690
Haiya Dragon, wait!

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,520
Hey, Gohan. How've you been?

92
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,910
Father!

93
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,920
Father!

94
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,690
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

95
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,550
Chichi! I just got back.

96
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,660
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

97
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,070
Chichi, I'm hungry.
Let me have something to eat.

98
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,710
Goku<i>-sa</i>, it's bad manners
to go in through a window.

99
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,180
What'll we do if Gohan starts doin' it too?

100
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,280
Chichi, less formality, more food!

101
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,550
Okay, then!

102
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,550
I'll put all my skill into makin' you somethin'!

103
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:09,060
Father, tell me a story about
how you fought with Freeza!

104
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,560
What have you been
doing up until now? Hm? Hm?

105
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,090
How did you get back? Hm?

106
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:16,900
Tell me?

107
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,740
Father, tell me!

108
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,560
Let go of me, kid!

109
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,560
Let go! Owww, let go, kid!

110
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,570
Hey, kid! Let go! Let go of me!

111
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,600
Let go of my hand now!

112
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,370
You nasty brute!

113
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,080
If you've got that much
power, you don't need to nap,

114
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,090
you should be applying
that power to your studies!

115
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,580
Oh, it was a dream?

116
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,590
Well, I guess I should have expected as much
from the son of a man who is so inhuman,

117
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,060
someone who directs all his attention to
his own physical strengths, isn't that right?

118
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,760
Well, you lousy dropout?

119
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,030
What are you looking at me like that for?!

120
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,730
I thought I told you to submit to me!

121
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,780
Stop talking badly about my father!

122
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,850
Stop talking badly... about him.

123
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,510
Stop this.

124
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,650
I won't let you talk badly about Father!

125
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,520
Stop this! I am your private tutor!

126
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,530
Ma'am! Gohan<i>-kun</i> is having a tantrum!

127
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,200
Gohan, what are you doin' to the Sensei?

128
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,900
Mother!

129
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,720
What kind of parenting are you
doing to be raising a child like this?

130
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,590
Indeed! Such a rebellious nature
as this is out of the ordinary.

131
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,190
How dare you look at me like that?

132
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,860
Gohan...

133
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,030
This is all your father's fault,
him not coming home.

134
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,870
Goku<i>-sa</i>'s fault?!

135
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,870
That's right! It's his father's fault!

136
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,870
This has nothing to do with Father!

137
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,110
You be quiet!

138
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,720
This is the second year now that
you haven't heard from him, isn't it?

139
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,390
How incredibly thoughtless of him!

140
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,020
Stop talking badly about Father!

141
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,230
But, since this is my job, if you
were to ask me to teach a pig...

142
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:01,260
or for that matter,
a monkey, I would teach them.

143
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:07,570
You'll have to provide five times
my usual tutoring fee, though.

144
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,740
Gohan<i>-kun</i> is even harder to
teach than a monkey, you see.

145
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,790
And he has no real potential...

146
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,760
You've had your say,
now get the hell outta here!

147
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,400
Mother!

148
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,400
Gohan...

149
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,700
The blame for that brat's poor
upbringing lies not only with his father,

150
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,400
but even more so with his mother!

151
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
You shut up!

152
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Oh, dear! The spaceship thief has returned!

153
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,170
Vegeta! What do you want?!

154
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,940
Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

155
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,380
I see Kakarrot hasn't returned yet.

156
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,880
You mean you didn't meet
up with Goku out in space?

157
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,860
I don't have any compelling need to answer you.

158
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,360
Hey, hey, that's enough talk, you two.

159
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,700
Why don't we let him take a shower?

160
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,410
See? You're so dirty, aren't you?

161
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,410
So, it's this way.

162
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:04,490
Well, hurry up! You're being
impolite in front of a Lady.

163
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,520
What?!

164
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,190
What's this?

165
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,190
Vegeta is at her mercy.

166
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,330
So, anyone for tea?

167
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,910
I've left you something to change into here.

168
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,230
<i>Kakarrot, hurry up and get back here.</i>

169
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,700
<i>Show me the power of a Super Saiyan.</i>

170
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,210
Oh, so it was Vegeta, was it?

171
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,710
And here I came over,
certain that it was Goku instead.

172
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,810
Even now, the only thing Vegeta
seems to have on his mind is Goku.

173
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,720
I don't suppose he's ever
worn our kind of clothes, huh?

174
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,450
There's no way to know.

175
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,720
Hey, woman!

176
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,230
Uh...

177
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,730
Woman!

178
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,360
Hey!

179
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,900
Can't you hear me, Earth woman?

180
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,570
Now listen here! My name is "Bulma"!

181
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,770
Call me by my name, you boor.

182
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,440
What have you done with my clothes?

183
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,710
They were dirty, so I put them in the wash.

184
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,220
You did what?!

185
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,220
You've got a change
of clothes there, right?

186
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,790
You presume to make me,
the prince of the warrior Saiyan race,

187
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:49,720
wear something like this?!

188
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,730
Well then, how about going naked?

189
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,670
Man, what a vulgar woman!

190
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,180
Why, you...

191
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:15,660
Oh, my, it suits you better than I thought!

192
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,020
Don't laugh!

193
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,550
If you value your lives, don't laugh!

194
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,200
Until Son<i>-kun</i> gets back,

195
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,570
how about staying here?

196
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,200
That's a brave front, but I bet
you don't have any money, do you?

197
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,740
And if you stay here, you'll know
right away when Son<i>-kun</i> comes back.

198
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,730
It's your own fault for
hirin' that private tutor, Chichi!

199
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,070
An' on the other hand, I bet
the tutor sure was surprised, huh?

200
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,050
Gohan<i>-chan</i>'s studyin'.

201
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,920
Oh, that's right! But I still bet that
private tutor was really surprisified!

202
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,170
Pa! Can'tcha be more quiet?

203
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,420
Can you feel it, Gohan? That incredible <i>ki</i>?

204
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,090
Yes.

205
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,230
This... isn't a very good <i>ki</i>, is it?

206
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,110
It's awful! And it's approaching fast.

207
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,710
You must also be vaguely sensing this–

208
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,220
This <i>ki</i>, it belongs to Freeza, doesn't it?

209
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,690
It couldn't be.

210
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,220
And yet, it certainly does...

211
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:49,440
Impossible! I'm certain
that Goku took care of Freeza!

212
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,250
It's not just one... there's
another... impossibly large <i>ki.</i>

213
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,120
How can this be?

214
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,190
Kakarrot, you scum!

215
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,260
You didn't finish him off!

216
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:18,200
This <i>ki</i>, are you sure it's Freeza?

217
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,200
You think I could be mistaken about this?

218
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,200
Under what stupid reasoning?

219
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,710
What did you say?!

220
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,080
Vegeta! This isn't stupid
reasoning, it's <i>Yakiniku</i> seasoning!

221
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,720
I have a feeling that even if the
Earth were gone, Bulma would survive.

222
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,740
How can this be?

223
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,740
That there is Earth, Papa.

224
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,380
It looks as though we've arrived here...

225
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,510
...before the Super Saiyan
that did all this to me has.

226
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:10,420
It's a small planet.

227
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,560
We could blow it away
with one blast if we wanted.

228
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,730
If we did that, I wouldn't be satisfied.

229
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,230
I want to teach him a lesson.

230
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:25,210
Now that I'm powered up like this.

231
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,440
You mean this "Super Saiyan" guy?

232
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,010
<i>I can tell by the radar here,</i>

233
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,720
<i>that you're also on a course towards Earth.</i>

234
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,220
<i>I'll make you understand soon enough.</i>

235
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,780
Just who the strongest
being in the universe really is!

236
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:57,260
This is terrible. This is terrible. This is terrible.

237
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,270
This is terrible. This is terrible.

238
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,110
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

239
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,280
Hold on, Gohan<i>-chan</i>, where are ya going?!

240
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,210
Today I'm having a new
private tutor come over.

241
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,720
<i>Freeza was supposed to be dead, but</i>
<i>instead he's returned in a powered-up form!</i>

242
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,720
<i>Once again, with Goku still away,</i>

243
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,890
<i>the Earth stands in the shadow</i>
<i>of an approaching great evil.</i>

244
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:28,430
<i>Goku, hurry back home!</i>

245
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,280
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

246
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,120
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

247
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,490
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

248
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,000
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

249
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,510
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

250
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,610
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

251
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,110
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

252
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,750
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

253
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,260
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

254
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,330
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

255
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,160
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

256
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

257
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,870
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

258
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:47,040
<i>So sorry.</i>

259
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,180
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

260
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,190
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

261
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,870
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

262
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,740
<i>Looks like that Freeza jerk is</i>
<i>completely unrepentant, huh?</i>

263
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,670
<i>But be careful, guys.</i>

264
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,380
<i>If Freeza wanted to, he</i>
<i>could blow the whole earth up!</i>

265
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:25,210
<i>D-Damn. I've just been brought back to life,</i>

266
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,180
<i>and now I have to die again?</i>

267
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

268
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:33,220
<i>"I Will Defeat Freeza...</i>
<i>The Mysterious Youth Awaiting Goku."</i>

269
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,100
<i>That man reminds me of someone.</i>

270
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,900
"Next time"
"I Will Defeat Freeza...
The Mysterious Youth Awaiting Goku"
