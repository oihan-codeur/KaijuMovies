3
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:30,165
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:36,865
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:43,475
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:52,345
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,895 --> 00:01:04,865
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:08,335
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:14,405
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12

<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,135
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:16,935
<i>At last, the mighty</i>
<i>Saiyans had arrived on Earth.</i>

17
00:02:16,975 --> 00:02:20,275
<i>However, even though Goku,</i>
<i>upon whom everyone was relying,</i>

18
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:22,335
<i>had been returned to</i>
<i>life with the Dragon Balls,</i>

19
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:27,915
<i>it would still take him one day to</i>
<i>travel back home along the Serpentine Road.</i>

20
00:02:27,955 --> 00:02:33,895
<i>Will the Earth be safe until Goku returns?</i>

21
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:42,295
<i>"Unbelievable! Saibaimen, Born of the Soil."</i>

22
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:45,325
It's a person!

23
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,965
There's–there's a person coming out of it!

24
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:11,885
W-What do those guys want?!

25
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,365
Who are they?

26
00:03:13,865 --> 00:03:18,895
"Earth," they called it, right?
Not a bad planet, is it?

27
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:23,205
Shall we say hello to those
annoying, peeping little chicks?

28
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,235
Not too hard, now.

29
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:41,915
What was that?!

30
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,525
W-What the hell did they do?!

31
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:49,865
W-What the–?

32
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:51,925
I-It's unheard-of!

33
00:04:16,565 --> 00:04:20,355
Perhaps that greeting was a bit too polite.

34
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:24,125
Leave it at that, Nappa.
If we go at it too excessively,

35
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:26,125
we won't be able to sell
this planet for a high price.

36
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:27,535
O-Oh, yeah.

37
00:04:27,575 --> 00:04:31,565
Now that you mention it, we were going to
look for those whatever-they're-called balls,

38
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,935
which can grant us any wish, huh?

39
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:35,305
Dragon Balls.

40
00:04:35,345 --> 00:04:38,105
How about we first find
the one who killed Raditz,

41
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:41,115
and ask him about the Dragon Balls?

42
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,475
Sure.

43
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:47,315
Now, supposing that one of those
Dragon Ball things was in the area,

44
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:52,255
our wish for eternal life
would have been wiped out,

45
00:04:52,295 --> 00:04:55,655
thanks to that senseless "greeting" of yours.

46
00:04:55,695 --> 00:05:00,135
S-Sorry about that.
It completely slipped my mind.

47
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,835
Well, what's done is done.
First thing we need to do

48
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:06,305
is find the guy who has
the highest battle power.

49
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:12,515
He'll be the one who killed
Raditz. Either him, or Kakarrot's son.

50
00:05:15,955 --> 00:05:19,955
That's strange. I'm picking up
more than just one or two readings

51
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,725
that have a battle power higher than 1,000.

52
00:05:23,965 --> 00:05:25,485
What are they doing on this planet?

53
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,325
Don't panic. They're still no match for us.

54
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:33,235
In any case, find the one
who has the highest battle power.

55
00:05:37,975 --> 00:05:39,935
I found him!

56
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:43,345
There are two fairly
high battle powers together.

57
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:47,245
All right, Nappa, let's go have some fun.

58
00:06:00,165 --> 00:06:05,125
Currently, the cause of the
large-scale earthquake is a complete mystery.

59
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,365
All communications with Metro East,

60
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:10,335
which is thought to have been the
epicenter of this earthquake, have been cut off,

61
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,005
and the safety of its residents is in doubt.

62
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,905
T-They're finally here, are they?

63
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:20,915
Let's go help them out.
With this, I can tell where they are.

64
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:24,385
I-I'm going over my dead body!

65
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:31,925
I-I'm going! I'm sure
Yamucha<i>-sama</i> will be going, too!

66
00:06:31,965 --> 00:06:34,525
No, let's not.

67
00:06:34,565 --> 00:06:36,925
There's too great a difference in our levels.

68
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:40,365
Even if I did go, I'd just be in the way.

69
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:43,735
All we can do is pray
for their victory from here.

70
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:45,905
Y-You're probably right.

71
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:47,075
Right! Right!

72
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,245
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>, don't die!

73
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,845
Son<i>-kun</i>, get here soon!

74
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:54,645
Get here soon!

75
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:02,815
<i>Hold out until I get there, everyone!</i>

76
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:18,265
This is great! This planet
"Earth" here has fairly little gravity,

77
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:21,645
and we can move with no difficulty at all!

78
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:30,315
They're moving at incredible speed!

79
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:34,515
They're heading straight for that
area where those two other large <i>ki</i> are!

80
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,255
Is that where Tenshinhan<i>-san</i> and them are?

81
00:07:37,295 --> 00:07:40,725
Or is it where Piccolo and Goku's son are?

82
00:07:40,765 --> 00:07:43,925
They're coming. They intend to come here.

83
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:44,925
Right.

84
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,495
Chaozu, you stay here!

85
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:51,835
No way! I'm coming, too!
I trained hard, and I'm coming!

86
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,505
Together with you, Ten<i>-san</i>!

87
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:00,685
W-What the hell happened here?!

88
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:22,165
Er, the scene is more
terrible than you can imagine.

89
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:25,105
Metro East has been
wiped out without a trace.

90
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:27,505
What in the world could have happened here?

91
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,905
Chief, how is the investigation coming?

92
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,345
We haven't the faintest idea.

93
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:37,145
This ain't no ordinary case!

94
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,215
Who is that?

95
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:49,995
I knew it! So this was the Saiyans' doin'!

96
00:08:50,865 --> 00:08:54,495
Are they tellin' me I gotta
fight someone with this kinda power?!

97
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,235
H-Hey, you!

98
00:08:56,275 --> 00:09:00,335
What are you doing there?!
A-Are you the one who did this?!

99
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,505
You dimwit! There ain't
no way I coulda done this!

100
00:09:03,545 --> 00:09:07,675
If I had this sorta power,
I wouldn't be so scared, y'know?!

101
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:12,345
You know something, don't you?!

102
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,355
Chief!

103
00:09:13,395 --> 00:09:13,915
Hey!

104
00:09:13,955 --> 00:09:17,525
This was done by aliens,
who're called "Saiyans"!

105
00:09:17,565 --> 00:09:20,155
W-What?! Aliens?!

106
00:09:20,195 --> 00:09:25,365
They're fixin' to exterminate
everyone on Earth! Every last one!

107
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:32,005
My boys're fightin' 'em right now for
ya, to make sure they don't get their way.

108
00:09:32,045 --> 00:09:33,205
Ya got that?!

109
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:48,355
Of all things!

110
00:09:48,395 --> 00:09:52,255
Come on, now, it's dangerous
for the general public to be here!

111
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:54,055
Go home! Go home!

112
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,255
There <i>are</i> guys like this one
running around out there, you know.

113
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:58,025
True, true...

114
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:03,095
All right then, you guys! How do
<i>you</i> explain this weird situation?! Eh?!

115
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,875
'sides, look over there at those!

116
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:09,535
Kind of large for basketballs, aren't they?

117
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,275
You stupid numbskull!

118
00:10:11,315 --> 00:10:13,045
N-Numbskull?!

119
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:16,245
Those're the spaceships
that the Saiyans came in!

120
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,945
–Spaceships?!
–Spaceships?!
–Spaceships?!

121
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,815
T-They couldn't be!

122
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:22,255
So check 'em out!

123
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:24,255
Hey, crime lab!

124
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:25,825
–Yes?
–Yes?

125
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:27,825
Examine–examine those things.

126
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,025
–Right!
–Right!

127
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:34,665
I'm from AHO TV. C-Come over here a second...

128
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:39,265
I'd like to hear all the details.

129
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,845
I tell ya, I sure am gettin' hungry, here...

130
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:46,675
–Y-You want an appearance fee?
–C-Chief!

131
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:50,285
T-This definitely is not of this earth!

132
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:51,315
W-What?!

133
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:58,325
I'll pay you whatever money you ask!
So, where are these Saiyan guys now?

134
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:02,495
AHO TV<i>-san</i>, you're not
getting the scoop on us!

135
00:11:02,535 --> 00:11:05,265
We'll pay as much as you like, too.

136
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:06,495
Us, too!

137
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:07,265
Us, as well!

138
00:11:07,305 --> 00:11:08,665
Us, too!

139
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:09,835
Me, too!

140
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:14,505
In that case, to keep ya all
from fightin', I'll tell ya all!

141
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:19,405
You can stick your wads of bills in here.

142
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:31,995
How's that?

143
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,745
I got it!

144
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,185
They're that way!

145
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:03,755
No, this way, this way!

146
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:06,755
Lessee...

147
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:11,265
About 6,000 kilometers in that direction.

148
00:12:11,305 --> 00:12:12,495
6,000 kilos?

149
00:12:12,535 --> 00:12:13,965
South, huh?

150
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,005
I won't steer ya wrong, though.
You'd best not get too close to 'em.

151
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:22,935
These're some pretty horrific guys, after all.

152
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:25,175
We're going to be the
first ones there, for sure!

153
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,705
No, we are!

154
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,745
We're leaving, too!

155
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:33,185
We're going to capture the aliens!

156
00:12:33,225 --> 00:12:35,185
Hunh, no hope for 'em.

157
00:12:35,225 --> 00:12:39,325
All right... I'm gonna eat my fill with this!

158
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:44,365
Could be the last meal
I ever eat in this world...

159
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:45,925
Prob'ly...

160
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:59,375
<i>The time was 12:20 p.m. The birds and animals</i>

161
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:05,415
<i>sensed a presence out of the</i>
<i>ordinary, and had begun leaving the area.</i>

162
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:20,735
There's nothing to be afraid of.

163
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:24,765
We've become so strong, it's
incomparable to what we were a year ago.

164
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,335
R-Right!

165
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:29,175
Something is coming this
way from that direction, too!

166
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,345
And someone is coming from over here, as well!

167
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:34,445
W-Weren't there only going to be two Saiyans?

168
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:37,345
A Saiyan?!

169
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:40,785
Hey, long time no see, Piccolo.

170
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:44,185
Oh, it's you, huh?

171
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:49,195
What business do you have here?
Did you come to get in our way?

172
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:53,095
Don't talk like that.
I've improved a little, myself.

173
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:58,665
So it appears. Looks like there are
some other fools who mean to come here.

174
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:03,775
Yeah, I'm sure everyone is coming.
I guess I was just the closest one.

175
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:07,445
I remember! You're one of the people
that was at the Turtle Hermit<i>-sama</i>'s place.

176
00:14:07,485 --> 00:14:11,785
Yeah, Kuririn. You've
beefed up quite a bit, haven't you?

177
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:14,085
You're just like Goku was, when he was a kid.

178
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:19,355
You're small, but strong, right?
Father said that about you a lot.

179
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:22,195
You're going to fight alongside us, right?

180
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:25,065
He didn't have to include that "small" part.

181
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:28,335
That jerk– he grows a little
bit taller, and thinks he's so big...

182
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,165
Still, it must have been rough,
having Piccolo train you like this, right?

183
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,235
Mm-hmm. But Piccolo<i>-san</i> is a
much better person than I thought.

184
00:14:37,215 --> 00:14:39,685
Enough chit-chat! They're here!

185
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,355
There they are, there they are!

186
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:54,695
There's one more of them
now, making three tough guys.

187
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:58,865
It appears that they know all about us.

188
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,765
T-Those are the Saiyans, huh?

189
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,765
Indeed, I can sense an
incredible <i>ki</i> from them.

190
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:09,475
D-Danger truly is closing in on us!

191
00:15:32,235 --> 00:15:34,605
It looks as though you've
been waiting anxiously for us.

192
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:38,905
You've got that right.

193
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,715
Just for the record, let me ask you,

194
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:52,315
what the hell have you come here for?

195
00:15:52,355 --> 00:15:53,315
That voice...

196
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:57,485
So, you're the one who defeated Raditz, right?

197
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:58,485
Voice?

198
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,695
Didn't Raditz tell you?

199
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,995
This acts as a communicator, too.

200
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:09,335
He's a Namekian!

201
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:15,335
So it would seem. I guess it's not
that surprising that Raditz was done in.

202
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,775
Namekian?

203
00:16:17,815 --> 00:16:22,775
Piccolo! Y-You're an alien, too?
That would explain...

204
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,375
I-Is that right, Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

205
00:16:27,395 --> 00:16:32,525
I get it. In addition to having
an unusually high battle power,

206
00:16:32,565 --> 00:16:35,295
I've heard that Namekians
have certain remarkable abilities.

207
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:41,165
<i>I'm a Namekian?</i>

208
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:47,475
I've also heard that there are some of
them that can perform magician-like feats.

209
00:16:51,145 --> 00:16:55,415
You must be the one who
created these Dragon Ball things.

210
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:59,345
Y-You even know about the Dragon Balls?!

211
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,815
The Dragon Balls are our first objective.

212
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,355
Hand them over to us
without making any trouble.

213
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:11,855
Even if you are Namekian, by yourself,
you're no more than a housefly to us.

214
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:19,335
Thanks. Because of you, I'm more-or-less
starting to understand my heritage.

215
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,405
But, unfortunately for you,

216
00:17:21,445 --> 00:17:24,205
I'm not the one who created the Dragon Balls.

217
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:30,015
I'm the kind that
specializes in fighting, you see.

218
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:35,515
Come try me, and we'll see
whether or not I'm a housefly!

219
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,425
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

220
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:47,495
I-I didn't know. To think that I am an alien...

221
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:52,705
No wonder I always felt so
different from everyone else.

222
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:58,375
I am definitely the one who
created the Dragon Balls long ago.

223
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:04,345
Even though it was the first time I had
ever made any, they seemed strangely familiar.

224
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:09,255
There was probably someone on Planet Namek

225
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:14,325
that also created
something like the Dragon Balls.

226
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:21,595
There were still memories of
my distant ancestors within me.

227
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,325
Pipe down!

228
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:54,035
It looks like you don't have any
intention of telling us about the Dragon Balls.

229
00:18:56,305 --> 00:19:00,335
Fine with me. You'll talk,
even if I have to force it out of you!

230
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,615
981...

231
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,015
1,220...

232
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,345
1,083...

233
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:15,015
Miserable fools! You plan on
facing us with that kind of battle power?

234
00:19:15,825 --> 00:19:16,785
Nappa,

235
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,355
take off your Scouter.

236
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:19,785
What?

237
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,925
These guys can alter their
battle powers in response to the battle.

238
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:27,165
We can't rely on these values anymore.

239
00:19:27,205 --> 00:19:29,165
Now that you mention it, that's right.

240
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:30,765
That idiotic wimp Raditz got done in

241
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:35,145
because he got overconfident
in his Scouter's figures, after all.

242
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,305
"T-That wimp Raditz"?

243
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,175
R-Raditz was that Saiyan

244
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,675
that you and Goku barely
managed to defeat together, right?

245
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,685
Wimp, huh?

246
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:56,125
I know–what do you say we have
ourselves a look at what they are capable of?

247
00:19:56,165 --> 00:20:01,695
Hey, Nappa, there are still six
Saibaimen left, right? Bring them out.

248
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:04,705
Vegeta, you sure do like
having a good time, huh?

249
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,465
S-Saibaiman?

250
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,205
W-What's that?

251
00:20:09,715 --> 00:20:12,175
Six of them, all right.

252
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,175
Once you see the Saibaimen,

253
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:17,445
I imagine you'll want to
tell us about the Dragon Balls.

254
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:23,085
This soil will grow some fine Saibaimen.

255
00:20:36,405 --> 00:20:39,105
W-What is that?

256
00:20:40,745 --> 00:20:42,215
All right!

257
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:58,595
T-Those guys are creepy!

258
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:48,105
T-These guys are pretty good!

259
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:49,665
So it would appear.

260
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:58,355
Those three are your targets.
Do them some harm, Saibaimen.

261
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:06,355
<i>Saibaimen, born of the soil...</i>

262
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:09,355
<i>Their power is the real deal.</i>

263
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,595
<i>Will Gohan...</i>

264
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:12,865
<i>...Kuririn...</i>

265
00:22:12,905 --> 00:22:20,205
<i>...and Piccolo be able to hold</i>
<i>out against them until Goku returns?</i>

266
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:49,035
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

267
00:22:49,075 --> 00:22:54,875
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

268
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,245
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

269
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:05,775
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

270
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:12,255
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

271
00:23:12,295 --> 00:23:16,355
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

272
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,865
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

273
00:23:19,905 --> 00:23:22,535
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

274
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:30,045
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

275
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:34,115
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

276
00:23:34,155 --> 00:23:35,945
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

277
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:40,015
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

278
00:23:40,055 --> 00:23:45,685
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

279
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:47,825
<i>So sorry.</i>

280
00:23:47,865 --> 00:23:52,925
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

281
00:23:55,675 --> 00:24:00,935
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

282
00:24:12,785 --> 00:24:14,755
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

283
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:16,615
<i>You came after all, Yamucha!</i>

284
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:21,455
<i>Relax. I'll put all of these</i>
<i>Saibaimen away in one shot.</i>

285
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:23,255
<i>All right, come and get it!</i>

286
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,465
<i>Yamucha! Don't take those guys too lightly!</i>

287
00:24:26,505 --> 00:24:28,565
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

288
00:24:28,605 --> 00:24:31,735
<i>"Yamucha Dies!</i>
<i>The Terror of the Saibaimen."</i>

289
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:35,305
<i>Father! Come quickly!</i>

290
00:24:35,345 --> 00:24:38,775
"Next time"
"Yamucha Dies!
The Terror of the Saibaimen"
