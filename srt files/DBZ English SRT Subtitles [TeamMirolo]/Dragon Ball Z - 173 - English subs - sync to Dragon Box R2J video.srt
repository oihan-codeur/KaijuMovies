<i>...they were unable to do</i>

<i>Elsewhere, Goku said...</i>

22
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,180
I'm going to head out for a bit,

23
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:55,690
in search of a Namekian who
will become our new Kami-<i>sama</i>!

24
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,350
Our Kami-<i>sama</i> will be restored,

25
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,940
and the Dragon Balls will be restored as well!

26
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,490
<i>In order to search out the</i>
<i>location of the new Planet Namek,</i>

27
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,440
<i>he instantaneously moved to Kaio's planet.</i>

28
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,290
Goku?

29
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,000
<i>"Dende's First Task!!</i>
<i>The Dragon Balls Restored."</i>

30
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,300
Good day!

31
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,300
Oh, how good of you to come,
how good of you to come!

32
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,480
Goku-<i>sa</i> went off somewhere
right in the middle of our drive!

33
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,730
What in the world is he thinkin'?!

34
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,740
Everyone throughout the
world, this is your Monarch.

35
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,160
A-As you have witnessed
from that earlier broadcast,

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:55,040
the combined forces of our military
were dealt a destructive blow by Cell.

37
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,620
I am accountable for everything.

38
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,920
I am terribly sorry.

39
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,130
There was nothing else
that we could have done.

40
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,670
To be completely honest,
there is nothing we can do.

41
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:11,720
However, please do not panic.

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,640
A savior, such as the young boy who
defeated Piccolo Daimao so long ago,

43
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,440
may yet appear again.

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,450
Let us pray to Kami, our god.

45
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,660
You can pray, but there is no Kami-<i>sama.</i>

46
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,290
So that's it, huh? Artificial Human Cell?

47
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,710
That is indeed something terrible.

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,680
You know, there are all sorts of
terrible things that happen around you,

49
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,640
one after another, huh?

50
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,800
Mm-hmm.

51
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,930
That's why I was thinking, why don't we
have another Namekian become Kami-<i>sama,</i>

52
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,640
and then get the Dragon Balls restored?

53
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,480
It sure would help me

54
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,150
just knowing which direction the
planet where the Namekians are is, though.

55
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,570
You got it. I'll give it a shot.

56
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,490
Let's see...

57
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,720
It sure would be nice if
we succeed in finding them.

58
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,390
Mister Popo, you know,

59
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,730
seems awfully lonesome ever
since Kami-<i>sama</i> has been gone.

60
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:44,730
I guess that's to be expected, though,
living all by himself in that temple.

61
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,320
Of course he would be! That's just what you'd–

62
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,280
Shut up!! Keep quiet!
I can't concentrate, you know!

63
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,000
A-E-I-O-U!

64
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,460
Geez, be serious, would you?

65
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,420
Sorry, sorry.

66
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,130
I found them, I found them!

67
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,720
This time for real. This direction.

68
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,430
Really? Thank you!

69
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,310
All right, this way, then?

70
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,850
Even far away, if I at least
know which direction to look in,

71
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,150
I might be able to latch on to their <i>ki...</i>

72
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,400
Incredible! Instantaneous Movement, huh?

73
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,740
When did you come to learn that technique?

74
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,160
Oh, I know! Instantaneous Movement
is the specialty move of the Yardratians!

75
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,700
You had the Yardratians teach it to you, huh?

76
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,330
That makes sense.

77
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,420
You know, that must be convenient, huh?

78
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,040
Be quiet, would you?!

79
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,130
Oh, don't mind me!

80
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,140
I did it! This is the <i>ki</i>!

81
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,720
Without a doubt, this is a Namekian <i>ki</i>!

82
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,850
Thank you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,820
W-What?

84
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,160
There are a whole bunch of Piccolos here!

85
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,410
G-Grand Elder-<i>sama</i>...!

86
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,960
W-Who are you?

87
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:37,720
Um, my name is Son Goku,
and I've come from Earth.

88
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,010
You're the Goku-<i>san</i> who fought
Freeza on Planet Namek, and saved us all.

89
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,480
Planet Namek blew up, though...

90
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,650
It seems that Earth is in
quite a terrible uproar, huh?

91
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:57,490
You know about how
Cell is running rampant?

92
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,530
We don't know any details,

93
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,620
but there is an evil <i>ki</i> that
spreads even here, to our planet.

94
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,870
Well, that saves me some explaining.

95
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,920
The truth is,

96
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,710
I'm here looking for someone
who would become our Kami-<i>sama.</i>

97
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,090
A Namekian, who will restore our Dragon Balls,

98
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,670
so we can bring back to life
the people that Cell has killed.

99
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,590
There's a guy named Piccolo,

100
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,310
who says he originally
came from Planet Namek.

101
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,730
Piccolo? Ah, you must
mean the child of Katattsu.

102
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,150
It sure would help us out if one of you

103
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,730
would come to Earth and be our Kami-<i>sama.</i>

104
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,150
Go to Earth?

105
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,740
Yeesh, Earth, huh?

106
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,320
I get you.

107
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,740
In that case, we have just the right person!

108
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,490
Really?

109
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,410
Hey, Dende!

110
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,460
Come over here.

111
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,460
R-Right!

112
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,510
This is Dende.

113
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,850
He is good friends with your son,
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, as well as Kuririn-<i>san.</i>

114
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,690
Ever since then, he has been longing for Earth.

115
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,320
He's always saying "I miss them,
I miss Gohan-<i>kun</i> and the others."

116
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,320
That's great! But unless you
can handle the Dragon Balls...

117
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,950
It's all right.

118
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,330
Despite how he may look,
Dende is a brilliant Dragon-type.

119
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,750
I'm sure he will become a fine Kami-<i>sama</i>!

120
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,290
Is that right? Gotcha.

121
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,290
Nice meeting you, Dende.

122
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,300
R-Right. That goes for me, too.

123
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,300
Well, let's leave right away.

124
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,310
Thanks. We'll take responsibility
for looking after Dende.

125
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,470
Farewell, everyone!

126
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,640
Take care!

127
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,650
Steady on, Dende!

128
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,650
Goku-<i>san</i>, we pray for Earth's peace.

129
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,480
Yeah, thank you.

130
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,950
Kaio-<i>sama</i>! It went great!

131
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,240
This is Earth's new Kami-<i>sama.</i>

132
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,370
Well then, see you later!

133
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,460
Hey! I just came from
the new Planet Namek!

134
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,040
D-Dende?!

135
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,630
This person new Kami-<i>sama</i>?

136
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,010
Yeah.

137
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,510
Y-You're sure that Dende
can serve as Kami-<i>sama</i>?

138
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,310
It'll be fine, I tell you!
Wait here for a minute.

139
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,770
I'm going to bring Kuririn and
Gohan here right away. All right, then...

140
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,070
People of the world, we
have wonderful news for you!

141
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,450
That ultra-gifted combat
sportsman, our hero Satan,

142
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,490
has decided to enter that
tournament of death, the Cell Games!

143
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,540
Here is our superhero, Satan!

144
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:04,300
Satan! Satan!

145
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,060
Satan! Satan! Satan!

146
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,640
Satan! Satan!

147
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,640
Who is that guy?

148
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,480
He's the world champion of combat sports.

149
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,320
Are you sure you'll be all right, Mister Satan?

150
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,660
Your opponent, Cell, is capable
of annihilating even whole armies.

151
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,160
That was nothing more than a trick.

152
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,660
He planted explosives there ahead of time.

153
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,250
I figured that out right away.

154
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,630
When compared to a combat sportsman,
it's almost as if he's an amateur!

155
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:43,920
I, Satan, will be sure to
crush this crazy sham artist!

156
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,380
Got that, people of earth?!

157
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,470
–Way to go!
–Satan!

158
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,060
Satan! Satan!

159
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,430
Good grief, there's no helping this idiot.

160
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,150
Goku-<i>sa</i>, where in the world did
you go, leavin' the rest of us behind?!

161
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,570
C-Chichi, just a minute!

162
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,490
Kuririn, Gohan, come with me, would you?

163
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,320
I brought back our new Kami-<i>sama</i>!

164
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,160
You know Dende, right? The Namekian?

165
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,410
Huh? Dende?

166
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,710
Gohan-<i>san</i>! Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

167
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,250
It's true! It's Dende!

168
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,320
It sure has been a long time!
It's great that you came, Dende!

169
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,490
Say, is it true you're going
to be Earth's Kami-<i>sama</i>?

170
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,070
Y-Yes.

171
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,490
Sure you are. Ever since
long ago, you've had promise.

172
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,660
Now we can see each other every day!

173
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,960
So then, Dende...

174
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,500
Are you truly able to handle the Dragon Balls?

175
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,510
It's all right!

176
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,300
That oldster Namekian said that
Dende was a brilliant Dragon-type.

177
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,720
Oldster?

178
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,310
H-He means the Grand Elder-<i>sama.</i>

179
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,850
R-Right, right.

180
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,150
The Grand Elder-<i>sama</i> vouched
for him, so there ain't no mistaking it.

181
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,150
Given a hundred days, I believe
I can have the Dragon Balls ready.

182
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,400
A hundred days?! Is that how long it takes?!

183
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,750
I know!

184
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,460
If you have the Dragon Balls
you used previously on Earth,

185
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,130
and a model of the dragon,

186
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,710
I can restore them right away!

187
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,130
Really?

188
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,010
The previous ones should have turned to stone,

189
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,470
and are scattered across the Earth's surface.

190
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,470
There is dragon model, made by Mister Popo.

191
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,810
That's great!

192
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,140
So, we've got it made, don't we?

193
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,310
All right!

194
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,150
So, how about it?

195
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,770
Will we be able to have three wishes granted,

196
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,320
like it was when we were on Planet Namek?

197
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,150
Yes!

198
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,530
Then, like before,

199
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,160
will it be possible to bring
many people back to life

200
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,320
and such with just one wish?

201
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,910
For example, "Please bring everyone
who was killed by Cell back to life."

202
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:27,130
I-It's not as though I can't do
something like that on my first casting,

203
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,710
but it does mean that there
can only be two wishes granted.

204
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,720
Huh? Is that all it takes,
and it will be all right?

205
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,300
Yes.

206
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,720
That will be fine.

207
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,720
Make it so they can do that.

208
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,310
Understood. Now then,
I'll need the model of the dragon...

209
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,150
Mister Popo, go bring us the model.

210
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,270
Right.

211
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,110
Mister Popo made this.

212
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,370
Such an interesting shape for a dragon!

213
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,160
Well, I'll give it a try now.

214
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,750
Dende, good luck!

215
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,330
Take it easy doing this!

216
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,500
Right!

217
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,730
There, I think the Dragon
Balls that were turned to stone

218
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,230
and scattered about have now been restored.

219
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,650
Really?

220
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,060
Outstanding!

221
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,490
<i>Well done! He certainly does</i>
<i>appear to possess a brilliant power.</i>

222
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,650
All right.

223
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,740
Well, I'll go borrow the Dragon
Radar from Bulma, and gather them up.

224
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,330
We'll leave you to it, Goku.

225
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,960
Yeah. Gohan, you don't
need to do any more training,

226
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,170
so until the Cell Games start,
you stay here and play with Dende.

227
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,170
B-But...

228
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:18,300
It's okay, it's okay, don't worry.

229
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,130
Ah, Goku-<i>san</i>, can I ask you something?

230
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:22,090
Huh? What is it?

231
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,850
Goku-<i>san</i>, your composure–by any chance,

232
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,310
is it because of some
weakness you've discovered in Cell?

233
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,310
That's it, right?

234
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,020
Nah, I doubt that guy has any weaknesses.

235
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,440
Well, I'm off.

236
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,540
Oh my, Son-<i>kun</i>!

237
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,500
Hey, this Artificial Human
is one incredible construction!

238
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,210
Doctor Gero may not
have been much of a person,

239
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,420
but he definitely was a genius.

240
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,510
Anyhow, Bulma, I'd like
to borrow your Dragon Radar.

241
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,140
I brought back a new
Kami-<i>sama</i> from Planet Namek.

242
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,350
Wow, nice going, huh?

243
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,310
Sure thing, it's in that drawer over there.

244
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,640
Thank you.

245
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,730
Oh, there it is!

246
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,570
Looks like it's working fine.

247
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:24,570
As long as I have this, I can tell
the exact location of the Dragon Balls.

248
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,160
Okay, I'll just take this with me.

249
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,740
Oh, just a second!

250
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,160
That's too bad,

251
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,330
I wanted to ask how Trunks was doing.

252
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,210
I guess it's okay...

253
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,680
Around here, maybe?

254
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,480
Oh, yeah! It's right nearby!

255
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,490
This place is a bit spread-out, huh?

256
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,460
Gohan-<i>san</i>, have you heard anything?

257
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:22,090
Goku-<i>san</i> has clearly stated
that Cell is stronger than he is,

258
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,130
and that he doesn't know of any weaknesses.

259
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,140
And yet, how is it that he's so cheery?

260
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,470
Father hasn't told me anything, either.

261
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,140
He just keeps telling
me to look forward to this.

262
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,140
Look forward to it?

263
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,980
But look, if he says to look forward to it,

264
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,320
then surely there must be
some chance of winning, right?

265
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,780
It could be just ordinary defiance.

266
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,410
It's definitely around here somewhere...

267
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,930
Hey, you! There are sandstorms
that blow through this area!

268
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,300
Watch yourself!

269
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,520
So that's it!

270
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,730
The Dragon Ball got buried deep
in the ground from the sandstorms!

271
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:23,270
Thank you!

272
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,070
All right...

273
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:50,260
What is it? What's happening?
Is it a whirlwind? Whoa...!

274
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,520
Here it is! It really has become a Dragon Ball!

275
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:10,780
<i>The Dragon Balls have been restored.</i>

276
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:22,120
<i>And so, time passed, with everyone</i>
<i>harboring their own speculations.</i>

277
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
That's two that I've found...

278
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,840
<i>Only a short time remains</i>
<i>before the Cell Games.</i>

279
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,730
This is boring.

280
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,770
Perhaps when I said
ten days, that was too long.

281
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,630
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

282
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,470
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

283
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,840
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

284
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,350
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

285
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,860
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

286
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,950
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

287
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

288
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

289
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

290
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,720
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

291
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,510
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

292
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,550
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

293
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:45,230
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

294
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,400
<i>So sorry.</i>

295
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,520
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

296
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,530
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

297
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,420
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

298
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:17,930
<i>Puzzle rings, huh? I ain't very good at these.</i>

299
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,930
<i>You can't just yank them apart, either.</i>

300
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:23,180
<i>Hey, Goku! Why are you casually</i>
<i>playing with those puzzle rings?</i>

301
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,930
<i>They're getting away</i>
<i>with all of the Dragon Balls!</i>

302
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,020
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

303
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,270
<i>"A Hard Problem for Goku!?</i>
<i>Take Back the Dragon Balls."</i>

304
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,570
<i>It really is hard to get all</i>
<i>the Dragon Balls together.</i>

305
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,570
"Next time"
"A Hard Problem for Goku!?
Take Back the Dragon Balls"
