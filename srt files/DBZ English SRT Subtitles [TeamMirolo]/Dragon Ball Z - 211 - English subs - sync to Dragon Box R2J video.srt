00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:24,575
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:30,165
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:35,915
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:41,545
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:48,805
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:54,565
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:57,145
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,185 --> 00:01:00,065
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,105 --> 00:01:02,905
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:02,945 --> 00:01:05,445
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,485 --> 00:01:08,455
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,495 --> 00:01:11,455
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:14,125
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:20,005
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,885
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,465
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,505 --> 00:01:28,475
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,515 --> 00:01:30,845
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:34,055
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,895
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:39,695
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:45,985
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:59,045
<i>The long-awaited Tenkaichi</i>
<i>Tournament has begun.</i>

24
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:04,125
<i>The Dragon Warriors easily made</i>
<i>their way through the preliminaries.</i>

25
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:18,225
<i>And, in the Junior Division,</i>
<i>Trunks eventually took the stage.</i>

26
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:32,405
Bring it on, you little turd! Come on!

27
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:38,415
You talk too much. I don't
need you to tell me what to do.

28
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:54,555
Hmph. Maybe I got a little too serious there.

29
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,395
Guess I'm still a kid, too.

30
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:59,565
He's unconscious!

31
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:02,435
Trunks-<i>kun</i> wins!

32
00:03:04,025 --> 00:03:07,235
<i>Trunks easily wins and moves on.</i>

33
00:03:07,275 --> 00:03:10,775
<i>Next is Goten's turn.</i>

34
00:03:17,205 --> 00:03:23,915
<i>"It's My Turn!</i>
<i>Goten's Anxious First Fight."</i>

35
00:03:51,735 --> 00:03:56,535
<i>The battle amongst the youngsters</i>
<i>showing off their skills continues.</i>

36
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:10,385
So then, let's continue!
We have come to the 16th round.

37
00:04:10,425 --> 00:04:16,055
Ikose-<i>kun</i>, age 14, versus Son Goten-<i>kun</i>, age 7.

38
00:04:16,095 --> 00:04:26,065
"Martial"

39
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:55,715
This little kid?

40
00:05:03,105 --> 00:05:06,525
Goten's making his entrance.

41
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:10,565
Can't wait to see what kind of match he has.

42
00:05:13,155 --> 00:05:19,075
Ikose-<i>chan</i>, don't drop your
guard like your brother did!

43
00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:26,875
Goten-<i>chan</i>! Be sure you go rough on him!

44
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:29,085
Another brat from the vulgar brigade?

45
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:32,675
To think another one of you
against my genteel, other son.

46
00:05:32,715 --> 00:05:34,675
Intolerable! Intolerable, I say!

47
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:36,925
Oh, my! Here I was thinking,

48
00:05:36,965 --> 00:05:39,265
there's another idiot-faced
hillbilly making an appearance,

49
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,095
and it turns out to be his brother?

50
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:42,765
Indeed!

51
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:45,395
There isn't going to be
a second miracle here today!

52
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:49,605
I hope your little brat meets a horrible fate!

53
00:05:55,115 --> 00:05:59,445
Wow! So many people here to watch!

54
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:07,875
He's overcome by how many
spectators are watching him.

55
00:06:13,675 --> 00:06:19,135
Hmm? That face... "Son Goten"...

56
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:48,285
I-I won, man!

57
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:55,005
I see. It's Son Goku's son!

58
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:58,175
Unmistakable! He's identical
to him when he was little.

59
00:06:58,215 --> 00:07:01,595
Now then, begin the match!

60
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:11,395
Hang in there, Goten! Just take it easy!

61
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:15,145
Ikose-<i>chan</i>, boom boom,
knock him down! Boom boom!

62
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:29,625
Sounds like Goten-<i>kun</i>'s match has started!

63
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:32,505
Yeah, so it seems.

64
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:36,125
If we don't finish up our preliminary
soon, we won't be able to see him.

65
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:41,055
Ready yet?

66
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:45,555
Sorry, the new Punch
Machine still needs tuning...

67
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:56,695
Hey, kid! Your friend's match is beginning!

68
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,615
Aren't you going to watch?

69
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:02,615
I don't have to watch to know what will happen.

70
00:08:02,655 --> 00:08:03,945
Oh?

71
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:07,615
Hey, let's go watch!

72
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:39,065
A little kid like you
shouldn't have come out here!

73
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:42,865
Take this! Assassin Punch!

74
00:08:49,995 --> 00:08:54,665
Hey, do it for real. As hard as you can.

75
00:08:57,585 --> 00:09:00,795
So, seems you are somewhat capable.

76
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:06,635
Ikose-<i>chan</i> is really into it at last!

77
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:11,555
But how many seconds will that hillbilly kid last?

78
00:09:11,595 --> 00:09:13,975
Ikose-<i>chan</i>! Win! Puh-leeze!

79
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:17,685
Smash that little brat for your Mama's sake!

80
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:25,615
That's all, huh?

81
00:09:25,655 --> 00:09:27,365
Fair enough.

82
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:40,175
Incredible! He knocked him out in one punch!

83
00:09:40,215 --> 00:09:42,585
He did it! He did it!

84
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,595
Of course he did.

85
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:48,925
H-Hey! Ikose-<i>kun</i>! Ikose-<i>kun</i>!

86
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:53,305
He's unconscious... Son Goten-<i>kun</i> wins!

87
00:10:08,445 --> 00:10:10,945
I won't allow this any longer!

88
00:10:16,585 --> 00:10:19,205
There, things've quieted down now.

89
00:10:20,005 --> 00:10:24,215
Awesome! Your friend beat him with one punch!

90
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:28,385
Didn't I say? I knew what
would happen without watching.

91
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:29,965
Y-Yeah.

92
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:37,895
Hey, looks like the seven-year-old kid won!

93
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:41,985
Sounds like Goten-<i>kun</i> won!

94
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:44,355
That's amazing, right, against a 14-year-old?

95
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,025
Yeah.

96
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:48,405
<i>It's only natural.</i>

97
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,195
What, aren't you happy?

98
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:54,365
Eh? Sure I'm happy. Yeah, he won!

99
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:57,825
<i>The matches continued...</i>

100
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:15,345
Goten-<i>kun</i> wins!

101
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:18,095
He did it! He did it!

102
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:43,795
Now!

103
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:58,765
Trunks-<i>kun</i> wins!

104
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,685
He did it!

105
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:09,365
<i>Goten and Trunks quickly</i>
<i>advance, until as expected,</i>

106
00:12:09,405 --> 00:12:14,405
<i>they face each other in the final round.</i>

107
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:26,505
And so, it's nearly time for the final round!

108
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,425
Our contestants for the final are...

109
00:12:28,465 --> 00:12:32,675
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, age 8, and Goten-<i>kun</i>, age 7.

110
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:49,405
This fight is mine!

111
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,405
You expect me to lose?

112
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:17,175
And so, it's nearly time for
the Junior Division final round!

113
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:22,975
Will the victor be Trunks-<i>kun</i>?
Or will it be Son Goten-<i>kun</i>?

114
00:13:25,015 --> 00:13:26,775
Good luck, Trunks!

115
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:31,655
Goten-<i>chan</i>! Win and get
us a big wad of prize money!

116
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:35,235
Don't either one of ya lose, now!

117
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:38,325
Finally, we'll get to see an entertaining match!

118
00:13:38,365 --> 00:13:39,825
Yeah.

119
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:48,205
Both contestants have fought their
way here with overpowering strength!

120
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:52,835
And what's more, both of them are good friends!

121
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:58,255
The final round is about to begin!

122
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:02,725
Um, is it ready? We're in a hurry here!

123
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:05,725
Oh, we've just now got it working!

124
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:08,565
Really? Well then, if I may...

125
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:10,735
No taking cuts!

126
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:13,615
–Wait your turn!
–Yeah!

127
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:14,775
Uh, but I...

128
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:17,615
No way! Return to your place in line!

129
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:18,785
Uh, now, hold on...

130
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:21,785
We're in a hurry!

131
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:25,205
No, ma'am. It's the rules.

132
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:27,535
The match is going to be over!

133
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:36,595
Hang tough, little guy!

134
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:38,175
Give us a good fight!

135
00:14:38,215 --> 00:14:41,215
Fight! Fight!

136
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:53,525
Mister Satan! Mister Satan!

137
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:57,735
Oh, were you resting?

138
00:14:57,775 --> 00:15:00,155
N-No, no.

139
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:03,455
I was unifying myself mentally before the match.

140
00:15:03,495 --> 00:15:06,585
One of the harder things to do,
once you become the champion,

141
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,455
is to keep yourself in
tip-top condition at all times,

142
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:10,745
as is expected of you during the match!

143
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:16,845
The Junior Division final
is about to get underway,

144
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:21,215
and there are two very
strong children competing.

145
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:24,015
Would the champion care to watch the match?

146
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:27,555
I think it will be a very entertaining bout.

147
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:30,725
Very well, what else can I do?
I'll watch their match for a bit.

148
00:15:30,765 --> 00:15:36,985
After all, I have to take on
whichever one of these youngsters wins.

149
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:40,235
We apologize for the delay.

150
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:47,115
We would now like to present the
Tenkaichi Tournament Junior Division Final!

151
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:52,255
I'm telling you now,

152
00:15:52,295 --> 00:15:55,925
I won't be pulling any punches, Goten.

153
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:59,085
Yeah, me neither!

154
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:02,515
Those two?

155
00:16:02,555 --> 00:16:05,935
Yes, that's correct. They say they're 7 and 8.

156
00:16:05,975 --> 00:16:09,725
Those kids did well to get this far.

157
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:20,865
That kid–I have this feeling like
we've met, but we haven't met...

158
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,495
Hmm, I can't quite place it.

159
00:16:37,295 --> 00:16:39,255
Goten!

160
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:41,925
Trunks!

161
00:16:47,595 --> 00:16:50,895
Keep your composure, Trunks! Goten!

162
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:31,595
Oh, incredible!

163
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,935
They've started!

164
00:17:35,975 --> 00:17:37,605
Wait, Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

165
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:45,655
Whew, sorry to keep you waiting!
We finally finished our preliminary!

166
00:17:45,695 --> 00:17:47,655
You're awful late.

167
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:52,915
We thought that maybe
you two were off on a date!

168
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:56,085
That's not true! It wasn't like that!

169
00:17:56,125 --> 00:17:58,085
It's okay, it's okay!

170
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,125
Thank goodness you made
it in time. This is a good part.

171
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:10,055
Nice going, both of you!

172
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:35,575
That's cold!

173
00:18:46,965 --> 00:18:50,925
That's the way! Goten! Trunks!

174
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:08,025
Goten-<i>chan</i>!

175
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:22,085
Goten! Go!

176
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:27,085
–Trunks! What are you doing?!
–Hang in there!

177
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:34,475
All right! All right! Goten-<i>chan</i>!

178
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:37,185
Trunks!

179
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:29,945
Go! Go! Trunks!

180
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:31,815
Goten!

181
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:25,665
W-What is the story with them?

182
00:21:26,915 --> 00:21:31,425
This is a fight between an
eight-year-old and a seven-year-old?

183
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:36,975
Lil' Trunks and Goten are both
pretty good at this, ain't they?

184
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:38,845
Aren't they, though?

185
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:42,435
Way to go, way to go, Trunks, Goten!

186
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:48,855
A-Awesome!

187
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:09,005
<i>The fight between the</i>
<i>promising Trunks and Goten...</i>

188
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:16,135
<i>Which will be the one decorated as victor of</i>

189
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:20,635
<i>the Tenkaichi Tournament Junior Division?</i>

190
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:38,865
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

191
00:22:40,575 --> 00:22:45,415
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

192

<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

193
00:22:56,045 --> 00:23:02,095
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

194
00:23:02,135 --> 00:23:09,105
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

195
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:14,485
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

196
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:18,365
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

197
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:27,415
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

198
00:23:27,455 --> 00:23:28,955
<i>Even now?</i>

199
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:36,585
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

200
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:42,015
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

201
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:48,475
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

202
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:58,525
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

203
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:15,925
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

204
00:24:15,965 --> 00:24:19,175
<i>Goten, Trunks, not bad, both of you!</i>

205
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:21,965
<i>Just what you'd expect from Saiyan kids.</i>

206
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:25,475
<i>Goten, I think it's about time</i>
<i>to end this. Brace yourself.</i>

207
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:27,645
<i>I am going to be victorious.</i>

208
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,435
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

209

<i>"Happiness Times A Million!</i>
<i>The Junior Champion is Decided!!"</i>

210
00:24:32,765 --> 00:24:37,605
<i>Aw, I told you both, don't turn Super Saiyan!</i>

211
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:39,605
