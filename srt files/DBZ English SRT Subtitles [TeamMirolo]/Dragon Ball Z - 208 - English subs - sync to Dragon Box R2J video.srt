<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,160
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,920
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,550
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,810
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,570
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:57,150
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,070
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,910
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,490
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,500
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,500
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,510
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,520
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,850
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,060
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,900
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,690

23
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,330
<i>The Tenkaichi Tournament</i>
<i>is drawing ever closer.</i>

24
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:59,210
<i>Goten and Videl were being trained</i>
<i>how to perform Bukujutsu by Gohan.</i>

25
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,200
That was incredible, wasn't it?

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,540
It's amazing that you've gotten so
you're able to float in just one day!

27
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,490
You don't say...

28
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,630
<i>Elsewhere, Vegeta and Trunks continued</i>
<i>their training in the heavy gravity room.</i>

29
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,180
I-It's too hard like this, all right.
I think I'll turn Super Saiyan!

30
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,400
Y-You've got to be kidding me.

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,780
He turned into a Super Saiyan,
the warrior of legend, that easily...?

32
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,280
<i>"Welcome Back, Goku!</i>
<i>The Entire Z Team Assembles!!"</i>

33
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,920
Look! I've gotten so I can float pretty well!

34
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,010
Great, great! You've got it down perfectly!

35
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,550
At this rate, I doubt there's
anything else I can teach you.

36
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Yay! Yahoo!

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,280
Say, how many days do you think it
will take before I can fly like that?

38
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,660
W-Well, good question. I don't know...

39
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,500
I intend to keep coming here until then.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,670
J-Just a minute.

41
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,260
Big Brother, watch me, watch me! See?

42
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,520
Goten, don't fly any
faster when Videl-<i>san</i> is here!

43
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,520
Why not?

44
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,770
Doesn't matter why not, okay?

45
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,530
What was that?

46
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,570
Nothing, just a little advice.

47
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,340
Time for a short break.

48
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,510
Listen, don't let my papa know that
you've been giving me training in flying.

49
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,680
I plan on surprising him by showing it to
him for the first time during the matches.

50
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,680
Is that right? That might be best, huh?

51
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,520
Besides, if Papa found out that
I was going over to a boy's house,

52
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,520
it would be awful!

53
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,520
He's terribly protective about me.

54
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,730
Listen to me, Videl,

55
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,400
you are not allowed to see any boys
unless they are stronger than your papa.

56
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:17,370
And yet there aren't any
such boys in the whole world.

57
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,540
Papa is the world champion, after all.

58
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,630
You know, Gohan-<i>kun,</i>
you do pretty well yourself,

59
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,500
but even so, I wonder if
you'd be any match for Papa.

60
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,550
S-Say, do you often engage in
practice matches with your father?

61
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,550
Practice matches?

62
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,930
There's no reason to do that,
is there? He's the champion!

63
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,770
Lately, he hasn't been overseeing my training,

64
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,940
so I've been doing it all on my own.

65
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,150
<i>I knew it! Videl-san hasn't yet realized</i>

66
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,650
<i>that she has already become</i>
<i>far stronger than Mister Satan.</i>

67
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:58,580
S-Say, if your father were to lose to someone,

68
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,500
that would be a pretty big shock, wouldn't it?

69
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,920
No it wouldn't. Papa is a little too full of himself.

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,340
Sure, Mama has died and is no longer around,

71
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,510
but he uses his fame as champion to
dally around with all sorts of women!

72
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:16,350
It would do him a little good to lose once.

73
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,350
<i>Okay, okay! Even if I defeat Mister Satan,</i>

74
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,930
<i>Videl-san won't be hurt by it!</i>

75
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,730
Now then, I guess we should keep going.

76
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,570
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, come to think of it,
who did you learn Bukujustu from?

77
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:39,240
Oh, um, it was from a friend
of mine, and my late father.

78
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,500
So I bet your father must
have been fairly strong, right?

79
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,710
Mm-hmm, he was awfully strong.

80
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,800
You know what? Father is going
to be coming back for one day,

81
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,840
so he can enter the Tenkaichi Tournament.

82
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,680
Coming back? How do
you mean? He's dead, isn't he?

83
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,600
Y-You dummy, Goten! I told you not
to say anything about that, didn't I?!

84
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Ah, I get it.

85
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,360
I'll bet your father walked out
on you a long time ago, right?

86
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,570
But he secretly contacted you to tell
you he would be entering the tournament.

87
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,610
Isn't that right?

88
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:24,910
Both of us have had a hard
time of it with our fathers.

89
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,330
M-Mm-hmm...

90
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,920
Well, never mind about them! Training, training!

91
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,590
Hey! Where's Videl? What happened to Videl?

92
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,640
She hasn't come home yet.

93
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,600
What is she doing, staying
out late every night like this?

94
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,730
<i>And so, several days later...</i>

95
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,110
Watch out, watch out!

96
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,370
<i>Videl-san is something else, all right.</i>

97
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,170
<i>She's gotten so she can fly</i>
<i>pretty freely in just ten days.</i>

98
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:18,380
Really, you're doing great.
There's nothing more I can teach you.

99
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,220
Thank you, Gohan-<i>kun.</i>
Now I can devote myself to training

100
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,930
for the Tenkaichi Tournament
without any worries.

101
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,390
Mm-hmm, me too.

102
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,560
Well, I have to get home.

103
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,940
I know! I could just fly home like this, huh?

104
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,400
Mm-hmm.

105
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,780
Okay, I'll see you at the tournament. Good-bye!

106
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,820
–Good-bye!
–Good-bye!

107
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,410
Sissy finally went home, huh?

108
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,790
Yeah.

109
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,120
Goten, now we can train!

110
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,670
We'll have to make up for all the time we lost!

111
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,250
Uh-huh!

112
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,670
Come on, Goten!

113
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,260
<i>The Tenkaichi Tournament draws ever nearer.</i>

114
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,940
<i>Everyone was putting their final</i>
<i>efforts into the last of their training.</i>

115
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,690
<i>Vegeta...</i>

116
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:22,650
9,993... 9,994... 9,995... 9,996...

117
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,320
<i>Piccolo...</i>

118
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,200
<i>Kuririn...</i>

119
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,620
<i>Once you get married,</i>
<i>then the pressure is really on.</i>

120
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,680
Videl-<i>san</i> has incredible drive, huh?

121
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,890
S-She's a lot stronger than before...

122
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,860
Put a new one up, would you?

123
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,740
S-Sure...

124
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,620
Papa...?

125
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,210
Oh, Videl...

126
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,580
Are you sure you shouldn't be training?

127
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,380
There's no need for that.
There's no doubt that Papa will win.

128
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,420
I'll end up on top again!

129
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,600
It's no use... I just can't
keep up with you, Big Brother...

130
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,180
That's only because I've been
training a lot longer than you, Goten.

131
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,360
But Goten, you're doing pretty well yourself.

132
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,530
I wonder if Father is really
coming to the tournament.

133
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,950
Goten, this will be the first time
you've ever met Father, won't it?

134
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,530
You must be looking forward to it.

135
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,490
Mm-hmm.

136
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,170
Goku–Where is Goku?

137
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,340
It's almost time for the
tournament to begin on Earth.

138
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:25,380
Goku is over there.

139
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,970
Right now, he has finished all of his training,

140
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,430
and is calming his mind.

141
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,350
Say, do you suppose
Son-<i>kun</i> will really be coming?

142
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,360
He's coming, that's for sure.

143
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,610
Wow, how many years has it
been since we've seen Goku?

144
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,070
I'm sure looking forward to this.

145
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,490
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, Father might not
recognize you with that hairstyle.

146
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,030
You're probably right.

147
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,170
It really has been a powerful long time!

148
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,130
I'm so glad everyone's lookin' so well!

149
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,800
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, aren't you enterin'?

150
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,550
There's no way I could enter.

151
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,670
Even if I did, I would just embarrass myself.

152
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,680
By the way, Vegeta-<i>san</i> and this
goes for you too, Goten and Trunks-<i>kun,</i>

153
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,810
would you mind if we didn't turn
Super Saiyan during the tournament?

154
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,980
Why not?

155
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:11,820
Don't you know? You were already
shown on TV during the fight with Cell,

156
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,370
and people might wonder
where they've ever seen you before.

157
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,080
Now, try turning Super Saiyan in front of them.

158
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,830
They'll say "Ah! It's that group from back then!"

159
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,500
Yeah, and when that happens,
it's sure to become bothersome,

160
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,920
what with the TV and everything.

161
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,760
Hmph, I could just blow those people away.

162
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,760
No, you can't very well do that.

163
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,520
Well, all right. As long as
nobody turns Super Saiyan,

164
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,350
the conditions are the same.
It won't affect my superiority.

165
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,940
That's okay with us, too.

166
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,360
Uh-huh.

167
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,940
Terrific. Thanks, everyone.

168
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,570
That will help me out, too.

169
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,820
That sort of thing should be against the rules.

170
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,710
There it is, there it is!

171
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,170
That's the island with the
Tenkaichi Tournament grounds!

172
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,930
Okay, it's just about time.

173
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,640
Now then, I'd better get ready.

174
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,770
Say, Gohan, are you going to fight in that getup?

175
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,780
Yes. It would be bad if people
at my school found out who I was.

176
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,940
Pretty nice, right?

177
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,990
Y-Yeah...

178
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,260
Hey, there sure are a lot people here.

179
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,760
You're right. What a hassle.

180
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,310
I wonder if Goku is here already.

181
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,940
–What's up?
–It's Mister Satan!

182
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,110
Mister Satan just arrived!

183
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,820
–Mister Satan, huh?
–I'm getting his autograph!

184
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,940
The hero who saved the world has arrived.

185
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,360
That guy sure is popular, huh?

186
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,370
Nobody knows what really happened, after all.

187
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:25,030
<i>Videl-san's father, huh?</i>

188
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,800
Satan! Satan! Satan!

189
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,560
Satan fans of the world,
sorry to keep you waiting!

190
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,770
Mister Satan, what do you think of
your chances for winning this tournament?

191
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,320
Well, to be honest, I am 120%
certain that I will be victorious!

192
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,370
I understand your daughter is
going to compete this time as well.

193
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,830
Have you cut your hair as a
means of expressing yourself?

194
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,040
How annoying. Leave me alone.

195
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,920
It's all mine, all mine!

196
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,920
That guy is the same as ever.

197
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,340
Pay no mind, pay no mind.

198
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,090
Anyhow, I wonder if Father is here yet.

199
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:24,140
I don't see him anywhere.

200
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,350
Big Brother, there's Piccolo-<i>san.</i>

201
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,310
Oh, you're right.

202
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,770
Piccolo-<i>san...</i>

203
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:38,070
Have you seen Father?

204
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,280
Gohan... No, not yet.

205
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,950
Are you planning to enter wearing that outfit?

206
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,240
Of course.

207
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,380
I wonder what could be keepin' Goku-<i>sa.</i>

208
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,300
Could he already have gone
to the contestants' waitin' area?

209
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,260
All right, I'll go see.

210
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,460
Yeah, me too.

211
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,930
Yoo-hoo!

212
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,770
Father!

213
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:09,930
Son!

214
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,770
H-Hey!

215
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,100
You've all changed quite a bit, huh?

216
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,610
Even so... how have you been?

217
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,620
G-Goku-<i>sa</i>...!

218
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,000
We're glad you're back!

219
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,460
Son-<i>kun...</i>

220
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,810
G-Goku!

221
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,780
–Goku!
–Father!

222
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,990
Goku-<i>sa</i>! I've been waitin' for you!

223
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,490
I've missed you, too.

224
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,790
Goten, it's your father.

225
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,380
Huh?! And here I thought
he looked just like me!

226
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,380
Is that really my son?

227
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,880
Father...?

228
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,820
Father!

229
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,870
You sure are spirited!
You look strong, just like me!

230
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,550
Goku...

231
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,680
I'll remind you one more time,
you've only got 24 hours. Got it?

232
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,690
Yeah, understood.

233
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,690
See you later.

234
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,270
Thank you, O-Baba!

235
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:26,190
Hey, we have to hurry and take
care of the tournament registration,

236
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,280
or we'll miss the deadline.

237
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,120
Huh? G-Great–

238
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,700
Great Saiyaman.

239
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,290
Great Saiyaman?

240
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,120
That's right.

241
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,710
What's that about?

242
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,420
The name and the outfit are awfully cool, right?

243
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,590
S-Sure they are!

244
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,590
Okay, next.

245
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,060
Let's see, you'll be
in the Junior Division.

246
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,230
Huh?! Junior Division?!

247
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:03,110
Children up to 15 years
old are in the Junior Division.

248
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,110
Hey, Goten, they say that if
you're 15 years old or younger,

249
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,440
they won't let you fight with the adults.

250
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,740
Oh dear, is that the rule now?
That's pretty convoluted.

251
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,750
I don't care! Let us fight with the adults!

252
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,290
No way, that's against
the rules. Absolutely no way.

253
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,370
Aw, this won't be any fun.

254
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:31,010
Contestants, please hurry
and report to the waiting area!

255
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:39,680
Good luck, Goku-<i>sa</i>, Gohan, Goten!
Earn us a big wad of prize money!

256
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,270
Right.

257
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:44,810
Okay then, it's been
a long time since I got wild.

258
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,690
<i>I've got to see how much</i>
<i>stronger Father has become.</i>

259
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,950
I won't be holding back, okay?

260
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,620
Me neither!

261
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,820
Dad's going to go give it
his best, now, so wait for me.

262
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,330
We're off!

263
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,800
You guys, don't get too carried away!

264
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,710
Good luck!

265
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,760
<i>At last, Son Goku has</i>
<i>returned from the Next World.</i>

266
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,810
<i>The Dragon Team has reassembled,</i>

267

274
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,370

275

282

285
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,940
