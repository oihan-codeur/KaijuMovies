00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:36,020

<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>who have concealed themselves in</i>
<i>Kami's palace, has finally commenced.</i>

25
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,450
Okay, begin, Majin Boo!

26
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,510
Okay!

27
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,300
You turn into hard candy!

28
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,120
All the people on this
planet will end up like this!

29
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,550
<i>"Gohan Revived –</i>
<i>Kaioshin's Secret Weapon!?"</i>

30
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,940
If those three don't come forward,
everyone is going to be eaten up!

31
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:39,670
And now, there's no reason to have this
city here with no people left in it, right?

32
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,800
I have no choice but to sweep it up
for you! Okay, Majin Boo, make it clean!

33
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,100
Not too hard, though, or the
whole Earth will be wiped out!

34
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,470
Okay! Okay!

35
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,150
That guy's getting cocky now!

36
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,110
My, my, my, looks like
he messed it up instead!

37
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,690
I'll say it one more time.

38
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,110
Him,

39
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,280
and him,

40
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,820
and him.

41
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,670
Tell me where they are,

42
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,930
unless you'd rather be turned
into candy and eaten by Majin Boo!

43
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,070
Let's see, it will take about five days
to exterminate every Earthling.

44
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,280
And so, I think it would
be best if you tell me soon.

45
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,450
Piccolo, Shen Long will do anything for us.

46
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,250
Right, right! I almost
forgot something important!

47
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,720
How are you supposed to contact me?

48
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,350
Call to me inside your head.

49
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:43,270
You just have to think out a little bit,
and then you can talk to me.

50
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,480
Of course, contact from those
people themselves is most welcome!

51
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm sure those three were...

52
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,910
Hey! If he doesn't find them fast,

53
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,030
we're all going to be
turned to candy and eaten!

54
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,200
Doesn't anyone know them?!

55
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,420
I don't know who you are,
but where are you hiding?!

56
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,290
Come out now!

57
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,090
We're going to be turned into
candy and eaten because of you!

58
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:17,300
If I am turned into
candy here and eaten now,

59
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,100
then all the studying I've done for
my entrance exams will have meant...

60
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,220
...that I did it all for nothing, you stupid jerks!!

61
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,640
We were to have our wedding tomorrow.

62
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,230
We've done everything we
could to save up for our marriage.

63
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,650
What have you done with my life?!

64
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,980
It isn't my fault!!

65
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,080
Oh? Looks like I'm being contacted right away!

66
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Um, I am the one who was in charge of the
Tenkaichi Tournament that was held today.

67
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,460
Mm hmm, and...?

68
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,630
Those three were entered
into today's tournament.

69
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:00,470
Oh? So, who are they?

70
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:10,440
Um, his name is Ma Junior, and
the children are... Trunks and Goten.

71
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,900
Their names don't matter,
I want you to tell me where they live!

72
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,030
Uh, n-no, I do not have their addresses...

73
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,070
Just names? Those don't mean anything!

74
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,670
His head...!

75
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,470
I must turn down trivial
information and prank calls.

76
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,100
You don't want to die
like he did just now, right?

77
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:46,010
How awful!

78
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,940
I'm quite busy.

79
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:01,110
After all, I have to go all over now and
wipe out the people and cities of Earth!

80
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,610
Majin Boo, let's go!

81
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,580
Well, next might be your location!

82
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,420
And let me say now,
that there's no use in hiding.

83
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:18,630
After five days, I plan on blowing
every last bit of the Earth to bits!

84
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,720
Well, I'll be waiting for that information!

85
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,270
D-Damn... That bastard!

86
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,640
What kind of guys are these?

87
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,440
Popo head hurts.

88
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,610
Th-They... are the ones who
killed Vegeta and Gohan-<i>kun</i>, right?

89
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,610
Yeah. Some awful guys
sure have come around.

90
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,620
In five days, they really could
blow the Earth to smithereens.

91
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:53,370
There's no reason to watch as those
people are sacrificed. I'm going out.

92
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,590
What sort of foolishness
are you saying, Piccolo?!

93
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:03,380
If you die, who will there be to teach
Fusion to Trunks and Goten in place of me?!

94
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,180
If they can't perform Fusion,
Majin Boo cannot be beaten!

95
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,020
In any event, they are going
to destroy Earth. That's for sure!

96
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,820
Until they master Fusion,

97
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,570
a considerable number of people
will become casualties of Majin Boo.

98
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,870
We'll just have to endure it–it
was you that said so, ain't it?

99
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,880
Everyone who's dead, and everything
on the ground that's been destroyed

100
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,040
can be brought back with the Dragon Balls.

101
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,050
So don't worry about it!

102
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,050
What he says is right!

103
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,340
That's right!

104
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,340
Now is the time for patience, right?

105
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,640
Understood...

106
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,540
Where is this?

107
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,010
I don't know this place!

108
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,430
Hey, Goten!

109
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:36,430
Wake up! Hey, Goten, I say!

110
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,570
Yeesh, can't do anything with you!

111
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,530
I know! Goten! Time to eat!

112
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,990
Food?!

113
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,990
Where? Where? Where? Where's the food?!

114
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:59,420
Ow, ow, ow! Of all the...!
You are such a glutton!

115
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,460
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, where is this?

116
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,340
I don't know! This is my first time!

117
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,050
This is the first time for me too. Wow!

118
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,050
What an expensive-looking dish!

119
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,010
Never mind that, what are we doing here?

120
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,480
W-Where's Papa?!

121
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,600
That's right! We were...

122
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,610
And then Papa...

123
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,730
Yeah.

124
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,610
Take care, Trunks.

125
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,620
T-Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

126
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:41,620
Why?! Why did you hit
Trunks-<i>kun</i>! That's awful!

127
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,040
How come?!

128
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,260
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, where's Uncle?

129
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,770
Goten, let's figure out where this is!

130
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,720
What is this place?

131
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,100
There's nothing here, huh?

132
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,650
Where those two go?

133
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,420
Okay, Kibit, restore Gohan-<i>san</i>'s power.

134
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,010
Right.

135
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,820
H-Huh?

136
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,740
Kaioshin-<i>sama...</i>

137
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,000
Where is this...?

138
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,920
The Kaioshin Realm, or if you like, my world.

139
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,800
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>'s...?

140
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,720
S-So that's it. I've died after all, haven't I?

141
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,600
Huh? I don't have a halo like Dad does...

142
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,640
No, you're okay. It was
close, but you are alive.

143
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,770
Then, why am I in a place like this?

144
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,200
What do you mean by calling the
Kaioshin Realm "a place like this?!"

145
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,490
From the beginning, the
Kaioshin Realm was a holy place,

146
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,330
where not even Kami or Kaio
could come, let alone humans.

147
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:27,960
Surely, you're supposed to be dead!
Can you come back to life?

148
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,760
N-No, I cannot. I don't understand
myself, but for some reason,

149
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,010
I have come back to life.
A strange thing has happened.

150
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,850
Ah, really? Um, why
have you brought me here?

151
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,430
I was wanting to ask that as well!

152
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,690
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, why have you
brought a human to this sacred place?

153
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,190
We're going to use the
Z-Sword to defeat Majin Boo!

154
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:59,320
Knowing Gohan-<i>san</i>, he's
sure to be able to use that blade.

155
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,330
Th-The Z-Sword?!

156
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:06,750
A-Are you in your right mind, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?

157
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,830
There is no way any human
should be able to use the Z-Sword!

158
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,750
Not that legendary blade,

159
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,970
which so many Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> before
could do nothing with, let alone myself!

160
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:25,970
Kibit, you were dead, so you do not know
of Gohan-<i>san</i>'s unbelievable, amazing power.

161
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,980
Z-Sword?

162
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,810
B-B-But no matter how strong he is...

163
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,400
In any case, let us go try it.
Son Gohan-<i>san</i>, come with us.

164
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,750
Entrusting the Z-Sword to a human...
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, what in the world...?!

165
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,340
Yummy, huh Trunks-<i>kun</i>?

166
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,180
Say, where do you think this is?

167
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,930
Where did Uncle and
Piccolo-<i>san</i> and the others go?

168
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,390
Goten! Talking should not
be done in the middle of a meal!

169
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,350
You've got a few bad manners.

170
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:13,770
No matter what happens, you
should be quiet during meals.

171
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,770
Sorry, Trunks-<i>kun.</i>

172
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:16,900
Just so you know.

173
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,740
Found you!

174
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,910
Plenty appetite! No worries!

175
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,910
W-What are you doing?!

176
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,080
We were wrong to eat without
asking first, but there's so much here,

177
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,200
you won't miss a little bit, stingy!

178
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:37,800
Damn! Why, you son of a... Hey, Goten!

179
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,010
Do something here! This is no
time to be just casually eating!

180
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,800
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, it's bad manners
to speak in such a loud voice.

181
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,970
You idiot!

182
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:51,730
You're the one who said meals
should be spent quietly, Trunks-<i>kun.</i>

183
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,600
I was a fool for counting on you!

184
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,860
Incredible power, greater
than Son Goku when child!

185
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,700
Goten, let's get out of here!

186
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,860
Yeah!

187
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,870
Wait!

188
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,870
–Get him!
–Yeah!

189
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,300
Goten, get out of here now!

190
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:19,920
Yeah!

191
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,360
Nice going, Goten!

192
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,980
Both of you, stay there!

193
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,740
Father!

194
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,910
Uncle...

195
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,080
Goku, both full of spirit.

196
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,250
Yeah, we'll have to have
them work hard for us.

197
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,460
These children could be awesome if do Fusion.

198
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:08,800
This sure is a nice place here.
It's a lot like the place where I live.

199
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,560
Those clothes are unworthy of this holy region.

200
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,830
It suits you well, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

201
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:36,910
Y-You think so?

202
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,670
Over there, Gohan-<i>san.</i>

203
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,480
This blade is the Z-Sword.

204
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,870
Please pull it out.

205
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:17,250
As far as I know, there has not been
anyone capable of pulling this blade out.

206
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,460
Pull it out?

207
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,800
Seems like there was something
like this in ancient folklore...

208
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:35,310
Y-You're lying! Papa beaten by that guy?!

209
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,930
It's a lie! A lie! A lie!

210
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:42,730
Big Brother is dead!

211
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:47,320
Stop crying! There ain't any time for it!

212
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,990
If you don't like it, then hurry
and learn this new technique

213
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,990
and avenge them! Got it?!

214
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,000
I know it seems harsh,

215
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,960
but Babidi might find out
about this place sometime.

216
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,420
We start training immediately!

217
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,260
Are you using the Room of Spirit and Time?

218
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:13,760
No. You can only use that room for
two days during your lifetime, right?

219
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,550
There might be a time
afterward that they need it.

220
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,350
It's okay. Knowing these two,

221
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,110
they'll make Fusion their own
in a considerably short time.

222
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,480
Let's begin!

223
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,740
Piccolo, you be sure to learn this well yourself.

224
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,460
Trunks, Goten, hang in there!

225
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,970
You two, stop your endless sobbing!

226
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,470
You guys are going to defeat Majin Boo!

227
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:06,150
<i>Trunks and Goten are about</i>
<i>to be taught Fusion from Goku.</i>

228
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:12,110
<i>Gohan is about to dare to</i>
<i>pull out the Z-Sword as well.</i>

229
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:18,570
<i>Will this be the ultimate</i>
<i>weapon to defeat Majin Boo?</i>

230
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,930
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

231
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,520
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

232
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:56,110
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

233
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:02,200
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

234
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,210
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

235
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,590
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

236
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,470
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

237
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:27,520
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

238
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,060
<i>Even now?</i>

239
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,700
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

240
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,120
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

241
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,580
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

242
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:58,630
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

243
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,900
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

244
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:19,490
<i>Hey, Gohan, unless you turn</i>
<i>Super Saiyan, you ain't gonna be able</i>

245
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,530
<i>to pull out that whatever-it's-called sword.</i>

246
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:28,330
<i>Oh?! Impossible! How can</i>
<i>a human pull that sword out?!</i>

247
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,250
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

248
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,630
<i>"It Came Ou~t!!</i>
<i>The Legendary Z-Sword."</i>

249
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,510
<i>Goten, Trunks, good luck to you guys, too.</i>

250
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,720
"Next time"
"It Came Ou~t!!
The Legendary Z-Sword"
