<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,840
<i>W-What's this? Goku's battle power is 180,000!</i>

17
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,040
<i>Even Ginyu is stunned by this</i>!

18
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,690
<i>However, at that time, Freeza's devilish hand</i>
<i>was already closing around the Grand Elder,</i>

19
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,430
<i>so he could learn the passcode needed to</i>
<i>have one's wish granted by the Dragon Balls.</i>

20
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:49,620
I will show you the terror of
the strongest being in the universe.

21
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:56,860
<i>"Surprise!! Goku is Ginyu</i>
<i>and Ginyu is Goku."</i>

22
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,450
How audacious it was for them to
attempt to inflict even one injury upon me.

23
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,190
Such extreme examples of
those who did not keep their places.

24
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,660
Now then, Grand Elder<i>-san,</i>
it would appear that there is

25
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,970
still one foolish individual out
here who does not know his place.

26
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,680
I believe that if this
gentleman were about to be killed,

27
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,980
you would soon change your mind and tell me

28
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,750
how to have the Dragon Balls grant my wish.

29
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,060
You will also regret not
having spoken up sooner,

30
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,620
while you were still unharmed.

31
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,360
If you like, we can spare
your life right here and now.

32
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,200
You've probably already realized this,

33
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,840
but Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> has
only a short time left to live.

34
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,070
It would be bad for you and I both

35
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,650
if we were to fight here,
with him caught in the middle.

36
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,450
We will change our location.

37
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,890
I do not anticipate the extent
of our fight to be that great,

38
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,660
but very well.

39
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,760
Anywhere you like.

40
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,690
My apologies, Nail.
Please find a way to hold out

41
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,070
long enough for Dende to reach the Earthlings.

42
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:22,940
At this point, the fate of
our planet rests in their hands.

43
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,580
C-Commander Ginyu!

44
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,800
What are you laughing about?

45
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,810
How can I <i>not</i> laugh about this?

46
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,350
I didn't think anyone could be as strong as you.

47
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,580
So why laugh?

48
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,960
Because I'm happy to have found someone
much stronger than even I, Ginyu<i>-sama.</i>

49
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,740
Yes, yes! Such strength!

50
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,140
I'm so happy! I'm so happy!

51
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,810
It's been quite a while
since I've been so happy!

52
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,250
I'm so glad to be alive!

53
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,530
W-What?!

54
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,370
Jheese...

55
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,810
Y-Yes, sir.

56
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,380
S-So that's it! Commander Ginyu...

57
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,580
Take care that you do not drop my Scouter.

58
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,920
That's it, all right!

59
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,070
How far away are you going?

60
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,000
This is far enough!

61
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,910
There is no need to distance
ourselves any farther than this, is there?

62
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,930
I suppose not.

63
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,070
My, my. Those who wish to die certainly account

64
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,440
for a large number of this planet's inhabitants.

65
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,810
How troubling.

66
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,940
This is amazing! Your battle
power has risen to 42,000.

67
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:30,520
I see now. You certainly are quite
different from the other Namekians.

68
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,320
I am surprised. It is a wonderful battle power.

69
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,530
You certainly live up to your
classification as a "warrior-type."

70
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,530
I wish you were among my ranks.

71
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,540
Well, shall I inform you of the
battle power rating which I possess,

72
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,470
to use as a reference as you
begin your fight against me?

73
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,440
My battle power rating is...

74
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,480
530,000.

75
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,480
However, naturally I do not intend
to use my full power against you,

76
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,890
so you need not worry.

77
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,490
What?!

78
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,530
I know! What if I were to fight
using only my left hand for you?

79
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,930
That might make it more enjoyable.

80
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,030
Enough!

81
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,920
No, this will not do. Here
I stretched out my neck for you

82
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:42,920
so that you could not
miss, and this is all you have?

83
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,560
On the other hand, this is
about right for someone at 42,000.

84
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,920
Oh my, that was impolite of me.

85
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,330
I will return it to you.

86
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,040
You should not be straining
yourself so, should you?

87
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,680
I think it would be best for you
if you spoke, before you get killed.

88
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,940
This is a surprise!

89
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,510
You can regenerate?

90
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,510
Although, while you may be back in
one piece, your situation has not changed.

91
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,850
It appears that you cannot
regenerate your energy, as well.

92
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,480
Your battle power has dropped.

93
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,500
My, my. After having been
shown how mismatched you are,

94
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,530
you still wish to continue?

95
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:35,600
I have no idea what the people
of this planet must be thinking.

96
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:40,540
I will not allow you...

97
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,850
I will not allow you to...

98
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,200
W-What is this? What is going on here, exactly?

99
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,370
Does this planet have something
personal against me, or something?

100
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,950
<i>This time, I've had it for sure!</i>

101
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,290
<i>Lucky! If I can just make it into that cave...</i>

102
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,470
<i>Just a little farther...</i>

103
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,340
I-I made it! I'm saved!

104
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,350
Huh? Have I been saved?

105
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,930
This is so mean of you!

106
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,180
This is it! This time for sure!

107
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,560
Farewell, everyone!

108
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,630
Yow!

109
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,240
What? What happened?

110
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,640
Here.

111
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,120
Stay back! You pervert, grabber,
idiot, monster, whatever you are!

112
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,090
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

113
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:09,530
G-Gohan<i>-kun</i>! T-Then...

114
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,530
How could you, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

115
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,130
How terrible. There wasn't even any warning–

116
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:21,740
What have the two of you been up to?!

117
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,540
No sooner do you show up suddenly
with Vegeta and take the Dragon Ball away,

118
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,140
then you take off with him to someplace else!

119
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,740
Now, I want to know just what's going on!

120
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,150
Do you think you can just leave
a delicate lady unattended out here

121
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,150
in such a dangerous place,
and get away with it?!

122
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:41,060
B-B-But didn't we just
rescue you from that dinosaur?

123
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,090
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>, at any rate,
we need the Dragon Radar!

124
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,930
If everything works out, we may
still be able to get our wish granted!

125
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,070
What's this? You still haven't
gotten our wish granted?

126
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,070
I saw from the Radar all seven Dragon
Balls had been gathered in one place.

127
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,270
I was sure you were the ones
who had gotten them together,

128
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,910
and I was on my way to meet you.

129
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,910
And now what do I hear?

130
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,550
Unbelievable. What sort of
goofing-off have you been up to?

131
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,920
G-Goofing-off, she says. Scratch, scratch...

132
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,120
Bulma<i>-san</i>, pardon me for a second.

133
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,930
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, I've got it. It's that way!

134
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,930
Okay, we're off!

135
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:23,100
Hold on! Tell me what's going on!

136
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,970
We're in a hurry right now,
so we'll explain later.

137
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,140
Bulma<i>-san</i>, please wait
for us back at that island.

138
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:35,110
Huh?! You've got to be kidding!
You expect me to walk back from here?

139
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,920
How can you? This is so mean of you!

140
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,050
Oh yeah, Father has arrived!

141
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:49,500
R-Really? How is he?
Has he gotten much stronger?

142
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,660
Gohan, let's hurry!

143
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,330
Right!

144
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,950
Son<i>-kun</i>, huh?

145
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,620
I didn't think he would
turn out as handsome as he did.

146
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,060
With Yamucha as my boyfriend,
all he and I have ever done is fight...

147
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,310
Maybe I blew it.

148
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,860
Wha–wha–

149
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,370
What are you doing?!

150
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,170
What the?

151
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:20,850
Y-You're not a... Super Saiyan...

152
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:27,820
...b-but I've still taken a liking...
to that strong body of yours.

153
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,860
T-Taken a liking?

154
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,580
S-Sure enough, Commander
Ginyu is planning on doing <i>that...</i>

155
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,600
<i>Amazing! How was he able to</i>
<i>find that much power in his condition?</i>

156
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,880
H-Here it comes...

157
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,020
<i>C-Change!!</i>

158
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:37,090
H-How come... I'm... over... there?

159
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,370
I've made an exchange, your body for mine.

160
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:49,430
Y-You did what?

161
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,370
Commander Ginyu!

162
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,800
Here's your Scouter.

163
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,040
All right, we're returning to the ship.

164
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,810
Freeza<i>-sama</i> may be on his way back, as well.

165
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,610
Yes, sir!

166
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,060
This body is even faster!

167
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,830
I... can't... move!

168
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,460
So this is the reason why he injured himself...

169
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:34,480
Oh no! At this rate I, I mean,
he and Kuririn will meet up!

170
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,720
Dammit, not only am
I unfamiliar with this body,

171
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,850
but with this wound, I can't fly so well.

172
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,360
<i>On top of that, if I manage</i>
<i>to safely get back to Earth,</i>

173
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,260
<i>I'll probably just get Chichi angry at me again.</i>

174
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,860
<i>L-Look at the face I've got now!</i>

175
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,340
<i>I'm done for!</i>

176
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:12,880
<i>What's this? Goku and</i>
<i>Ginyu have exchanged bodies</i>!

177
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,980
<i>Flying toward Freeza's spaceship</i>
<i>in search of the Dragon Balls were</i>

178
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,890
<i>Gohan, Kuririn, Vegeta, and Ginyu</i>!

179
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:29,360
<i>The battle revolving around the Dragon</i>
<i>Balls has taken yet another radical turn</i>!

180
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

181
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

182
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

183
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

184
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

185
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

186
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

187
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

188
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

189
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

190
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

191
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

192
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

193
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

194
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

195
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

196
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,040
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

197
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,940
<i>Kuririn! Gohan! That's Ginyu!</i>

198
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,440
<i>There's no way you'll be beaten by him now!</i>

199
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,750
<i>N-No way! That body is yours!</i>
<i>We don't have a chance of winning!</i>

200
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,850
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

201
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,050
<i>"Come Forth, Super Shen Long!!</i>
<i>Grant Me My Wish."</i>

202
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,300
<i>We came all the way to</i>
<i>Planet Namek for this moment!</i>

203
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,230
"Next time"
"Come Forth, Super Shen Long!!
Grant Me My Wish"
