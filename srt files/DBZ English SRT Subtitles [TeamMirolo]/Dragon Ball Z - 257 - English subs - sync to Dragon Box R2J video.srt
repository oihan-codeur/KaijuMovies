<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,370
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,090
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,020
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,770
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,680
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,680
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,060
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,230
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,070
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,900
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,160
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,080
I've killed all the Earthlings. Now,
I will fight. Gimme the guy I will fight!

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,710
Understood! But we have to prepare
for the fight. Give me some time!

25
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,710
Two hours–no, just one hour will be fine!

26
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,380
Please!

27
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:46,590
One hour? How long is that?

28
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,390
Once all the sand in this sandglass has fallen.

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,900
<i>In the face of a Majin Boo that</i>
<i>has become the ultimate in evil,</i>

30
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,110
<i>only one hour's worth of time remains.</i>

31
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,530
<i>Having come to this, there is no choice</i>

32
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,900
<i>but to have Goten and Trunks</i>
<i>train in the Room of Spirit and Time.</i>

33
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,750
<i>"The Special Training Is a Success!!</i>
<i>You're Finished Now, Majin Boo."</i>

34
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,980
That's Majin Boo?!

35
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,980
He really has changed, huh?

36
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,270
And not just his shape, either.

37
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,190
Everything about him is
positively greater than before.

38
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,620
Now you understand, right?

39
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,580
Now, hurry and go into
the Room of Spirit and Time.

40
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,080
For every one minute here,
you can train for six hours in there.

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,540
Don't dilly-dally around!

42
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,260
Mother!

43
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,180
W-What?

44
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,390
W-What does she think she's doing?! That idiot!

45
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,480
Rotten Majin Boo!
How dare you kill Gohan-<i>chan</i>?!

46
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,730
Give him back! Give me back Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

47
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
Turn into an egg.

48
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,860
M-Mother...

49
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,700
Dammit... dammit...!

50
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,410
Dammit...

51
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,490
–Dammit!
–Hold yourself back, Goten!

52
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,490
Do you want all of this to be for nothing?!

53
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,870
Damn you, Majin Boo! How dare you...!

54
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,370
Goten...

55
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,260
Listen! We can bring your mother
back to life with the Dragon Balls!

56
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,550
That is, if you and Trunks defeat Majin Boo!

57
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,900
However, with your power now,
that's not possible, so you have to train!

58
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,610
In the short remaining time,
you have to desperately train!

59
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,240
Got it?

60
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,160
L-Let's go do it, Goten!

61
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,160
We'll train really well, and
then we'll flatten Majin Boo! Okay?

62
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,250
A-All right...!

63
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,760
Sure is hot in here! I wonder
if they have a cooler or anything.

64
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:24,980
Besides that, our bodies
seem heavier. Right, Goten?

65
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,490
W-Well, there's no reason
to be in that big a hurry, right?

66
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:38,410
Out there it's just one hour, but in here,
he said we would have all of 15 days!

67
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,130
You know something, this
is one awful place in here!

68
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:58,800
Hey Goten! All we have for food is
some yucky-looking powder and water!

69
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,180
What's going on? This is
unbelievable, completely!

70
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,480
W-Wait up!

71
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,650
Y-Yow! Let's do this together!

72
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,360
Um...

73
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:27,670
Majin Boo appeared to know who
my father is. Do you know why that is?

74
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,670
Yeah.

75
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,670
W-Why is it? I don't understand it at all.

76
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,960
It's simple.

77
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,300
Mister Satan is the only human that
Majin Boo has let his guard down to.

78
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,520
When we were trying to do anything
we could by force, Mister Satan,

79
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,770
no matter his motives, chose
to become Majin Boo's friend.

80
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,070
As proof of that, even though
every earthling has been exterminated,

81
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,530
only Mister Satan was not killed.

82
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,490
Even though he has become
nothing but a destructive beast like that,

83
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,410
at least that memory of him remains.

84
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,590
Even though he may not
be able to match us in power,

85
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:16,170
your father really is the
proud World Champion.

86
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,590
Papa...!

87
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:42,120
No more!! I won't wait any more!!

88
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,030
W-What?!

89
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,720
Wait! It hasn't even been 30 minutes yet!

90
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,850
You've got to give us at
least a little more time!

91
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,660
No way. I won't wait any more. I will fight!

92
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,370
Come on out! I'll kill you!

93
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,100
H-How come?

94
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,700
R-Right now, we'd better
go call Trunks and Goten out!

95
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,030
They've gotten way stronger now, I'm sure!

96
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,530
They just barely went in there, you know!

97
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,560
Yow-ow-ow-ow...

98
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,890
What's going on?

99
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,320
Okay, I'll let you fight. Come with me.

100
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,790
This way.

101
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,630
H-Hey! Is Piccolo planning to let
Majin Boo fight with Goten and Trunks

102
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:48,680
inside the Room of Spirit and Time?

103
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,690
Why would he make them fight
in the Room of Spirit and Time?

104
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,650
I think it's because once they're
inside the Room of Spirit and Time,

105
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,120
then even if Trunks-<i>san</i> and
Goten-<i>san</i> were to lose or anything,

106
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,120
you can destroy the entrance,
and seal that world up inside.

107
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,500
It is a separate dimension from this world,
and they will be unable to come out again.

108
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,500
Whoa...!

109
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,070
S-So then, what happens
to Trunks and Goten-<i>kun</i>?

110
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,360
It is all right. Even if killed,

111
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,610
it is possible to bring the two of
them back to life with the Dragon Balls.

112
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:56,040
Hmm... Piccolo has put
together an outstanding strategy.

113
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,290
How nice and bouncy...!

114
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,960
–Still higher?
–That's right.

115
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,280
Good grief! They're this way!

116
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,710
Can't you show some kindness to the elderly?

117
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,460
Anyhow, aren't they taking
quite a long way around?

118
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,420
Yes, they are. If they had
turned at the last corner,

119
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,590
they would have been right there.

120
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,970
He's buying whatever little time that he can.

121
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:58,010
Piccolo said that one minute
here is six hours in there, you know.

122
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,360
Still farther?! How far are we going?!

123
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,500
Don't be impatient. Your foe is at
the very bottom level of this place.

124
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,670
Bottom?! We were going up before!

125
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,370
You can't get there unless you do.

126
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,540
Say, we did it, huh?

127
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:08,130
Y-Yeah... Awesome! Who knew
there was anything above Super Saiyan?

128
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,500
We can win for sure like this!

129
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,670
Everyone will be completely stunned!

130
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:19,680
But it sure does wear you out! It feels
like we're using up all our power at once!

131
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,520
And this has time as its shortcoming. Look...

132
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,520
We can only be like that
for around five minutes.

133
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,070
Then even the Fusion breaks
up and we return to normal.

134
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,530
If that's so, it's no problem!
We'll just become like we did just now,

135
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,110
and given five minutes,
we can beat him for sure!

136
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:41,490
Dummy! That won't be very exciting!
We've trained for a whole week!

137
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:44,540
The way I'm thinking, I figure that
even in our regular Fusion state,

138
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:51,040
we've improved to about
the same level as Majin Boo.

139
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,550
Now listen! Let's make them think that
by having about the same amount of power,

140
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,010
the fight will be drawn out.

141
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:58,930
Everyone will get anxious.

142
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,680
After all, we can only hold
Fusion for thirty minutes.

143
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,480
But then, with five minutes to go,

144
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,520
we become Ultra Super Saiyan like
we just did, and put him away in a flash!

145
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,900
What do you think?
It will be totally cool, right?!

146
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,530
Sure! You're gonna panic,
Majin Boo, you scumbag! Take that!

147
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:26,080
We'll avenge my Papa,
Gohan-<i>san</i>, and Goten's Mama!

148
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,620
Yeah! Let's do it!

149
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,970
Still further?!

150
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,310
<i>That's his limit...</i>

151
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,480
A little further.

152
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,320
Can you hear me,
Trunks and Goten? It's me, Piccolo.

153
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,700
I'm speaking into your minds now.

154
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,120
O-Our minds?

155
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,750
Be quiet and listen well. Ready?

156
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,090
It turns out you'll have to fight
Majin Boo earlier than we planned.

157
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,090
I'm headed your way now with Majin Boo.

158
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,100
Th-That's bad! We just
barely got done with Fusion!

159
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:31,100
That will be okay. I'm buying time
by purposely taking the long way.

160
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,350
It should be a good deal of time in there.

161
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,150
Get yourselves ready to fight now
by getting some rest! Go to sleep!

162
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,450
I can probably draw it out another minute.

163
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:49,450
That will be six hours of your time there.

164
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:50,950
Got it?

165
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,830
Six hours will be plenty!

166
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:03,220
Once Piccolo-<i>san</i> learns how great we've
been training, he'll be so surprised, huh?

167
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,520
Say, how about something to eat?

168
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:15,100
Don't need to!! Enough already!!
You made us walk this long! I'll kill you!

169
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,440
O-Okay...

170
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,410
In here.

171
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,430
This is a strange place.

172
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,700
–Dum, dum dum–
–Dumm!

173
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:08,700
–We've been waiting for you...
–Majin Boo!

174
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,160
All right, that was perfect!

175
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,710
Them?

176
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,130
That's right.

177
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:22,090
Please, let there be a miracle...

178
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,970
Hey, the only spectator
is going to be Piccolo-<i>san.</i>

179
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,640
That's kind of disappointing.

180
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,510
Really, them?

181
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,640
That's right.

182
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:35,310
Well, that's okay. No choice
but to do like we planned.

183
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,520
–You're finished now...
–Majin Boo!

184
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:46,490
I was right, me just saying
"Majin Boo" was a let-down.

185
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,620
That's because you couldn't
remember your line, isn't it?

186
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,620
It was a waste to wait for this!

187
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,620
Stop complaining and let's
keep going, otherwise you'll forget.

188
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,620
Yeah, okay.

189
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,790
–Here we go!
–Okay!

190
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,800
O-Ouch! Hold on a minute, you!
You didn't give any warning!

191
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,510
I can't believe you! What an idiot! Really!

192
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,310
Stop and think a minute!

193
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,480
We were just about to do
something awesome, you know!

194
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,190
Just wait! Okay? Got it?

195
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,820
Let's do it over! Don't move!

196
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,150
This takes a lot of nerve
even without you doing that.

197
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,450
Let's go again, Goten!

198
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,040
Right! Ready, set...

199
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,460
"Fu–"

200
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,460
W-What?! Why aren't they
starting this as Super Saiyans?!

201
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,880
"–sion Ha!!"

202
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,430
All right, good! Right from the
start, they've merged perfectly!

203
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,240
Dum-dum-dum-dumm! It's Gotenks!

204
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,040
You, huh? I remember!

205
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,590
You're the guy I beat to a pulp before!

206
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:29,050
You stupid dirtbag!

207
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:33,600
You're badly mistaken if you
think I'm the same as I was before!

208
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,560
My time is limited!

209
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,100
I'll show you right away how I'm
different from how I was before!

210
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,940
H-He certainly is different!
He certainly is greatly powered-up!

211
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,480
C-Can this possibly mean...?

212
00:21:56,620 --> 00:22:00,540
Can I attack you yet?

213
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,620
J-Just a moment, okay?

214
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,550
<i>Th-This is strange. That should have</i>
<i>had some kind of effect on him. Aha!</i>

215
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,430
<i>He must be trying hard not to show his pain!</i>

216
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,560
<i>Gotenks finds himself in a</i>
<i>great pinch right from the start.</i>

217
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,310
<i>Fight like you mean it!</i>

218
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,810
<i>Life is not as easy as you might think!</i>

219
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,860
Th-This might be hopeless!

220
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,910
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

221
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,500
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

222
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,050
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

223
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,180
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

224
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:09,190
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

225
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,570
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

226
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,450
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

227
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:27,500
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

228
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,040
<i>Even now?</i>

229
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:36,680
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

230
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,060
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

231
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:48,560
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

232
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:58,610
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

233
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,720
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

234
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,680
<i>He can win! The way he is now,</i>

235
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,510
<i>Gotenks can definitely beat Majin Boo!</i>

236
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,850
<i>At least he should be able to.</i>
<i>What is he doing?!</i>

237
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,680
<i>Don't worry about nonsense</i>
<i>like the aesthetics of your fighting,</i>

238
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,190
<i>just go at him with all</i>
<i>you've got, right from the start!</i>

239
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:29,310
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

240
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,400
<i>"'I'm Going Like I Mean It!!'</i>
<i>A Wide-Open Super Gotenks."</i>

241
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,570
<i>There it is! His finishing move!</i>

242
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,440
<i>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack?</i>

243
