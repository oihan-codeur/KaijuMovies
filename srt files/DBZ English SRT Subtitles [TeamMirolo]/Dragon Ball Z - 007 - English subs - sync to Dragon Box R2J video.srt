<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,100
Great King Yama<i>-sama</i>, please
allow this man to travel to Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

17
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,220
Earnestly press on as you travel
along this serpent, if you please.

18
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,020
It leads to where Kaio<i>-sama</i> is.

19
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,400
We managed to deal with the guy who
kidnapped you, but in a year from now,

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,240
it seems that some even more
terrible friends of his will be coming.

21
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,940
We need your power too.

22
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,320
Train yourself to learn the tactics
of fighting, and defend the Earth!

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,220
<i>Son Gohan, the weakling with</i>
<i>a great power buried within him.</i>

24
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,290
<i>What kind of training</i>
<i>will Piccolo be assigning him?</i>

25
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:06,010
<i>"Survival with Dinosaurs!</i>
<i>Gohan's Harsh Training."</i>

26
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,130
What should I do for training?

27
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,140
W-What should I do to train?

28
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,840
To begin with, you don't
need to do anything. Just live.

29
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,340
Live?

30
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,550
Right. Try surviving all by yourself
without anything happening to you.

31
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,320
If you can survive without incident
for six months, I'll teach you how to fight.

32
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,200
Six months, by myself, in this place?

33
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,510
No way! I'll die of loneliness!

34
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,340
You won't be lonesome.

35
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:19,720
This place is teaming with
beasts that are thirsting for blood.

36
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:26,220
No, don't do this! Don't leave me here!

37
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,060
Right now, you don't
have time to be spoiled!

38
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,290
But...

39
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,230
Survive somehow for the next six
months, and make yourself tougher,

40
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,830
both physically and mentally.

41
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:47,170
Do not forget that you hold the
key to Earth's fate in your hand.

42
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,170
Believe in your own power.

43
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,180
And learn some way to
effectively draw out that power.

44
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,580
But I...

45
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,020
See you later. Oh, right, right.

46
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,690
Don't think about trying to escape from here.

47
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,460
This place is surrounded by
nothing but expansive hellish desert.

48
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,900
In other words,

49
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,270
it's a world of death that's enough
to make this place look like heaven.

50
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,870
Wait! Where is there
any food? What about baths?

51
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,240
What about a bed? What about books,
and notebooks, and pencils, and...

52
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,080
You think there's any of that
arranged for you here, sonny boy?

53
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,920
Oh, no!

54
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,250
That's horrible!

55
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:37,320
If you have to blame something,
then blame your own fate. The way I do.

56
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,960
Wait!

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,100
I'm scared! Don't leave me here!

58
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:29,950
Kami<i>-sama</i> look strange.
Something wrong?

59
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:38,680
Sure enough, there's something different
about Piccolo from how he was before.

60
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,690
He's still unmistakably evil,

61
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,390
but I sense that the devious abrasiveness
he had in the past is fading away.

62
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:52,360
Popo thinks so too. The old Daimao
not make Son Goku's son strong.

63
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,000
What made me clearly realize that there
was something strange about Piccolo...

64
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,040
...was that when Son Goku's
brother Raditz was killed by him,

65
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,310
his spirit went right to the Other World.

66
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,790
Up until now, whenever anyone
was killed by the Demon Clan,

67
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,800
their spirit had been unable to pass beyond,

68
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,030
and they drifted through
the air, as they suffered.

69
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,240
Did a guy named Raditz wash up here?

70
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,710
Yeah, he was here all right.

71
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,540
And yet, since Raditz had
gone to the Other World,

72
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,040
Piccolo is clearly different
from how he was before.

73
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,580
You mean Piccolo has good heart?

74
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:52,690
Perhaps he realizes it too.
My life–and thus Piccolo's life

75
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,100
–has only one more year left in it.

76
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,930
One more year?

77
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,700
Whether it's because Piccolo will be killed by
the Saiyans that are to arrive in another year,

78
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:12,240
or whether it's because that is when
my lifetime will run out, I do not know.

79
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,650
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

80
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,720
My death means death for Piccolo,
and Piccolo's death means death for me.

81
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,030
Even being Kami,

82
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,100
it is not a pleasant thing to know
the time when one's death will come.

83
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,070
He has to be sensing it too.

84
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,070
Maybe he just wants to leave
something of himself behind,

85
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:41,810
even if it is to Son Goku's son.

86
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,110
Then, possibility of using Dragon Balls...

87
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,420
This next time will be the last one.

88
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm scared!

89
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,540
Ee-yow!

90
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,050
Wait up!

91
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:14,440
You didn't have to go
around my neck like that.

92
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,080
I had no idea at all that
Gohan was as strong as all that.

93
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,650
He is my son, after all...

94
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,030
That's right! I don't have to run
along the entire road at all, huh?

95
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,130
All right then!

96
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,310
At this rate, I'll get there in no time!

97
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,490
That was close, that was close!
That's hell there beneath the clouds.

98
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,400
Son Goku has...
unfortunately... been killed.

99
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:04,340
I wonder if the shock
will be too much like that.

100
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,670
Um, I'm terribly sorry,
but Goku will not be returning,

101
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,340
and has entered his eternal sleep.

102
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,580
Then again, he is coming back to life, huh?

103
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,350
That's it! I'll do it cheerfully! Yeah!

104
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:22,790
Goku died, but he's coming back
to life right away, so don't worry.

105
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,930
Kuririn!

106
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:29,760
G-G-Good afternoon.

107
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,560
What are you doing out
here, mumbling to yourself?

108
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:38,770
W-Well, you see, um... as it happens...

109
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,770
Heya! It's been a while!

110
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,340
G-Good afternoon... That's nice of you...

111
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,290
Aren't you together
with Goku<i>-sa</i> and the others?

112
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,660
Yeah, um, the truth is, Goku has d-d-

113
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,160
d-d-d-...

114
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,920
What?

115
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,960
...d-don't worry, he says!

116
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,730
What's that?
So he is goin' to be late?

117
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:13,470
Yeah, um, yes. The truth is,
the late Goku will not be returning...

118
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,070
He said he's not comin' home?

119
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,640
Er, no, he'll be
returning to us very soon...

120
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,590
I don't get what it is you're sayin'!

121
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,480
Now, now, it's no good
to stand here talkin' like this!

122
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,980
Come on in the house!
Come on, come on!

123
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,630
I can't wait to see
my grandson's happy face!

124
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,130
I ain't even seen him in a over year now.

125
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,540
I bet he's gotten a lot bigger, huh?

126
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,610
<i>I can't handle this. I can't tell them.</i>
<i>Not that he won't be back for a year...</i>

127
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,080
Nobody's told me anythin',
so I called the Kame House earlier,

128
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,710
but nobody was there.

129
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,080
Y-Yeah, come to mention it,

130
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,950
everyone's gone off to some
uninhabited island somewhere to play.

131
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,790
That must be it.

132
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,960
You wouldn't be able to
reach them there... would you?

133
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,530
But Goku<i>-sa</i> and them will
be back by nighttime, yeah?

134
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,130
Y-Yeah... I suppose...

135
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:18,940
Goku<i>-sa</i> aside, Gohan has his
studyin', you know? He can't just skip it.

136
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,240
You know, Goku<i>-sa</i>
can't do anythin' as a parent!

137
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,710
Don't go gettin' so jumpy, Chichi.
This is Goku we're talkin' about.

138
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,950
He'll be sure to bring
him home. Just relax.

139
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,560
Really? You're right. Good.
They'll probably be comin' back hungry,

140
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,720
so I better go make some dinner.

141
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,790
Um...

142
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,160
I should be heading on back soon...

143
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,960
B-But why? You just
barely got here, didn'cha?

144
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,300
You could wait here until
Goku<i>-sa</i> and Gohan get back.

145
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,400
At least have some dinner first!

146
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,710
B-But I have things to attend to...

147
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,240
Look, don't worry, don't worry.

148
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,560
Mother!

149
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,290
Help! Somebody help!

150
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,670
I can't get down!

151
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,650
Come on, come on,
they're goin' to burn!

152
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,720
Eat up, eat up!

153
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,020
Before long, Goku will
be bringin' Gohan home!

154
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,890
I can't stand for this any longer!

155
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,920
Ogre spirits.

156
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,160
One crazy dancer drink.

157
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,760
Sure, sure...

158
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,730
Here's my check.

159
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,930
Thanks for coming.
Here's your change.

160
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:16,940
10,000... 20,000... 30,000...
40,000... I'm 10,000 short.

161
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,780
I beg your pardon.

162
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,350
<i>H-How creepy!</i>

163
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,550
...and so, he said he does not wish
to be brought back to life for one year.

164
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:31,920
I see. And I should
tell this to the Turtle guy?

165
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:35,090
Yes. Please be sure not to forget.

166
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,740
Goku is a curious one, huh?
He still wants to become stronger?

167
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,480
Damn... that guy lied to me!

168
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,850
He said I wouldn't get hungry,
but here I am, hungry!

169
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,660
I'm scared and cold!

170
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:16,660
I'm so hungry I could die!

171
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,610
Apples! Some apples
fell down! How lucky!

172
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,800
Oh well...

173
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,340
Yuck, they're sour!

174
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:02,550
I want some juice or something to
drink! I want to eat <i>shao mai</i> dumplings!

175
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:18,020
I want my mother's curry!

176
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,020
Dirty brat! Give me trouble, will you?

177
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,800
I'm scared!

178
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:11,680
<i>Now listen, this is the</i>
<i>last time I lend you a hand...</i>

179
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,750
<i>From here on, if you</i>
<i>are unable to survive,</i>

180
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:19,360
<i>then that's all you're worth as a kid.</i>

181
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,930
<i>Exhausted, Son Gohan sleeps.</i>

182
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:25,600
<i>There's no way he could have known</i>

183
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,670
<i>that one of his moments</i>
<i>of destiny was drawing near.</i>

184
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

185
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

186
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,870
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

187
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,370
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

188
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

189
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,950
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

190
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

191
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,120
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

192
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

193
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,700
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

194
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

195
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,600
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

196
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,280
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

197
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,450
<i>So sorry.</i>

198
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

199
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,530
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

200
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:14,810
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

201
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,670
<i>There's going to be a</i>
<i>full moon over earth tonight.</i>

202
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,480
<i>I wonder if Gohan will be all right.</i>

203
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,980
<i>Wow! The moon is completely round!</i>

204
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,880
<i>W-What's going on?! His</i>
<i>destructive power is extraordinary!</i>

205
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,980
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

206
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,360
<i>"A Great Transformation on a Moonlit Night!</i>
<i>The Secret of Gohan's Power."</i>

207
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:36,530
<i>Father, do you really think</i>
<i>I can become a great scholar?</i>

208
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,260
"Next time"
"A Great Transformation on a Moonlit Night!
The Secret of Gohan's Power."
