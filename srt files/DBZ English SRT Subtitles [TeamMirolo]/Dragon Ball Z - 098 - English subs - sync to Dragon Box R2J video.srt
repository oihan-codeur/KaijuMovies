<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,970
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,290
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,660
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:04,670
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,650
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:26,600
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,170
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,660
Disappear, together with the whole planet!

17
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,530
I'll blow you away!

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,380
<i>Namek's core is destroyed</i>
<i>by Freeza's tremendous power!</i>

19
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,220
In five more minutes, this
planet will vanish into space dust!

20
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,320
Five minutes is plenty.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,530
I will defeat you, and take off
with my friends in my spaceship!

22
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,300
Unfortunately for you,
I am the one with the better hope.

23
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,180
I'll show you my 100 percent, full power!

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,350
I can't allow you to stall for time!

25
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm bringing this to a conclusion!

26
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,560
<i>"I Will Be the One Who Wins...</i>
<i>Risking Survival, a Final Attack."</i>

27
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,400
What's wrong?!

28
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,530
Are you so afraid you'll wear yourself
out, you can't put out your full power?!

29
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,150
<i>Don't get...</i>

30
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,850
Don't get so...

31
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,500
...carried away!!

32
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,670
You underestimated me, didn't you?

33
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,680
Let me tell you that this
is still not my full power!

34
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,810
That was only about 70 percent.

35
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,590
And, starting now...

36
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,760
...your long-awaited 100 percent!

37
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:58,570
<i>I'll settle this with my full power</i>
<i>in one minute–no, thirty seconds!</i>

38
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,290
It's no good! I can't find Bulma<i>-san</i>'s <i>ki</i> at all!

39
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,160
And you know, something is
beginning to happen to this planet!

40
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,860
Something beyond hope!

41
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,130
Besides which, Freeza's <i>ki</i>
seems to again be getting greater!

42
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,330
What can it mean?

43
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,150
W-Whatever happens, you
just watch me live through this!

44
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,660
Somebody, hurry and come save me!

45
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,330
Please!

46
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,530
Incredible! His <i>ki</i> is
billowing up and filling him out!

47
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,630
<i>So this is finally the realization</i>
<i>of his 100 percent power, is it?</i>

48
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,210
What are you doing, Goku?!

49
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,840
Goku, can you hear me?! Hey!

50
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,910
Now! Now is your chance!

51
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,120
Now, while Freeza concentrates
his power, is your chance to attack!

52
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,490
Hey, Goku! Do you not hear my voice?!

53
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:48,130
That can't be possible!
Goku, now is your only–

54
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,500
I do hear you, Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

55
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,810
There's no doubt, I probably ain't
going to get a second chance at this.

56
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,510
That chance to see with my own eyes
the strongest scumbag in the universe

57
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,950
at his full power, that is.

58
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,520
W-What did you say?!

59
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:15,820
Goku, are you even
aware of what you are saying?

60
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,530
<i>...seventy-eight... seventy-nine...</i>

61
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,870
<i>...eighty...</i>

62
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,870
<i>...eighty-one...</i>

63
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,540
Hey! What the hell is the matter with you?!

64
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,850
I... I want to fight Freeza.

65
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,550
<i>...eighty-four... eighty-five...</i>

66
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,520
And...

67
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,220
win!

68
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:58,230
Such foolishness! This isn't a game, Goku!

69
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,510
I am going to avenge
Kuririn! He has died twice!

70
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,540
He cannot return to life,
even with the Dragon Balls!

71
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,850
Kuririn was a good guy!

72
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,190
A really good guy.

73
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:20,890
My very best friend!

74
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,820
And he blew him to bits...

75
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,490
But there's no reason to
wait for him to reach full power!

76
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,900
Besides, what about Gohan and the others?

77
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,830
It's all right.

78
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,860
Gohan and the others will be saved.

79
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,380
Where are you? Where are you, Bulma<i>-san</i>?!

80
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,710
N-No way! I don't want
to die in a place like this!

81
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,690
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

82
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,990
What have you all been up to?!

83
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,860
I was nearly worried out of my mind!

84
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,360
What exactly is up with this planet?!

85
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,360
Leaving me behind by
myself in such a dangerous place!

86
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,000
What is going on with Kuririn and Son<i>-kun</i>?!

87
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,670
I'll explain what's happening later.
Right now, we have to hurry!

88
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,670
Hurry? To where?

89
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,010
I know, the spaceship
Son<i>-kun</i> came in, right?!

90
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,340
We can go home now, right?!

91
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,680
Yeah.

92
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,710
Hooray!

93
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,310
Where's Gohan<i>-chan</i>?!
What's happenin' to Gohan<i>-chan</i>?!

94
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,640
There's only two reasons
this high-performance monitor

95
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,980
would stop sending images.

96
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,720
The first case is the
spaceship has been vaporized.

97
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,320
The second case...

98
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,320
is that something irregular is
affecting Planet Namek's axis,

99
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,320
causing fluctuations in its magnetic field,

100
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,160
thus causing electromagnetic
waves to become unstable.

101
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,700
What kind of conditions are those?

102
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,340
Uh, you might call it a portent
of the destruction of Planet Namek.

103
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:08,050
In any case, Goku and
Gohan<i>-kun...</i> and even Bulma...

104
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,520
...ninety-three percent...
ninety-four percent... almost there!

105
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:48,390
Freeza, the reason I'm waiting for
you to reach your full power like this,

106
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:51,360
is because I want to demolish
you when you're at your best!

107
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,700
That's so I won't have
any regrets as a warrior.

108
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,700
As for you, you must have come to
want to try out your full power, right?

109
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,040
Otherwise, you would have blasted
the planet again and finished it off.

110
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,220
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

111
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,350
That guy is no longer Son Goku.

112
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:23,390
He is now a warrior of fury, a Super Saiyan.

113
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,710
Sorry to keep you waiting.

114
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,410
This is the full power you wanted.

115
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,020
There ain't time. Let's settle this quickly!

116
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:28,690
Contemptible fool!

117
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,690
W-What?!

118
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:46,700
I-Impossible! That I should
lose sight of them–what speed!

119
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,390
Too slow!

120
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,380
He vanished!

121
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,400
Behind you!

122
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,340
How about that?

123
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,050
That was just me warming
up for my final attack!

124
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,050
I'd hope so...

125
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,390
At such a level, I was just
about to become disappointed.

126
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,940
<i>The time limit is up shortly.</i>

127
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:18,080
<i>Can Goku settle his fight</i>
<i>with Freeza at his full power?</i>

128
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,610
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

129
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:54,450
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

130
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:56,820
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

131
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:05,320
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

132
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,830
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

133
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

134
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,440
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

135
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

136
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,550
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

137
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

138
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,490
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

139
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

140
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,200
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

141
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,370
<i>So sorry.</i>

142
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

143
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

144
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,860
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

145
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,860
<i>Gohan, what are you dawdling around for?!</i>

146
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,530
<i>Hurry up and get out of here!</i>

147
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,340
<i>Kami of Earth, make your</i>
<i>wish to the Dragon Balls be,</i>

148
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,570
<i>"Bring back to life those who</i>
<i>were killed by Freeza and his men."</i>

149
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,540
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

150
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:33,210
<i>"Shen Long, Run Yourself Through Space!!</i>

151
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,420
<i>Please, Kami-sama!</i>

152
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:38,220
"Next time"
"Shen Long, Run Yourself Through Space!!
