00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:24,755
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:30,345
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,105
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:41,695
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,745
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:57,335
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,255
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:03,095
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:05,635
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:08,635
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,645
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:20,195
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:23,065
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,655
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,655
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:31,035
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:34,245
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:37,085
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,875
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:46,175
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:29,925
<i>Having been spat upon by Dabura,</i>
<i>King of the World of Darkness,</i>

24
00:02:29,965 --> 00:02:34,175
<i>Kuririn and Piccolo have</i>
<i>utterly turned to stone!</i>

25
00:02:36,145 --> 00:02:38,015
<i>In order to return them to normal,</i>

26
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:42,895
<i>Goku and the others</i>
<i>enter into the spaceship.</i>

27
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,445
They're here! They're here!

28
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:53,285
They really are simple fools, aren't they?!

29
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:57,035
They have entered our trap.

30
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:02,875
<i>Madoshi Babidi's plan is to gather</i>
<i>the greatest energy in the world,</i>

31
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:09,135
<i>in order to revive Majin Boo, who</i>
<i>was sealed up in the distant past.</i>

32
00:03:28,945 --> 00:03:32,695
Babidi-<i>sama</i> is on the very bottom floor.

33
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:37,075
Unless you pass through the various Stages,

34
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:39,125
and defeat each of the
warriors that come out,

35
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:41,495
you cannot proceed downward.

36
00:03:43,545 --> 00:03:48,505
<i>Goku and the others have made their</i>
<i>way inside Babidi's mysterious spaceship.</i>

37
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:51,425
<i>Will they be able to defeat</i>
<i>the warriors who will appear</i>

38
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:55,935
<i>and reach Babidi's command center?</i>

39
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:58,885
<i>The first Stage has begun!</i>

40
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:06,355
<i>"Don't Toy With Me!!</i>
<i>Vegeta's Breakthrough First Strike of Fury."</i>

41
00:04:09,985 --> 00:04:11,615
Die!

42
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:31,585
You're better than I thought!
But that's as far as this goes!

43
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:20,635
See? Just as I said.

44
00:05:20,675 --> 00:05:24,395
Vegeta alone will be plenty for this.

45
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,455
Over here, fool.

46
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:58,265
Incredible...

47
00:05:58,305 --> 00:05:59,885
Just what we expect of Vegeta-<i>san.</i>

48
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,385
He's a lot more intense than before.

49
00:06:02,425 --> 00:06:06,265
Vegeta has kept up his training as well, huh?

50
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:17,825
What is that Puipui doing?

51
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:20,405
Doesn't he know that unless
he inflicts damage on those men,

52
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:25,825
we can't gather the energy
we need to revive Majin Boo?

53
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,955
Oh, this is where it begins.

54
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:32,665
It appears that Puipui had
left his guard down somewhat.

55
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:36,425
What's the matter? Is that all?

56
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,465
What?

57
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:40,255
Damn you!

58
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:03,365
Hey! Where is it that Puipui is accustomed to?

59
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:07,375
The heavy gravity planet Zun.

60
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:11,125
Hmm, Planet Zun, eh? Okay!

61
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,255
Papparapa!

62
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:33,235
Wh-What? What's happened? Where are we?

63
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:34,945
This is the work of Babidi.

64
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:38,025
He has changed the room with his magic...

65
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:42,825
probably to a place that benefits his fighter.

66
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:44,825
That's really something.

67
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:48,245
But Goku-<i>san</i>, now Vegeta-<i>san</i> is...

68
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:50,205
Well, let's just watch.

69
00:07:56,375 --> 00:08:00,335
You fool! This is as far as you go!

70
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:16,235
This is Planet Zun!
I was raised on this planet!

71
00:08:19,235 --> 00:08:22,275
The gravity here is ten times that of Earth!

72
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:25,485
You guys can't endure this!

73
00:08:32,415 --> 00:08:40,215
What about it? In only ten times
normal gravity, I don't feel a thing.

74
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,385
Wha–

75
00:08:42,425 --> 00:08:45,845
You lie! I know you're bluffing!

76
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:49,135
You'll know whether
I'm bluffing or not soon enough.

77
00:08:49,175 --> 00:08:52,345
Impossible! Die!

78
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,505
I told you I wasn't bluffing, didn't I?

79
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:30,725
Dammit!

80
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,125
He did it!

81
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:05,295
Hmph, that Babidi creep
sent me a worthless opponent!

82
00:10:06,755 --> 00:10:09,175
Look! There's a hole
opening up to let us go down.

83
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:12,095
It's like an elevator, isn't it?

84
00:10:13,765 --> 00:10:16,145
This is like a video game!

85
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:17,725
An insignificant game!

86
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:24,065
Hey! Let's go, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

87
00:10:26,195 --> 00:10:30,695
I-It can't be...! To think that they're so...!

88
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:49,095
Hey, this is the same kind of
room as the last one, ain't it?

89
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:53,975
Yeah, but the room will change
with magic, like it did before, won't it?

90
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:03,695
What are guys with that
kind of power doing on Earth?

91
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:07,235
Indeed. 300 years ago,
when we investigated here,

92
00:11:07,275 --> 00:11:10,985
there weren't any guys such as these.

93
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:12,785
Dammit...

94
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:17,205
However, at that level,
there is no cause for worry.

95
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:21,205
There are still many Stages left,

96
00:11:21,245 --> 00:11:27,545
And if the worst comes to pass,
I am still here for you, am I not?

97
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:13,345
Recess, huh? I wonder what's goin' on.

98
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:17,015
Wh-What is it?

99
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:22,145
Wh-What's the matter, Chichi?

100
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:26,185
Where's Goten-<i>chan</i>?

101
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:30,565
What's happened to Goten-<i>chan</i>?!
Goten-<i>chan</i>'s gone off somewhere!

102
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:34,785
Huh? Now that you mention it,
we haven't seen him in a while, huh?

103
00:12:34,825 --> 00:12:38,205
Hmm, and Trunks as well.

104
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,205
Once the Junior Division was over,

105
00:12:40,245 --> 00:12:43,335
we'd agreed to watch the matches together.

106
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,795
You don't think the shock of
Trunks winnin' the final round

107
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:48,625
made him run off somewhere?

108
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:52,335
You thinkin' maybe he's gone home?

109
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:05,145
Say, Trunks-<i>kun...</i>

110
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:08,735
I'm getting thirsty, let's take a break!

111
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:10,655
Yeah, okay.

112
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:15,735
This is pretty tiring business, huh?
The two of us posing as one person.

113
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,695
That way! That way!

114
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:21,495
This way! This way!

115
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:33,545
Ah, right. I have to tell Contestant
Mighty Mask about this as well.

116
00:13:33,585 --> 00:13:35,465
This way! This way!

117
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:40,675
This way! This way!

118
00:13:44,805 --> 00:13:46,765
In here, in here!

119
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:53,445
All right, no one else is in here!

120
00:13:59,735 --> 00:14:01,615
There he is.

121
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:08,125
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, hurry and get down!

122
00:14:08,165 --> 00:14:10,545
Just a second!

123
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:13,135
Don't rush me!

124
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:16,135
Hm? Children's voices?

125
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:21,845
Right, right, pardon me!
Indeed, how bothersome...

126
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:24,595
Ah, I'm so busy, so busy!

127
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:27,565
Unbelievable, how everyone
litters like this! I declare!

128
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:31,605
Er, I'm in a bit of a hurry myself...

129
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:43,655
Yea! Juice, juice! Juice...

130
00:14:45,615 --> 00:14:49,835
Um... this one!

131
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,665
Of all the...

132
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:57,175
Contestant Mighty Mask!

133
00:15:10,145 --> 00:15:16,105
Huh? You two... Trunks-<i>kun</i>
and Goten-<i>kun</i>, isn't it?

134
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,695
Y-Yes!

135
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:21,535
Only participating contestants are
supposed to come in here, you know.

136
00:15:21,575 --> 00:15:26,705
Ah, um, we were hoping to
get Mister Satan's autograph.

137
00:15:26,745 --> 00:15:29,125
That's right! And juice.

138
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:31,745
Hmm, well, okay.

139
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:35,625
You two had such high marks
in the Junior Division, after all.

140
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:44,595
So, where's Contestant Mighty Mask?
I'm sure he came into this room.

141
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:52,185
Isn't this Contestant Mighty Mask's?

142
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:56,065
Where could he have gone?

143
00:15:56,105 --> 00:16:00,115
No, uh, I mean...

144
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:05,035
Mighty Mask-<i>san</i>?! Where are you?

145
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:15,085
Oh, he's in the shower?

146
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:19,505
Well then, Mighty Mask-<i>san</i>!

147
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,675
No! No, no!

148
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:24,675
He'll be very angry with
you if you peep in on him!

149
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:27,345
Mm? Ah, right!

150
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:31,355
Masked contestants hate having people
see their real face more than anything.

151
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:33,685
Gotcha, gotcha.

152
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:38,315
Well, Mighty Mask-<i>san</i>!

153
00:16:38,355 --> 00:16:40,855
Mighty-<i>san</i>!

154
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:44,115
Wh-What is it?

155
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:48,115
At last. We don't know for sure
when the Tournament will begin again,

156
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:50,035
so please don't go outside, okay?

157
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,875
Yeah, got it.

158
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,915
That'll do it.

159
00:16:57,505 --> 00:17:02,885
Now then, don't you two wander
around here too much, okay?

160
00:17:28,745 --> 00:17:31,915
Now it's my turn to fight.

161
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:35,295
So, I wonder what kind
of guy will be coming out.

162
00:17:35,335 --> 00:17:38,755
I sure hope he's impossibly strong!

163
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:47,965
Babidi-<i>sama</i>, which
warrior shall we send to Stage 2?

164
00:17:54,645 --> 00:17:56,065
I'll make it Yakon.

165
00:17:56,105 --> 00:18:02,445
Yakon! You're going to
use up Yakon on Stage 2?!

166
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:06,525
We must not take these
earthlings too lightly, I think.

167
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:12,785
See how Puipui inflicted
absolutely no damage at all on them?

168
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,035
I see. However, with Yakon as their opponent,

169
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,455
they will all be defeated at once,

170
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,875
and there will be
nothing left for me to enjoy.

171
00:18:21,915 --> 00:18:25,045
Shouldn't your first priority right
now be that of awakening Majin Boo

172
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:28,675
from his long sleep,
rather than enjoying yourself?

173
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:33,015
Y-Yes! My humble apologies!

174
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:36,975
Stage 2 is Yakon! Relay that!

175
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:47,275
Yakon-<i>sama</i>!

176
00:19:21,515 --> 00:19:24,065
Yakon!

177
00:19:26,485 --> 00:19:30,485
Sorry to keep you waiting
so long! It's your turn now.

178
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:33,035
Fight to your heart's content!

179
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:36,995
Yes, Babidi-<i>sama...</i>

180
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:45,045
Hey! Ready yet? Hurry up and come on out!

181
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:46,045
This is senseless!

182
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:49,465
Why don't we knock our way through
the floor and head down there all at once?

183
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,675
You must not!

184
00:19:50,715 --> 00:19:53,885
As I said before, if we
provide any strong shock,

185
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:57,145
then even if he's not at
full power, Majin Boo might...

186
00:19:57,185 --> 00:20:02,725
Hmph, at this rate, how do we know
that Majin Boo isn't all that great either?

187
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:05,985
The same way that Dabura scum isn't.

188
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:09,985
Dabura isn't all that great?
How do you mean?

189
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:13,995
I'm saying that Dabura doesn't
seem to be the fearsome scumbag

190
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:18,115
you guys make him out to be.

191
00:20:18,155 --> 00:20:21,785
Based on what we saw of
his attacks outside earlier,

192
00:20:21,825 --> 00:20:25,125
as long as we're careful of his
saliva, we could have taken him.

193
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:29,215
There's no way to explain Kibit being
beaten, except that he bungled it.

194
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:33,425
I-Is this true, Goku-<i>san</i>?

195
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:36,975
Mm-hmm. Well, even supposing
that wasn't his full power,

196
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:40,895
a little while ago, we would
have thought him a terrifying foe.

197
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:43,975
Seven years ago, there
was this guy named Cell.

198
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:47,735
He probably has the same strength as him.

199
00:20:47,775 --> 00:20:54,365
<i>I-I can't believe it. Is this Super</i>
<i>Saiyan thing really that strong?</i>

200
00:20:54,405 --> 00:20:56,075
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

201
00:20:56,115 --> 00:20:59,205
<i>it was considerably difficult to</i>
<i>contain Gohan-san's movement</i>

202
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:02,585
<i>when he had turned Super Saiyan...</i>

203
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:07,295
<i>Was even that still not their full power?</i>

204
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:13,505
Hey! Hurry it up, already!
This time it's my turn, you know!

205
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,535
What do we have here?

206
00:21:55,175 --> 00:22:00,265
Yakon! Be sure to put away all
three of them this time for me!

207
00:22:08,105 --> 00:22:10,225
Th-This is...!

208
00:22:13,695 --> 00:22:17,035
<i>The demonic beast, Yakon,</i>
<i>appears at the second Stage.</i>

209
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:22,455
<i>So, we will now able to see</i>
<i>Son Goku fight after such a long time!</i>

210
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:25,365
<i>Stay sharp, Goku!</i>

211
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:39,055
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

212
00:22:40,765 --> 00:22:45,595
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

213
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:56,195
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

214
00:22:56,235 --> 00:23:02,285
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

215
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:09,295
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

216
00:23:09,335 --> 00:23:14,665
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

217
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:18,545
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

218
00:23:18,585 --> 00:23:27,605
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

219
00:23:27,645 --> 00:23:29,145
<i>Even now?</i>

220
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:36,775
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

221
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:42,195
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

222
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:48,665
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

223
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:58,715
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

224
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,895
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

225
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:18,735
<i>Heh-heh, I ain't fought in the</i>
<i>Lower Realm in a long time, huh?</i>

226
00:24:18,775 --> 00:24:22,905
<i>Hu-uh? I went from</i>
<i>Super Saiyan back to normal!</i>

227
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:26,035
<i>The demonic beast Yakon</i>
<i>devoured your light energy!</i>

228
00:24:26,075 --> 00:24:28,665
<i>However strong you may be,</i>
<i>Goku-san, you can't take him alone!</i>

229
00:24:28,705 --> 00:24:30,745
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

230
00:24:30,785 --> 00:24:34,045
<i>"Goku's Power Wide Open!!</i>
<i>Blow Away Yakon."</i>

231
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:37,215
<i>Incredible! Father's ki just surged!</i>

232
00:24:37,255 --> 00:24:39,795
"Next time"
"Goku's Power Wide Open!!
Blow Away Yakon"
