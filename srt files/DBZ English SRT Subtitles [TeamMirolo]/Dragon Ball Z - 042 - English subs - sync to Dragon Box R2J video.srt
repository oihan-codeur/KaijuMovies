<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

Yow-ow-ow-ow!

22
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:46,545
Okay, let's find the remaining
Dragon Balls quickly, and go back to Earth!

23
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:50,925
Saying "do it quickly" is one thing,
but as spread-out as this place is...

24
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,595
We'll find them for sure, you'll see.

25
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:59,225
Thank you very much, Zarkuro<i>-san.</i>

26
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,425
Come to mention it,
where is Lychee<i>-san</i> today?

27
00:05:01,465 --> 00:05:05,465
He said he was staying home
because he had some work to do.

28
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:10,445
That's strange. One of the
Dragon Balls is moving toward us rapidly.

29
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,425
What is that?

30
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:37,035
What are you doing?!
The Dragon Ball is inside that thing!

31
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:54,245
Hurry up and go get the Dragon Ball!

32
00:05:54,285 --> 00:05:58,485
Y-You can't mean that. Let's
just wait until the tornado disperses.

33
00:05:59,995 --> 00:06:02,355
That tornado isn't going to disperse.

34
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:06,695
On this planet, tornados
roam around the desert forever.

35
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:18,705
Snap to it. I'm going
to be taking shelter, okay?

36
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,975
What are you doing?!

37
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:27,145
Hurry up!

38
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:29,385
A-All right.

39
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:31,985
Gohan, we're going to
release our <i>ki</i> toward that thing.

40
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,385
Right.

41
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:34,725
All right...

42
00:06:40,435 --> 00:06:42,365
<i>Kienzan!</i>

43
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:45,165
<i>Masenko!</i>

44
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:50,875
Stop that! If you do that, you're
going to destroy the Dragon Ball!

45
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:52,705
B-But...

46
00:06:56,345 --> 00:06:59,685
What are you doing?! Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy!

47
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:04,255
Stay away! Stay away! Stay away!

48
00:07:10,365 --> 00:07:14,635
This is why I said I didn't
want to come to Planet Namek!

49
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:21,295
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

50
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,705
This is why I said I couldn't
go from the start, you know!

51
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:30,275
There's no way a delicate young lady
like myself can go looking for Dragon Balls!

52
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,045
You're not serious!

53
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:38,445
<i>Without that Dragon Ball,</i>
<i>Piccolo-san won't be coming back to life.</i>

54
00:07:59,675 --> 00:08:00,905
<i>There it is!</i>

55
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,615
I did it!

56
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,615
All right...

57
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:13,955
<i>Masenko!</i>

58
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:22,795
Gohan!

59
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,235
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

60
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,235
I got it out.

61
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:27,635
You did it!

62
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:32,375
Yahoo! That makes four of them! You did it!

63
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:53,735
Sure enough, this is the best outfit for me!

64
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:09,305
This one is that way, no doubt about it.

65
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:27,165
It sure is dark. I can't see a thing.

66
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:30,105
Shall I make us a torch?

67
00:09:38,175 --> 00:09:41,515
W-What was that just now?

68
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:50,975
This isn't a forest, it's a bird!

69
00:10:58,595 --> 00:11:01,425
Aah! Help!

70
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,805
Look at that incredible castle!

71
00:11:41,235 --> 00:11:42,965
We've got no choice but to jump off!

72
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:45,135
It does look like that's
the only thing we can do.

73
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:47,535
Y-You're kidding, right?!

74
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:51,015
If we don't act fast, we're
going to become bird food.

75
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:03,145
All right! All right, already. But you
guys are responsible for catching me!

76
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:04,855
We know.

77
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:18,055
Remember this well, you trash...
There aren't going to be any more miracles...

78
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:21,155
Be sure to enjoy yourselves until then...

79
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:41,445
I can't beat that Saiyan like this.

80
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:32,035
Say, the Dragon Ball is right nearby.

81
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,895
Okay, Bulma<i>-san</i>, you
keep a lookout, if you please.

82
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,675
I-It'll be okay, right?
He's sound asleep, after all.

83
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:20,815
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, have you found it?

84
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:24,355
No, not yet. What about you, Zarkuro<i>-san</i>?

85
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:26,915
I haven't found it.

86
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:38,095
Geez, where exactly have you hidden it?

87
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:11,735
There it is!

88
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:19,435
Here goes.

89
00:16:19,475 --> 00:16:27,015
Ready, set...

90
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:47,595
Safe!

91
00:16:49,205 --> 00:16:52,445
Okay, let's get back, quickly.

92
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:06,915
I've looked everywhere I can think of,
but I have absolutely no idea where he went.

93
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:11,355
Good grief! My darlin' Gohan<i>-chan</i>
is off strugglin' hard on a distant planet,

94
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:15,165
and what is his father, Goku<i>-sa</i>, doin'?!
He never does anythin' a parent should!

95
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:18,765
N-Now, now, Chichi, you
don't need to get so worked up...

96
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:23,165
Goku must have felt terrible that he
couldn't do anything, all here on his own.

97
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:28,345
No, he's not gettin' away with it!
Makin' others worry about him like this...

98
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:32,875
If he doesn't get back here soon,
I'm goin' to turn this sweater into hankies!

99
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:40,355
You won't get away from me!

100
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:43,795
Bulma<i>-san</i>, are you sure this toy can fly?

101
00:17:43,835 --> 00:17:48,165
You just hush! If I say
it will fly, then it will fly!

102
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,695
I told you, we should
have run away down the stairs.

103
00:17:52,735 --> 00:17:57,175
Stop all of your complaining and
do something about that guy, now!

104
00:17:58,715 --> 00:18:00,805
I guess we've got no choice.

105
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:02,675
–All right, Gohan, let's go!
–Right!

106
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,245
Hold it, hold it, hold it!

107
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:27,105
Oh, man! Enough, already!

108
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:37,545
I did it! I really am a
mechanical genius! Amazing!

109
00:18:37,585 --> 00:18:39,275
<i>Kienzan!</i>

110
00:18:44,555 --> 00:18:46,425
<i>Masenko!</i>

111
00:18:49,065 --> 00:18:50,895
We got him!

112
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,615
We're saved!

113
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:20,585
For goodness' sake, you guys
are nothing but trouble for me!

114
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:25,155
If I weren't around, we wouldn't have
gotten a single Dragon Ball. You're hopeless.

115
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:27,325
You don't say...

116
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,135
Now there's only two left.

117
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:40,605
At this rate, we should be able
to go back to Earth soon, huh?

118
00:19:40,645 --> 00:19:42,545
That would be nice...

119
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:48,475
Huh?!

120
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,115
It's almost time...

121
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,885
All right.

122
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:52,935
You are now healed. You may open your eyes.

123
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:07,725
Unfortunately, we were not
able to regenerate your tail.

124
00:22:07,765 --> 00:22:10,255
No matter. It will grow back in time.

125
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:26,635
<i>Vegeta has recovered at last. The</i>
<i>fearsome battle is about to begin again.</i>

126

<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

130

<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:43,645
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

139
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:45,815
<i>So sorry.</i>

140
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:50,925
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

145
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,915
<i>Whew, we're just about</i>
<i>ready to come back to Earth!</i>

146
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:21,425
<i>Then I can put some makeup on,</i>

147

<i>and go back to being the</i>
