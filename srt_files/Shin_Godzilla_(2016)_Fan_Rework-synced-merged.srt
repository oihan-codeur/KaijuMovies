We believe it to be magma steam.

100

A new undersea volcanic eruption.

101
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,756
Excuse me, Minister Yanagihara.

102
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:42,302
The epicenter is shallow and appears to be just steam.

103
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:45,556
We're confident it's not volcanic activity.

104
00:04:45,556 --> 00:04:47,933
Really? Then tell me sooner.

105
00:04:48,892 --> 00:04:51,895
A new, large hydrothermal vent?

106
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,331
That must be it.

107
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:55,816
A vent directly above the tunnel?

108
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:58,754
Past geological surveys rule that out.

A colossal creature. There's even footage online.

116

Preposterous. A big whale spouting?

117
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:17,273

Azuma, Chief Cabinet Secretary
Time is a wasting. How about a process of elimination?

123
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:32,438
Right. A new volcano or a large thermal vent.

124
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:33,855
What else could it be?

125
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:36,608
Then let's plan our basic response.

126
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:40,530
Can we hold a cabinet meeting, Mr. Prime Minister?

127
00:05:40,863 --> 00:05:42,948
Of course.

128

Let's move to the main conference room.

129

Yaguchi.

130
00:05:57,005 --> 00:06:00,175
You'll have to toe the line on their decision.

131
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:02,302
Don't stir things up.

132
00:06:02,302 --> 00:06:04,905
Shouldn't we consider every possibility?

is absent on a trip to Australia.
They stand ready to respond.

142
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,709
Regarding to Tokyo Bay coastal region...

143
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,837
...we're at evacuation preparedness level.

144
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:38,048
Due to possible debris and ash,

145
00:06:38,048 --> 00:06:43,469
we're grounding all flights out of Haneda until further notice.

146
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,601
Forgive me. Correction.

147
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:54,982
The grounding of all flights out of Haneda

148
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:59,546
is unavoidable to ensure citizen safety over economic concerns...

149
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,947
Later

150
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:05,367
As for the undersea volcano-induced tunnel flooding.

151
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:09,539
fortunately, no toxic gasses have been detected.

152

Teams from the Archaeological Agency and the Coast Guard

153
00:07:14,878 --> 00:07:19,299
are en route to conduct a thorough investigation of the cause.

154
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:28,016
Eruption activity is reportedly dying down rapidly.

155
00:07:34,982 --> 00:07:36,275
Is it over?

156
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,277
No big deal, I guess.

157
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:40,863
Mr. Prime Minister. I beg to reiterate...

158
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:44,867
...the presence of a large marine creature...

159
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:46,744
...as a possible cause.

160
00:07:46,744 --> 00:07:49,664
Yaguchi. This is no place for jokes.

161
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:52,458
This is a ministerial meeting. Minutes are kept.

162
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:53,876
Don't make mockery of it.

163
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,390
With no time frame for restoration,

164
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,436
we can expect those losses to swell.

165
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,104
Sorry! We must suspend this meeting.

166
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:15,107
The television. Turn on the TV!

167
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:19,654
It's unbelievable!

168
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:23,657
I've never seen anything like it.

169
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:26,827
What was that?

170
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:27,871
A tail?

171
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,056
Yes, It's a tail.

172
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,125
Yaguchi's joke may be a serious thing.

173
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:35,341
Let us adjourn this meeting.

174
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:39,281
All ministers, assemble in the Prime Minister's office.

175
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,430
So what the hell is it?

176
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:50,811
For now, we only have "Giant Unidentified Creature."

177
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:55,232
We're making a list of biologists and scholars

178
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:57,943
from universities and research organizations.

179
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:00,695
We'll hold an emergency summit

180
00:09:00,695 --> 00:09:02,657
to figure this thing out.

181
00:09:02,782 --> 00:09:04,867
Make haste. We need to know.

182
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:05,326
Yes!

183
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:06,577
Mr. Prime Minister.

184
00:09:06,785 --> 00:09:10,748
Perhaps we should focus on our response.

185
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,083
Yes, of course.

186
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:15,044
Yes, but this is unprecedented.

187
00:09:15,044 --> 00:09:17,839
I think the choices are simple.

188
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,882
Do nothing. Let it go.

189
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:23,863
Or capture it, exterminate it, or just chase it off.

190
00:09:23,887 --> 00:09:23,929
Kabira, Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs
.

191
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:25,848
Kabira, Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs
I vote for extermination.

192
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:26,849
I concur.

193
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:28,141
Hayama, Secretary of Economic Industry
,

194
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:30,936
Hayama, Secretary of Economic Industry
Look at the costs incurred already,

195
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:32,562
with the tunnel,

196
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:37,443
the grounding of flights and indefinite closing of Tokyo Bay.

197
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,903
I, too, favor extermination.

198
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:43,532
The sooner, the better. Right, Defense Ministry?

199
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:47,244
Matsumoto, Supervisor of Defensive Operational Policy
,

200
00:09:47,244 --> 00:09:50,623
Matsumoto, Supervisor of Defensive Operational Policy
We've prepared for a wildlife-based threat before.

201
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:55,294
But never with Self-Defense Forces using weapons in Tokyo Bay.

202
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:58,965
Why blow it up? Can't we just chase it off?

203
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,677
Academic circles and environmentalists

204
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:06,222
are already calling for it's live capture

205
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:08,850
as a valuable new species.

206
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,396
No, extermination's the answer. A few torpedoes?

207
00:10:12,396 --> 00:10:17,192
The use of weapons requires careful examination of options.

208
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:21,905
I, too, side strongly with the option of live capture.

209
00:10:22,115 --> 00:10:25,868
Start gathering intel on the unidentified creature quickly.

210
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:28,363
Extermination, capture and expulsion.

211
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:32,677
Hiraoka, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
,

212
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:34,177
Hiraoka, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
Who are you addressing?

213
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:42,260
Vapor cloud spotted near the Tama River!

214
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,596
It's moving?

215
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:45,888
It's alive, isn't it?

216
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:46,932
Tama River mouth, Tokyo Bay
,

217
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:50,561
Tama River mouth, Tokyo Bay
The creature's off Haneda Airport Runway D,

218
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:52,396
entering the Tama River!

219
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:57,442
Report of flooding on the Bayshore Expressway.

220
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:58,736
Not again!

221
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:00,338
Forget capturing it.

222
00:11:00,362 --> 00:11:00,403
Anzai, Prime Minister's Secretary of Internal Affairs
,

223
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:04,700
Anzai, Prime Minister's Secretary of Internal Affairs
Sir. Biologists are starting to arrive. Only three so far, but...

224
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,892
Fifth Floor Reception Room
.

225
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:15,687
Emergency Academic Conference regarding Giant Unidentified Creature
.

226
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:15,795
Dr. Shiga, paleontologist
,

227
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:18,256
Dr. Shiga, paleontologist
It's indiscernible from TV images

228
00:11:18,256 --> 00:11:21,026
whether it's some dinosaur relic

229
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,428
or a species of whale.

230
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:25,013
Dr. Yanagi, marine biologist
,

231
00:11:25,013 --> 00:11:29,226
Dr. Yanagi, marine biologist
It seems to be a never-before seen aquatic species.

232
00:11:29,226 --> 00:11:32,646
But I can't say without an examination.

233
00:11:33,814 --> 00:11:34,064
Dr. Hanawa, biologist
.

234
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:38,277
Dr. Hanawa, biologist
First is whether the footage is real.

235
00:11:38,777 --> 00:11:42,465
If I were to rush to judgment based on unverified evidence...

236
00:11:42,489 --> 00:11:45,493
...I'd lose credibility as a biologist.

237
00:11:47,786 --> 00:11:50,456
The conference is wrapping up.

238
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:50,998
Fifth Floor Secretary's office
.

239
00:11:50,998 --> 00:11:53,042
Fifth Floor Secretary's office
This is ludicrous.

240
00:11:56,754 --> 00:11:59,715
Asahi Bridge on the Nomi River, Ota Ward
.

241
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:16,483
What a waste of time that was.

242
00:12:16,483 --> 00:12:17,192
I agree.

243
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:20,654
Damn their status. Get me someone who knows something.

244
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:21,697
Yes, Sir.

245
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:28,179
Shimura, any ideas?

246
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:30,477
A smart Environment Ministry friend

247
00:12:30,502 --> 00:12:32,750
from college, but she's low ranking.

248
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,501
Fine. Call her.

249
00:12:42,552 --> 00:12:42,760
Hiromi Ogashira, Ministry of the Environment Deputy Chief, Wildlife Division
,

250
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,514
Hiromi Ogashira, Ministry of the Environment Deputy Chief, Wildlife Division
Serpentine with auxiliary ambulation.

251
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:50,852
Gills make it aquatic, but has legs like a lungfish.

252
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:54,606
If it has legs, can it come on land?

253
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,859
Yes. It's a possibility.

254
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,152
Really? What then?

255
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:03,699
Frankly, we haven't determined which agency it falls under

256
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:07,077
Our scholar says that fin-like feet...

257
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,498
would be crushed under the creature's weight.

258
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,667
So coming ashore is physiologically impossible.

259
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,754
It's already supporting its weight.

260
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,898
Is that so?

261
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,799
What's your view, Environment Minister?

262
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:21,217
Kikugawa, Minister of the Environment
,

263
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,679
Kikugawa, Minister of the Environment
Forgive the deputy chief's poor decorum.

264
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:30,018
But as your experts concluded, coming on land is very improbable.

265
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:30,769
I see.

266
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,856
Sir, considering the damage wreaked thus far...

267
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:40,654
the sooner we hold a press conference to calm the public, the better.

268
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,740
But Sir, If I may.

269
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,660
Please take care to give only verified information.

270
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,037
Understood.

271
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,331
Prepare my uniform.

272
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,633
New Nomi Bridge, Nomi River, Ota Ward

274
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:17,817
First Floor Press Conference Room
The Aqua-Line and Tama River have sustained significant damage.

275
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:21,696
The creature is currently moving up the Nomi River.

276
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:25,659
We're yet to identify what sort of creature it is.

277
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:28,162
But we don't expect it to come on land.

278
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:31,874
Should it beach itself in the shallows...

279
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:36,462
we believe it would be crushed to death under it's own weight.

280
00:14:36,796 --> 00:14:37,838
I repeat.

281
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,549
There is no danger of the creature coming ashore.

282
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:44,053
Please set your minds at ease.

283
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,889
Sir, excuse the interruption.

284
00:14:48,933 --> 00:14:50,685
It has?

285
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:54,064
Kamata, Ota Ward
.

286
00:14:58,402 --> 00:15:00,404
Hurry! Hurry! Run away!

287
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:10,014
No danger of coming ashore, huh?

288
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:10,163
Underground Access Hallway
,

289
00:15:10,163 --> 00:15:13,209
Underground Access Hallway
Now what? I've just been proven a liar!

290
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,129
You weren't supposed to go off script!

291
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:19,924
I needed to reassure the public clearly.

292
00:15:19,924 --> 00:15:23,803
We're asking the experts how it came ashore.

293
00:15:23,803 --> 00:15:26,139
Screw them. What's happening out there?

294
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:51,665
Sir, we need to set up an emergency disaster control headquarters.

295
00:15:52,082 --> 00:15:52,666
Understood.

296
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:52,833
Conference regarding Emergency Disaster Control for Giant Unidentified Creature
,

297
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:56,045
Conference regarding Emergency Disaster Control for Giant Unidentified Creature
This cabinet council is now adjourned.

298
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:58,005
Let's get to work.

299
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:00,132
Fourth Floor Hallway
,

300
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:02,176
Fourth Floor Hallway
So much red tape.

301
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:04,136
Every action requires a meeting.

302
00:16:04,136 --> 00:16:07,598
That's the foundation of democracy.

303
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:10,018
Even to hold a press conference?

304
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:15,648
We have set up emergency disaster control headquarters.

305
00:16:15,648 --> 00:16:19,694
to combat the large unidentified creature that has come ashore.

306
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:25,075
We are crafting a full-scale response to secure citizen safety,

307
00:16:25,075 --> 00:16:27,995
including coordinated evacuation

308
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:32,124
with Tokyo federal government agencies...

309
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:43,385
The creature's heading toward Shinagawa.

310
00:16:43,385 --> 00:16:46,031
At a speed of about 13 km per hour.

311
00:16:46,055 --> 00:16:48,724
It moves slowly for it's size.

312
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:51,686
It can trample through Tokyo in 3 hours.

313
00:16:51,686 --> 00:16:54,188
The city is dense and brittle.

314
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:57,066
We're looking at enormous damage.

315
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,985
We must exterminate it now!

316
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:03,323
It's a densely-populated area. We must evacuate people first.

317
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:07,720
Have MIC and MILT set up evacuation zones and transport.

318
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:10,140
Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building
.

319
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:10,414
Disaster Control HQ, Ninth Floor
,

320
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:14,752
Disaster Control HQ, Ninth Floor
We've got orders from the PM to conduct evacuation measures.

321
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:15,044
Kozuka, Governor of Tokyo
,

322
00:17:15,044 --> 00:17:17,046
Kozuka, Governor of Tokyo
What took so long?

323
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:20,716
Nothing in the first response manual applies here.

324
00:17:20,716 --> 00:17:24,762
Just expedite an evacuation plan on the fly.

325
00:17:24,762 --> 00:17:27,890
We've never drilled for this kind of thing.

326
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:28,015
Tahara, Vice Governor
,

327
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:31,062
Tahara, Vice Governor
A city-wide evacuation will cause a general panic.

328
00:17:31,062 --> 00:17:32,103
Citizens will have to self-evacuate.

329
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:32,395
Kawamata, Vice Governor
,

330
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:35,648
Kawamata, Vice Governor
We'll make every effort to control traffic.

331
00:17:35,648 --> 00:17:35,773
Onchi, Superintendent General
,

332
00:17:35,774 --> 00:17:38,796
Onchi, Superintendent General
They must leave their vehicles quickly and obey signage and police.

333
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:39,193
Highway Fifteen, Shinagawa Ward
,

334
00:17:39,193 --> 00:17:41,363
Highway Fifteen, Shinagawa Ward
Traffic signs are out of order.

335
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:46,118
Please leave your vehicles and follow police guidance.

336
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:51,915
The Tokyo Government has ordered a full evacuation of Shinagawa.

337
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:57,713
All residents are required to evacuate immediately.

338
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:19,069
Hurry dear!

339
00:18:37,379 --> 00:18:39,799
At this rate, the city will be in ruins

340
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:42,593
Contact the Public Safety Commission.

341
00:18:42,593 --> 00:18:48,141
We can request Self Defense Forces for pest extermination.

342
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:50,059
And use of weapons?

343
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:53,145
Interpreted as an armed attack under Article 76...

344
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:55,398
Self-defense troops can use force.

345
00:18:55,398 --> 00:18:57,650
This doesn't qualify as an armed attack.

346
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:03,966
Article 76 stipulates "by an aggressor country or equivalent."

347
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,576
It's no time for semantics.

348
00:19:06,576 --> 00:19:08,912
Only the SDF is equipped to respond.

349
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:12,374
That means soldiers engaging in urban combat.

350
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:15,002
That will give the Prime Minister pause.

351
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,591
We need an integrated response that involves both...

352
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:23,302
military force and civilian evacuation.

353
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,930
Declare a state of emergency.

354
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,599
Right now, our only extralegal measure

355
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:31,227
is mobilization for defense.

356
00:19:31,477 --> 00:19:34,147
Only the Prime Minister can decide that.

357
00:19:34,648 --> 00:19:36,190
You're talking...

358
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:39,319
a declaration with no precedent.

359
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:43,114
We'd be mobilizing the country for war.

360
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:47,494
The police can't handle an evacuation of this size.

361
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:49,371
But if we mobilize...

362
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:53,333
there is a likelihood of collateral damage.

363
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,770
I don't want that.

364
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:59,548
Can we get the US to kill this beast under the Security Treaty?

365
00:19:59,548 --> 00:20:03,177
No. Our government and SDF must move first.

366
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,949
Even under the Treaty, the US can only provide support.

367
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:09,099
We're facing a living organism.

368
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:12,937
Aggravating it might only lead to more damage.

369
00:20:12,937 --> 00:20:14,772
Yes, it's an organism.

370
00:20:14,772 --> 00:20:17,734
That means we can stop it.

371
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:21,153
Unlike an earthquake or a typhoon.

372
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,074
Protecting citizens is our top priority.

373
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:28,912
It's a tough decision, Sir, but to prevent further calamity...

374
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:31,457
...your authorization is needed.

375
00:20:31,582 --> 00:20:33,082
Right this instant?

376
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:34,834
Are you serious?

377
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:37,087
Time is precious. Your decision.

378
00:20:37,212 --> 00:20:40,257
Moments ago, the Prime Minister...

379
00:20:40,257 --> 00:20:43,177
declared a national state of emergency...

380
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:48,349
calling for the first ever mobilization of the Self Defense Forces.

381
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:52,395
And the first post-war military action since World War II

382
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:58,067
As an emergency "pest extermination", the order preempts direct approval.

Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building A (Ministry of Defense)
,

384

They're tasked with guiding rescue and evacuation efforts.

387
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,578
But they're not equipped for battle.

00:21:08,578 --> 00:21:08,871
Atsushi, Chief of the Ground Staff
,

389
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:12,207
Atsushi, Chief of the Ground Staff
Attack helicopters are the most expedient.

390
00:21:12,207 --> 00:21:14,000
Contact Kisarazu base.

391
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,125
Ozawa, Chief of the Air Staff
,

392
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,212
Ozawa, Chief of the Air Staff
Shall we deploy F-2's from Misawa?

393
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:16,503
,
No. Any civilian casualties could destroy the SDF forever.

394
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:20,466
Hamada, Joint Staff Commander
No. Any civilian casualties could destroy the SDF forever.

395
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,154
Let's minimize firepower.

396
00:21:22,217 --> 00:21:22,279
Kitano, Chief of the Maritime Staff
,

397
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,224
Kitano, Chief of the Maritime Staff
But we don't know its strength.

398
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:27,116
I think we need to be ready.

399
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:27,181
Yajima, Joint Staff Deputy General
,

400
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:32,019
Yajima, Joint Staff Deputy General
I agree. Let's recommend an integrated, 3 force operation.

401
00:21:32,228 --> 00:21:33,437
Call the PM.

402
00:21:34,856 --> 00:21:36,909
The joint force will be lead by the Eastern Army.

403
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,496
The goal, extermination.

404
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,718
With ground troops focused on evacuation...

405
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:40,861
Zaizen, Joint Staff General
,

406
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:48,357
Zaizen, Joint Staff General
Rapid response helicopters will be our primary attack force.

407
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:54,209
Sir, as it's in the city, some elderly and infirm may remain.

408
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:57,713
That's why I can't make a decision without an inspection.

409
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:02,843
Under such conditions, a little collateral damage is unavoidable.

410
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,681
Sir, it's not easy.

411
00:22:07,348 --> 00:22:09,350
But we need a decision.

412
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:12,103
Understood.

414
00:22:16,232 --> 00:22:20,587
This is a risky, unplanned mission. Call for volunteers?

415
00:22:20,611 --> 00:22:24,866
No, standard rotation. This is what we signed up for.

What a relief. The creature may be big,

421
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:43,135
but this ought to do the trick.

422
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,306
Maybe we can rebuild the town with it's carcass.

423
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:48,808
Minister Yanagihara.

424
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:52,060
Wishful thinking and armchair theories

425
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:55,398
by the old Imperial Army in the last war

426
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:58,126
led to 3 million Japanese lives lost.

427
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,337
Beware of unfounded optimism.

Please watch your step. Remain calm.

430

Get away from here quickly!

431
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:22,009
Local evacuation centers are useless.

432
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:24,970
Tell us where to send people!

433
00:23:47,702 --> 00:23:51,289
The creature's progression has stopped!

434
00:23:51,623 --> 00:23:52,541
Stopped?

435
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,167
Why all of sudden?

436
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:26,033
Incredible.

437
00:24:28,745 --> 00:24:29,912

CP, this is Attacker 1. Target differs from report.

449
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:49,412
Attacker 1, hold your position. Await instructions.

450

Resident evacuation is complete.

451
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,083
Understood.

452
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:57,087
Minister, we're ready to open fire.

453
00:25:57,087 --> 00:25:58,380
Understood.

454

Mr. Prime Minister. On your command.

455
00:26:03,134 --> 00:26:05,887
Very well. Go ahead.

456
00:26:06,138 --> 00:26:09,767
Attacker 1, commence fire on the creature.

457
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:13,455
I repeat, commence fire.

Distance 300. Ready, aim...

461
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:23,781
Hold your fire!

Can we proceed with firing?

474
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:56,482
Mr. Prime Minister!

475
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,610
Abort. Abort the attack!

476
00:26:59,943 --> 00:27:02,781

Breaking through the expressway, is headed towards Tokyo Bay

482
00:27:47,785 --> 00:27:49,787

Scientist envoys from France and other nations have arrived.

490

The creature has not been spotted in the Uraga Channel.

491
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:19,401
So the search zone is expanding.

492
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:23,197
The casualty count is up to 100 as a result of...

493
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:25,699
Fires in Ota Ward have been put out.

No.

500
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:50,600
We had as long as 2 hours to mount an initial response. Disappointing.

501
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:53,353
It was a surprise. Can't be helped.

502
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:58,025
Everyone did their best in the circumstances.

503

and patrols around Chiba and Sagami Bay.

513

The metro area has to take priority.

528
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,461
Looks like a 5th floor order.

529
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,315
What about the regions?

530
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:44,511
13 million people, GNP of 85 trillion yen.

531
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,763
That's 17% of the total.

532
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:50,892
And in the Kanto region? 40% and 200 trillion.

533
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:55,481
Seems like a prudent strategy to me.

534
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:58,626
Protecting a country isn't easy.

I'll round up people who'll speak their mind to the PM

544
00:31:17,753 --> 00:31:19,881
Yeah. People with balls.

545
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:21,233
I'm Tachikawa.

I'm Rando Yaguchi. We'll operate as a flat organization.

00:31:42,112 --> 00:31:44,657
Forget about titles and seniority.

552
00:31:44,657 --> 00:31:46,158
Speak freely here.

553

That's it.

554
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:51,705
I'm nominally in charge, but we're a crack team of...

555
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:53,750
lone wolves, nerds...

556
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,167
troublemakers, outcasts...

557
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,337
academic heretics and general pains-in-the-bureaucracy.

558
00:31:57,462 --> 00:31:58,689

Here are the basic specs.

561
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:02,759
Find out what you can.

562
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:10,142
Is this all?

563
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:13,103
Yup. We have to fill in the blanks.

564
00:32:13,228 --> 00:32:15,522
If you have info, please share it.

565
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:17,733
Yesterday's "council of experts"...

566
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,754

I put together a simple profile.

569
00:32:24,281 --> 00:32:26,576
It's shown us 3 configurations.

570
00:32:26,576 --> 00:32:28,261
More mutations coming.

571
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:29,745
There's more?

We're analyzing a sample of its body fluid at our lab.

574
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:37,503
Pass some to me. I'll get outside help.

575
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:40,816
The US took all the remaining samples.

Under American pressure, I hear.

580
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:49,683
Then we leave the analysis to you.

581
00:32:50,183 --> 00:32:52,602
And from Behavioral Biology?

582
00:32:52,727 --> 00:32:55,939
Behaviorally, it just seems to move.

583
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:57,482
Can't determine intellect.

584
00:32:57,607 --> 00:33:01,087
I think communication with it is unlikely.

Tachikawa, Director of Nuclear Power

586
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:04,948
Tachikawa, Director of Nuclear Power
Simple question. What's its energy source?

587
00:33:05,074 --> 00:33:07,994
It needs an enormous amount of energy.

588
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:11,205
Not just to move, but metabolically.

589
00:33:11,205 --> 00:33:15,727
Oxygen conversion in its digestive tract wouldn't be enough.

590
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:17,378
All that energy.

591
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:22,425
Nuclear fission?

592
00:33:24,427 --> 00:33:26,304
Sense of humor, Ms. Ogashira?

593
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:28,783
That's impossible.

594
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,768
Yokosuka Bay, Kanagawa Prefecture
.

595
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,645
A US carrier is leaving port?

596
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:39,359
We heard that Yokosuka City's radiation monitoring alarm went off.

597
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:42,338
I'll check with the Nuclear Regulation Authority.

599

Monitoring Department, Nuclear Regulation Authority, Minato Ward
I have orders not to go public yet.

600
00:33:45,449 --> 00:33:48,995
But radiation levels in the metro area have risen.

601
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:52,265
Like a leak somewhere? A reactor?

602
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:52,665
Negishi, Nuclear Regulatory Authority Monitoring Manager
,

603
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:57,128
Negishi, Nuclear Regulatory Authority Monitoring Manager
We've not found a leak at any of the nation's reactors.

604
00:33:57,128 --> 00:33:58,754
Then where's it coming from?

605
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,970
Is that possible?

606
00:34:09,557 --> 00:34:13,394
This data shows radiation spikes matching the creatures path.

607
00:34:16,982 --> 00:34:17,857
Look here.

608
00:34:19,818 --> 00:34:20,402
See?

609
00:34:24,364 --> 00:34:26,742
Miss Ogashira was right.

610
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:29,328
Sorry.

611
00:34:30,163 --> 00:34:32,206
"Why's the radiation meter reacting?"

612
00:34:39,339 --> 00:34:42,092
This information is already spreading publicly.

613
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:45,655
Contact the Chief Secretary Cabinet.

Chief Cabinet Secretary's office, Fifth Floor, Prime Minister's Office

615
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:50,118
This is trouble.

616
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:53,061
The PM needs to call a press conference.

Morito, Secretary to the Chief Cabinet Secretary

Morito, Secretary to the Chief Cabinet Secretary
Without proof it's radioactive,

619
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,985
we might end up stoking public fear unnecessarily.

620
00:34:59,985 --> 00:35:02,779
It's not enough of a spike to warrant evacuation.

621
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:05,825
There are no legal grounds to it.

622
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:08,827
It's still a matter of radioactivity.

623
00:35:09,244 --> 00:35:10,371
The sooner, the better.

624
00:35:10,621 --> 00:35:13,124
That's right. I'll meet the press.

625
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:15,126
Let me talk to the PM.

626
00:35:16,794 --> 00:35:20,590
Schedule a Prime Minister's briefing. Five minutes.

00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:20,673
Japan-US heads of state conference call

628

Japan-US heads of state conference call
Yes, President Ross, I understand. Thank you.

629
00:35:28,472 --> 00:35:30,850
A lot of unilateral demands.

630
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:34,812
Typically American.

631
00:35:35,147 --> 00:35:38,417
An Assistant Deputy chief to the US President.

632
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:40,611
wants a secret meeting with the PM.

633
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,237
They move fast.

634
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:42,863
Yeah.

635
00:35:43,364 --> 00:35:46,658
He just left Yokota Air Base.

636
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:48,953
Foreign Ministry's in a uproar.

637
00:35:49,536 --> 00:35:54,268
I hear his aide made an appointment with you.

638
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:56,377
With me? Why?

639
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:57,378
Kayoco Anne-Patterson, Special Presidential Envoy
,

640
00:35:57,378 --> 00:36:00,131
Kayoco Anne-Patterson, Special Presidential Envoy
I read your administrations reports.

641
00:36:00,131 --> 00:36:02,925
I need a person I can work with.

642
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,803
Someone with an interesting history. That's you.

643
00:36:06,346 --> 00:36:10,726
I'm honored, but I think you want Prime Minister aide Akasaka.

644
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:13,770
He turned me down already.

645
00:36:13,895 --> 00:36:16,606
I need a favor that won't stain my record.

646
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:19,985
I want you to find someone.

647
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:23,071
Who may that be?

648
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:28,535
A man who foresaw your creature's appearance several years ago.

649
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:33,457
Interested? We know he landed in Narita 7 days ago.

650
00:36:34,249 --> 00:36:35,376
Goro Maki.

651
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,921
Japanese. Former college professor.

652
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:42,175
I hear your intelligence agency is first-rate.

653
00:36:43,259 --> 00:36:44,468
What's in it for us?

654
00:36:47,889 --> 00:36:51,351
A trade. We gathered intel you might want.

655
00:36:51,893 --> 00:36:55,063
But let's keep it bilateral, okay?

656
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:58,275
Just US-Japan, so, win-win.

657
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:00,569
Understood. Let's get to it.

658
00:37:00,694 --> 00:37:04,084
Thank you. I rushed to Yokota straight from

659
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:07,266
a party, so I didn't have time to change.

660
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:09,804
Where's Zara?

661
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:11,538
Kayoco Anne Patterson.

662
00:37:12,456 --> 00:37:13,875
She's very young.

663
00:37:14,124 --> 00:37:17,086
America admirably values performance over age.

664
00:37:17,211 --> 00:37:19,755
And she's Senator Patterson's daughter.

665
00:37:19,922 --> 00:37:24,052
The one behind the Kern Agreement. Formidable.

666
00:37:24,218 --> 00:37:27,555
A mixture of talent, pedigree and coattails.

667
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:31,476
Not really your type, I suspect.

668
00:37:31,976 --> 00:37:32,644
Nope.

669
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:37,107
If she unabashedly uses her father's connections...

670
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:40,545
...she's the political type, like Yaguchi.

671
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:43,423
Tokyo Central Government Building Two, Chiyoda Ward

Commissioner-General Secretariat, National Police Agency
Searching for an individual at a time like this?

674
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:47,575
For Rando Yaguchi.

675
00:37:48,118 --> 00:37:50,788
I owe a great debt to his father.

676
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:53,624
As many agents as you need.

677
00:37:53,674 --> 00:37:54,083
Sawaguchi, Commissioner's Secretariat

678
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:55,978

Motobe, Criminal Affairs Director

Motobe, Criminal Affairs Director
A rebellious elderly professor once expelled from Japan.

681
00:38:03,176 --> 00:38:06,971
Although a biologist, he worked at a US energy firm.

682
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:08,597
Interesting old man.

683
00:38:08,848 --> 00:38:10,308
A red flag?

684
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,977
No. Just locate him.

685
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:16,773
The NSA or CIA will take it from there.

686
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,442
Discreetly, I hear.

687
00:38:19,735 --> 00:38:21,528
His last whereabouts.

688
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:24,531
My grandma's country sure works fast.

689
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:26,408
But he's gone missing.

690
00:38:26,908 --> 00:38:30,746
The Coast Guard found his boat adrift at sea.

691
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:33,374
Ms. Patterson.

692
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,878
Were you looking for him? Or this?

693
00:38:38,462 --> 00:38:39,630
Yeah, that too.

694
00:38:40,757 --> 00:38:43,551
"I did as I pleased. You do the same."

695
00:38:44,427 --> 00:38:45,470
His last words?

696
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:48,681

697
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:49,515
No need.

698
00:38:50,725 --> 00:38:51,685
I trust you.

699
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:54,646
Special ink. Can't be copied.

700
00:38:54,646 --> 00:38:57,190
I'll take photos to share with my team.

701
00:39:00,527 --> 00:39:02,403
Godzilla?

702
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:07,826
That's right. It's the DOE's code name. "Godzilla".

703
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:10,162
He gave it an English name.

704
00:39:11,496 --> 00:39:12,581
Gojira.

705
00:39:13,666 --> 00:39:14,500
What does it mean?

706
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:16,627
I got one hit.

707
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:22,549
On Ohdo Island, where he's from, it means "God incarnate".

708
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:26,804
A violent one. I hear that's why he put "God" in the name.

709
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:31,101
In Japanese, the name read "Gojira."

710
00:39:31,476 --> 00:39:33,019
"Gojira"...

711
00:39:33,937 --> 00:39:35,080
...you say?

712
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:38,941
Who cares about its name at this point?

713
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,029
It's just as well it originated in the US.

714
00:39:42,487 --> 00:39:45,490
Now we know what to call it.

715
00:39:45,782 --> 00:39:53,582
The government is unofficially calling the giant creature "Gojira."

Goro Maki?

718
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,755
Ex-biology professor at Jonan U.

719
00:40:01,507 --> 00:40:03,634
Find out who he was.

720
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,890
You'll get an exclusive when the time's right to go to print.

721
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:11,934
That's a promise.

722
00:40:11,935 --> 00:40:12,143
Hayafune, Freelance Journalist
,

723
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:15,146
Hayafune, Freelance Journalist
Yes, I know.

724
00:40:20,193 --> 00:40:22,070
Sixty years ago.

725
00:40:22,362 --> 00:40:26,324
So this is all about unregulated dumping of radioactive material.

726
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:32,706
Don't tell me...

727
00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:34,625
Gojira fed on these.

728
00:40:36,168 --> 00:40:36,836
Yes.

729
00:40:37,377 --> 00:40:39,296
That's the DOE's conclusion.

730
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:43,384
They sent requests to various institutions

731
00:40:43,384 --> 00:40:45,344
to analyze the containers.

732
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:47,847
Dr. Maki was the main figure.

733
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:51,601
Suddenly, an ancient species of marine life

734
00:40:51,601 --> 00:40:54,604
found itself surrounded by radioactive waste.

735
00:40:54,979 --> 00:40:59,400
And rapidly mutated into an organism that could withstand it.

736
00:41:00,694 --> 00:41:02,446
That's his Godzilla theory.

737
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:06,741
But it's body lengthened when it came ashore.

738
00:41:06,741 --> 00:41:07,659
Yes.

739
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:11,264
It can suddenly mutate, from sea organism to land.

740
00:41:11,288 --> 00:41:14,958
This new Godzilla surpasses anything I imagined.

741
00:41:15,376 --> 00:41:18,129
This is all the information at my disposal.

742
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:19,922
What comes next...

743
00:41:20,965 --> 00:41:22,049
Personal service.

744
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:32,685
What Dr. Maki left behind.

745
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:36,856
I can't make sense of it.

746
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:42,696
It's not a molecular array. How does it relate to Gojira?

747
00:41:42,696 --> 00:41:46,991
Perhaps an analytical table of structural layers.

748
00:41:46,991 --> 00:41:50,996
Dr. Maki intentionally left out some final data.

749
00:41:50,996 --> 00:41:53,290
We now have the complete version.

750
00:41:54,082 --> 00:41:56,544
Do you mind if we analyze it?

751
00:41:57,295 --> 00:41:58,086
Sure.

752
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:05,886
I'm bad at Japanese honorifics. Can we go informal?

753
00:42:07,722 --> 00:42:08,764
Okay, then tell me...

754
00:42:10,183 --> 00:42:14,270
What does the US want with Gojira? Study or exterminate?

755
00:42:14,771 --> 00:42:16,480
That's for the president to decide.

756
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:21,295
Who decides in your country?

757
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:23,214
Prime Minister's Signature
.

758
00:42:23,238 --> 00:42:26,217
Cabinet Approved Victim Relief and Reconstruction Bill
.

759
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:26,366
Fourth Floor Hallway
,

760
00:42:26,366 --> 00:42:29,994
Fourth Floor Hallway
Finally a cabinet decision on the relief and recovery bill.

761
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:33,332
The Gojira bill, too, will be an interagency nightmare.

762
00:42:33,332 --> 00:42:35,876
Lack of precedent will cloud orders.

763
00:42:35,876 --> 00:42:38,962
Expect a lot of passing the buck.

764
00:42:38,962 --> 00:42:42,090
Second Floor Hallway
At least the security bill passed easily.

765
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,676
Foreign Ministry muscle, under US pressure.

766
00:42:44,676 --> 00:42:49,599
The US wants to use its Gojira info as a diplomatic card.

767
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,579
Let's pray our crafty Aide Akasaka can handle the White House.

768
00:42:53,603 --> 00:42:56,397
Results of the disaster site analysis.
.

769
00:42:56,397 --> 00:42:59,693
Gamma rays match no known elements whatsoever.

770
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:02,695
It's incredible... Gojira, is it?

771
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:05,698
Its body harbors new elements.

772
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,580
This is why the US Dept. of Energy moved so quickly.

773
00:43:12,456 --> 00:43:15,542
Let's take this data with us. Call the PM.

774
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,086
Understood.

775
00:43:17,878 --> 00:43:20,130
More troubling complications.

776
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:22,007
So...

777
00:43:23,216 --> 00:43:24,778
...how much do we say?

778
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:29,556
Having fully analyzed substances recovered from Gojira's path...

779
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:34,228
...radiation of 0,5 microsieverts in the stricken area.

780
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,730
Thanks for the food.

781
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,398
Yes, thank you.

782
00:43:37,898 --> 00:43:41,235
Even with the information the US shared,

783
00:43:41,235 --> 00:43:43,279
I feel gridlock coming.

784
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:46,199
Yeah. Riken's report had impact.

785
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:49,244
Gojira has eight times the genetic info of humans.

786
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:52,599
It'll take years to sequence all of it.

787
00:43:52,623 --> 00:43:56,585
Gojira's the most evolved creature on the planet.

788
00:43:56,835 --> 00:44:00,672
Capable of self-mutation. Not generational.

789
00:44:01,131 --> 00:44:03,092
That trumps human intelligence.

790
00:44:03,217 --> 00:44:06,595
It's still mortal. It can be killed.

791
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,139
I sure hope so.

792
00:44:08,431 --> 00:44:11,100
That's what we're here to find out.

793
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:14,395
Any clues into its behavior?

794
00:44:14,395 --> 00:44:16,021
It just walks

795
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:19,734
Why did it suddenly decide to return to Tokyo Bay?

796
00:44:23,154 --> 00:44:24,155
I got it.

797
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:26,199
Cooling.

798
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:32,664
Gojira has something of a nuclear reactor on its body.

799
00:44:32,873 --> 00:44:37,293
Its fins are heat vents, meaning it has a blood-cooling system.

800
00:44:37,419 --> 00:44:40,464
So it retrogressed to sea creature temporarily

801
00:44:40,464 --> 00:44:43,675
to adjust its body temperature after mutating.

802
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:46,679
Maybe our only hope is to shut down

803
00:44:46,679 --> 00:44:48,782
its internal cooling system.

804
00:44:48,806 --> 00:44:53,186
Forcing Gojira to do a reactor scram to stay alive.

805
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:57,875
Rapid cooling may not kill him, but could immobilize him.

807

Machida, METI Manufacturing Director
Like administering a blood coagulation drug.

808
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:03,779
Is it possible with Gojira upright?

809
00:45:03,947 --> 00:45:06,300
We'll examine practical methods.

810
00:45:06,324 --> 00:45:08,785
Perhaps a compression pump.

811
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:11,288
Takeo, MLIT Disaster Management & Transport Safety Deputy Director
We, the health ministry and METI,

812
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:15,167
Takeo, MLIT Disaster Management & Transport Safety Deputy Director
will gather the necessary coagulant and equipment.

813
00:45:15,167 --> 00:45:18,253
Submit it to the PM as the "Yaguchi Plan."

814
00:45:18,253 --> 00:45:19,045
Understood.

815
00:45:21,256 --> 00:45:23,300
Name aside, let's get on it.

816
00:45:25,344 --> 00:45:27,847
"Godzilla is God!"

817
00:45:27,847 --> 00:45:30,975
"Save Godzilla!"

818
00:45:59,337 --> 00:46:00,923
Good morning, Tea?

819
00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:02,924
Thank you.

820
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:04,676
Thank you!

821
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:09,723
I think we all could use a break.

822
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:19,317
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary's office guests
,

823
00:46:19,317 --> 00:46:22,612
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary's office guests
Everyone is collaborating voluntarily.

824
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,283
They don't go home to rest, not even when they are asked to.

825
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:31,246
And if they do, they come back early with warm food for everyone.

826
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,332
It's very inspiring.

827
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:38,337
None of that jurisdictional infighting among ministries.

828
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,048
Just people working together.

829
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:46,053
A lot of outsiders have tirelessly volunteered their time, too.

830
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,846
You're right.

831
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,558
There's hope for this country yet.

832
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,268
Truly.

833
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,104
One question, though.

834
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,441
When did you last change your shirt?

835
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,320
To be honest, it smells a little rank.

836
00:47:04,989 --> 00:47:05,782
Really?

837
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,910
A shower would do you good.

838
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:18,169
Gojira has resurfaced in Sagami Bay!

839
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,647
And it's coming ashore!

840
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:23,425
Cape Inamura, Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture
.

841
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:40,401
J-Alert! Broadcast that Gojira has come ashore!

842
00:47:40,401 --> 00:47:43,988
Primary alert over Em-Net transmitted!

843
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:48,702
This is Kamakura Disaster Prevention.

844
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:53,123
This is an emergency evacuation order.

845
00:47:53,123 --> 00:47:59,438
A colossal-sized, unidentified creature has come ashore.

846
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:04,050
Everyone is urged to evacuate the city immediately.

847
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:07,054
Repeat. Evacuate immediately.

848
00:48:07,512 --> 00:48:11,642
Please follow the instructions of police and fire personnel.

849
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,101
The Prime Minister.

850
00:48:47,596 --> 00:48:50,725
Gojira is moving towards Kamariya.

851
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:54,019
Am I crazy or has it gotten bigger?

852
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:56,314
Beyond expectation.

853
00:48:56,522 --> 00:48:58,441
Different face and body.

854
00:48:58,566 --> 00:49:01,318
Yes. His size has nearly doubled.

855
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:04,697
Gojira's evolved into it's fourth form.

856
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:11,454
This will be disastrous.

857
00:49:21,298 --> 00:49:21,423
Yokodai, Isogo Ward, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture
,

858
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:25,176
Yokodai, Isogo Ward, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture
Citizens, take refuge indoors!

859
00:49:25,552 --> 00:49:29,140
This area is under curfew.

860
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:34,645
You are in the designated evacuation zone.

861
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,105
Your attention, citizens!

862
00:49:53,832 --> 00:49:57,126
Gojira expected to reach Tokyo in three hours.

863
00:49:57,126 --> 00:49:57,752
Tsukuda, Minister of Justice
,

864
00:49:57,752 --> 00:49:59,463
Tsukuda, Minister of Justice
Why's it coming here again?

865
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,465
Ogimachi, Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture
.

866
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:25,198
A direct armed assault on its body

867
00:50:25,198 --> 00:50:28,743
runs the risk of releasing radioactive material.

868
00:50:28,743 --> 00:50:33,122
Preventing its progression into the metro region is top priority.

869
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,792
I hear it lives on radioactive material.

870
00:50:36,792 --> 00:50:39,504
If it attacks a nuclear facility,

871
00:50:39,796 --> 00:50:41,756
it'll spell a worse disaster.

872
00:50:41,965 --> 00:50:42,757
Prime Minister.

873
00:50:43,925 --> 00:50:46,803
We must stop him now.

874
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:51,141

This residence is in Gojira's path.

1049
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:51,912
The SDF failed to stop it.

1050
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:54,414
The US military may also.

1051
01:01:54,873 --> 01:01:57,876
Are you saying evacuate from here?

1052
01:01:58,085 --> 01:02:02,756
Yes. Other key functions, too, must go immediately

1053
01:02:02,965 --> 01:02:05,885
to a secondary facility in Tachikawa.

1054
01:02:06,552 --> 01:02:09,054
The US strike is about to begin.

1055
01:02:09,305 --> 01:02:13,601
I have a duty to stay and monitor its execution.

1056
01:02:13,852 --> 01:02:17,230
I can't abandon the citizens to make my escape.

1057
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:23,486
Mr. Prime Minister. You can leave because you've the nation to protect.

1058
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:24,947
Please evacuate.

1059
01:02:25,238 --> 01:02:27,949
Tokyo city hall is still functioning.

1060
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:31,745
For now, let Governor Kozuka take charge.

1061
01:02:33,538 --> 01:02:34,874
Understood.

1062
01:02:35,207 --> 01:02:37,167
2 helicopters will arrive on the roof.

1063
01:02:37,376 --> 01:02:39,420
We'll go by car.

1064
01:02:39,837 --> 01:02:44,050
Okay. Go ahead. It'll take some time.

1065
01:02:45,592 --> 01:02:47,929
Traffic will be murder.

1066
01:02:49,138 --> 01:02:50,765
We'll meet later.

1067
01:02:50,765 --> 01:02:52,850
Okay. I'll crawl if I have to.

1068
01:02:53,184 --> 01:02:58,857
A mandatory evacuation order has been issued. Please vacate at once.

Sotobori Avenue, Akasaka, Minato Ward

1070
01:03:17,292 --> 01:03:20,420
Gridlock. Traffic's not going to move.

1071
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:25,301
The strike is coming. We need to get everyone out.

1072
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:36,937
So that's Gojira.

1073
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,649
The strike will occur ahead of schedule.

Way to go, USA.

1080
01:04:06,218 --> 01:04:09,138

GSDF Rotary Wing Eurocopter EC-225LP Transport Helicopter
.

1085
01:04:39,545 --> 01:04:43,757
Gojira's back seems to be glowing. No further details.

1086
01:04:44,424 --> 01:04:45,801
To do what?

1087
01:05:13,872 --> 01:05:14,957
Nobody around.

1088
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,000
Get inside Deputy.

1095
01:05:28,428 --> 01:05:32,392
Godzilla. Truly a god incarnate.

1096
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,728
The target is shooting some unidentified weapon from the front.

1097
01:05:35,728 --> 01:05:38,397
Bomber 2 and Bomber 3 will circle in from behind.

1098
01:05:38,397 --> 01:05:42,068
Payback time. Roger. Payback.

High levels of radiation are projected.

1108
01:07:23,757 --> 01:07:27,595
People are urged  to remain indoors for at least 49 hours...

1109
01:07:27,803 --> 01:07:32,225
How much radiation has Gojira released on Tokyo?

1110
01:07:32,516 --> 01:07:35,269
Don't wait for the government. Decide here.

1111
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:37,897
I hear radioactivity is high.

1112
01:07:38,189 --> 01:07:40,816
Will they distribute iodine tablets?

1113
01:07:41,025 --> 01:07:46,572
Nuclear, biological and chemical response teams are being deployed.

1114
01:07:46,572 --> 01:07:49,075

Homeless city refugees are estimated to be in the millions.

1118
01:08:20,566 --> 01:08:24,612
Government officials are hoping to avoid a political vacuum.

1119

1124
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:47,886
Deputy Chief Yaguchi! I'll call back.

1125
01:08:48,012 --> 01:08:49,138
Mr. Izumi.

1126
01:08:49,263 --> 01:08:50,722
I'm glad you're safe.

1127
01:08:50,722 --> 01:08:54,894
To think that going home on Friday saved me.

1128
01:08:55,102 --> 01:08:57,313
You're injured. You all right?

1129
01:08:57,313 --> 01:09:00,209
Sorry. Bandages are in short supply.

1130
01:09:00,233 --> 01:09:02,652
That's okay. No big deal.

1131
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:05,071
Tokyo is directing fire and rescue.

1132
01:09:05,362 --> 01:09:06,698
No Internal Ministry.

1133
01:09:06,906 --> 01:09:07,073

I need information. Where's Gojira?

1140
01:09:17,709 --> 01:09:21,338
Inactive near Tokyo Station. Who knows why.

1141
01:09:21,588 --> 01:09:22,840
Radiation levels?

1142
01:09:23,090 --> 01:09:26,885
The Nuclear Regulation Authority personnel are busy getting readings.

1143
01:09:27,636 --> 01:09:30,972
Gojira's dripping radiation from its mouth...

1144
01:09:30,972 --> 01:09:32,641
but only trace amounts.

Hisamatsu, Nation-First Party Deputy Chairman Public Secretary
Its plume blew out to sea...

1147
01:09:34,894 --> 01:09:37,480
but contamination is widespread.

1148
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:40,358
The hard-hit wards are uninhabitable.

1149
01:09:40,608 --> 01:09:42,193
On top of being contaminated.

1150
01:09:42,443 --> 01:09:44,946
Well conditions are pretty grave...

1151
01:09:45,154 --> 01:09:48,533
We lack manpower, materials and legal infrastructure.

1152
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:50,243
They're all dead.

1153
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:54,205
The Prime Minister, Chief Cabinet Secretary, everybody.

1154
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:56,541
Don't go to pieces!

1155
01:09:56,667 --> 01:09:59,002
We'll make do with the survivors!

1156
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:00,253
Yaguchi...

1157
01:10:01,505 --> 01:10:03,465
Calm yourself first.

1158
01:10:21,692 --> 01:10:22,818
I'm sorry.

1159
01:10:25,571 --> 01:10:27,507
Who's the acting PM?

1160
01:10:27,782 --> 01:10:31,411
Evacuation center (Unoshima Elementary Gym), Kazo City, Saitama
The ruling party has named Agriculture Minister, Yusuke Satomi

1161
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:33,871
as Acting Prime Minister.

1162
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,810
He will head a provisional emergency government...

1163
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:38,084

quickly naming a new cabinet...

1165

to fill the political vacuum.

Giant Unidentified Creature Response Task Force HQ
,

1167
01:10:43,548 --> 01:10:46,093
Giant Unidentified Creature Response Task Force HQ
So a man with factional seniority,

1168
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:50,222
and whose loyalty made him a minister,

1169
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:52,475
is now the Prime Minister.

1170
01:10:52,766 --> 01:10:56,187
I hear it was foisted on him by the party secretary.

1171
01:10:56,395 --> 01:10:59,958
Who wants responsibility at a time like this?

1172
01:10:59,982 --> 01:11:00,399
Director's Office, Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ, Tachikawa City
,

1173
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:03,670

Kazakoshi, Executive Secretary to the Prime Minister
,

1175
01:11:03,944 --> 01:11:07,573
Kazakoshi, Executive Secretary to the Prime Minister
I suppose we'll have to wait and see.

1176
01:11:08,074 --> 01:11:09,993
Can the Foreign Ministry act?

1177
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:10,243
Katayama, Acting Foreign Affairs Minister
,

1178
01:11:10,243 --> 01:11:12,746
Katayama, Acting Foreign Affairs Minister
We're still getting up and running.

1179
01:11:13,287 --> 01:11:17,292
At any rate, just try to avoid unforeseen surprises.

1180
01:11:19,044 --> 01:11:21,087
I'll let the ambassador know.

1181
01:11:27,927 --> 01:11:28,970
Yusuke Satomi, Acting Prime Minister
,

1182
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:31,098
Yusuke Satomi, Acting Prime Minister
The noodles got soggy.

1183
01:11:34,017 --> 01:11:37,271
I knew this job wouldn't be easy.

1184
01:11:38,356 --> 01:11:41,275
Satomi is a hard man to read.

1185
01:11:41,483 --> 01:11:45,237
Whoever the PM, our job is to keep the ship afloat.

1186
01:11:45,445 --> 01:11:47,573
We need an emergency legislation.

1187
01:11:47,823 --> 01:11:51,785
We're only 30 kilometers from where Gojira's sleeping.

1188
01:11:52,036 --> 01:11:55,081
I'm not worried about that anymore.

1189
01:11:55,665 --> 01:11:59,168
This country's good at quickly picking a successor.

1190
01:11:59,419 --> 01:12:00,628
You next?

1191
01:12:01,213 --> 01:12:02,797
No way.

1192
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:06,635
I'm thinking 10 years.

1193
01:12:06,885 --> 01:12:10,096
If Japan's still around, run for office.

1194
01:12:10,347 --> 01:12:14,643
I'll support you... in exchange for a party secretary post.

1195
01:12:17,395 --> 01:12:20,941
Akasaka was at Yokota, so he was saved.

1196
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:25,362
A politician needs strategy and luck.

1197
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:28,783
Now he's Chief Cabinet Secretary.

1198
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:32,245
You could be more ambitious.

1199
01:12:34,622 --> 01:12:38,627
The Disaster Bureau is a unique path, though...

1200
01:12:39,168 --> 01:12:41,356
You're practically in charge.

1201

Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Director, Cabinet Minister of State for Special Missions
& Giant Unidentified Creature Unified Response Task Force HQ Bureau Chief
No, I'm here to take the fall, if needed.

1203
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:47,177
Akasaka's a shrewd delegator.

1204
01:12:47,761 --> 01:12:51,765
You're the next new aide to the PM on a career track.

1205
01:12:51,765 --> 01:12:53,475
What's wrong with that?

1206
01:12:55,144 --> 01:12:57,646
Why'd you become a politician?

1207
01:12:57,897 --> 01:13:01,525
Because it's just friend or foe. I like the simplicity.

1208
01:13:01,734 --> 01:13:04,612
Bureau members have arrived.

1209
01:13:05,363 --> 01:13:08,633
Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ Office
.

1210
01:13:08,657 --> 01:13:10,577
It's great to see you all.

1211
01:13:10,743 --> 01:13:14,414
Over half of our team has returned. Thank you.

1212
01:13:16,374 --> 01:13:20,169
Our hearts are heavy for those we lost.

1213
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:22,130
Let's do it for them.

1214
01:13:23,548 --> 01:13:25,342
We'll fill their positions.

1215
01:13:25,592 --> 01:13:27,469
While we struggle

1216
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:29,888
with the loss of colleagues and loved ones.

1217
01:13:30,723 --> 01:13:32,558
We can prevail!

1218
01:13:34,351 --> 01:13:36,395
For our countrymen.

1219
01:13:36,853 --> 01:13:41,358
I ask you to pour heart and soul into completing our work.

1220
01:13:41,859 --> 01:13:42,777
I beg you.

1221
01:13:50,869 --> 01:13:53,955
Let's get to work!

1222
01:13:54,413 --> 01:13:56,350
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base
.

1223
01:13:56,374 --> 01:14:00,336
Preliminary conference room
.

1224
01:14:04,423 --> 01:14:07,051
How's the freeze plan going?

1225
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:12,099
Private companies are working on 24 blood procoagulants...

1226
01:14:12,307 --> 01:14:15,143
using silica, thrombin and other agents.

1227
01:14:15,644 --> 01:14:17,646
One of them should work.

1228
01:14:17,646 --> 01:14:18,498
How about samples?

1229
01:14:18,522 --> 01:14:18,564
Hiromi Ogashira, Ministry of the Environment Deputy Chief, Wildlife Division
,

1230
01:14:18,564 --> 01:14:22,502
Hiromi Ogashira, Ministry of the Environment Deputy Chief, Wildlife Division
We've asked GSDF to retrieve some living cells for us.

1231
01:14:22,526 --> 01:14:24,654
GSDF Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle
.

1232
01:14:27,156 --> 01:14:27,782
Roger that.

1233
01:14:28,658 --> 01:14:30,451
Samples retrieved.

1234
01:14:30,826 --> 01:14:33,329
I'll send them to BSL4 labs.

1235
01:14:33,579 --> 01:14:34,288
Good

1236
01:14:34,706 --> 01:14:38,585
Remainder to any P3 level lab, public or private.

1237
01:14:38,876 --> 01:14:41,379
These are government-classified substances.

1238
01:14:41,629 --> 01:14:44,090
We need diverse info on Gojira.

1239
01:14:46,051 --> 01:14:50,347
No change to radiation levels. Below 1 Sievert.

1240
01:14:50,347 --> 01:14:50,555
Roof of Kabukiza Tower, Chuo Ward
,

1241
01:14:50,555 --> 01:14:51,890
Roof of Kabukiza Tower, Chuo Ward
He's a quiet sleeper

1242
01:14:52,141 --> 01:14:53,934
It's storing it all up in its belly.

GSDF Central Nuclear Biological Special Weapon Defense Unit Eleven

1244
01:14:55,769 --> 01:14:56,770
GSDF Central Nuclear Biological Special Weapon Defense Unit Eleven
Shift change.

1245
01:15:00,316 --> 01:15:01,192
Yaguchi.

1246
01:15:01,442 --> 01:15:05,737
Arriving in 5. Secure us a meeting with the acting PM, will you?

1247
01:15:06,447 --> 01:15:09,950
Is that right?

1248
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:11,118
Is that right?

1249
01:15:11,369 --> 01:15:15,414
Yes. There's a movement centered on China and Russia,

1250
01:15:15,664 --> 01:15:18,501
to take Godzilla from under the control of the Japanese government

1251
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:21,546
and put it under the control of international organizations.

1252
01:15:22,088 --> 01:15:24,549
Many countries are aligned with that opinion, too.

1253
01:15:25,425 --> 01:15:28,428
However, as for the US government, we strongly hope

1254
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:33,057
that Japan and the US can perfectly control Godzilla together.

1255
01:15:33,057 --> 01:15:33,892
Hideki Akasaka, Acting Chief Cabinet Secretary 
(Former Aide to the Prime Minister)
.

1256
01:15:33,892 --> 01:15:34,809
Hideki Akasaka, Acting Chief Cabinet Secretary
(Former Aide to the Prime Minister)
Ok.

1257
01:15:36,478 --> 01:15:38,022
From the government point of view,

1258
01:15:38,272 --> 01:15:41,859
it is for that reason that we would agree to a 2-plus 2 cooperation.

1259
01:15:43,569 --> 01:15:47,739
However, as army experts will remain as the  backbone of the government.

1260
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:50,347
We have to respectfully decline your offer

1261
01:15:50,372 --> 01:15:52,769
to remain at the center of decision-making.

1262
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:57,000
In place of that, we will...

1263
01:15:57,167 --> 01:16:00,378
A US-Japan Gojira research coalition?

1264
01:16:00,503 --> 01:16:04,424
The more knowledge, the better. Lets clear some space.

1265
01:16:04,924 --> 01:16:07,052
Nice to meet you. I'm Rando Yaguchi.

1266
01:16:05,007 --> 01:16:07,009
US Godzilla Joint Research Team
.

1267
01:16:09,054 --> 01:16:13,224
From GSDF's latest unmanned surveillance system.

1268
01:16:17,187 --> 01:16:19,773
It froze soon after the attack.

1269
01:16:20,024 --> 01:16:22,067
Same as the D2 simulation.

1270
01:16:22,192 --> 01:16:22,276
Richter, Joint Research Team Leader
,

1271
01:16:22,276 --> 01:16:23,944
Richter, Joint Research Team Leader
Just as I thought...

1272
01:16:24,152 --> 01:16:27,990
It appears that Godzilla has something like a built in phased-array radar.

1273
01:16:28,199 --> 01:16:32,805
So it can instinctively intercept approaching objects.

1274
01:16:32,829 --> 01:16:35,974
US air strike grounds, Minato Ward
.

1275
01:16:35,998 --> 01:16:36,206
GSDF First Special Weapons Defense Unit
,

1276
01:16:36,206 --> 01:16:39,085
GSDF First Special Weapons Defense Unit
Squad 2, this is CV1.

1277
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:41,504
5 minutes from point zero. 10 minutes remain. Over.

1278
01:16:41,712 --> 01:16:43,715
Copy that, CV1.

1279
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:54,685
Cross-referenced field data with Tsukuba's...

1280
01:16:54,893 --> 01:16:57,896
this may be how Gojira plans to propagate.

1281
01:16:59,190 --> 01:17:03,193
Rapid colonization all over the world.

1282
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:08,115
So not only could it evolve to a smaller size...

1283
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,576
it could sprout wings capable of intercontinental flight.

1284
01:17:12,536 --> 01:17:13,454
Let's go

1285
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:17,374
And that will mark the end of the human race.

1286
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,583
Before that happens, using our nuclear wisdom

1287
01:17:20,608 --> 01:17:23,488
is the only road for salvation for mankind.

1288
01:17:23,589 --> 01:17:24,817
Are you serious?

1289
01:17:24,841 --> 01:17:26,801
Tama Monorail Operation Base, Tachikawa City, Tokyo
.

1290
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:30,221
The Defense Secretary thinks its best to hit Gojira...

1291
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,142
with a thermonuclear blast.

1292
01:17:35,727 --> 01:17:37,395
And the White House?

1293
01:17:37,395 --> 01:17:41,733
A report cites a 13% chance of Gojira landing on the US west coast.

1294
01:17:42,651 --> 01:17:47,698
The UN Security Council has set up a multinational Gojira strike force.

1295
01:17:48,783 --> 01:17:50,159
The US is serious.

1296
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,246
Afraid so.

1297
01:17:55,456 --> 01:18:00,336
They say Gojira has to be hit with a nuclear missile.

1298
01:18:01,003 --> 01:18:04,424
The Pentagon's already moved to set explosive yield...

1299
01:18:04,424 --> 01:18:06,927
and burst level for a B83 warhead.

1300
01:18:10,013 --> 01:18:11,806
To be dropped on Tokyo?

1301
01:18:12,348 --> 01:18:14,851
I was ordered to evacuate.

1302
01:18:16,811 --> 01:18:18,313
I see.

1303
01:18:18,939 --> 01:18:21,650
So it's highly likely.

1304
01:18:23,735 --> 01:18:24,986
Yes.

1305
01:18:28,657 --> 01:18:30,409
But I'm not leaving.

1306
01:18:33,245 --> 01:18:35,623
I won't see a third bomb...

1307
01:18:36,915 --> 01:18:41,713
dropped on the country of my mother, and live through it.

1308
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:45,842
Japan-US heads of state conference call
,

1309
01:18:45,842 --> 01:18:50,721
Japan-US heads of state conference call
Certainly. We'll act accordingly, President Ross.

1310
01:18:52,974 --> 01:18:53,183
Matsuzawa, Minister of Foreign Affairs
,

1311
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:57,103
Matsuzawa, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Certainly, we'll act accordingly that way, President Ross.

1312
01:19:04,361 --> 01:19:06,363
Well, you heard it.

1313
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:11,243
That country foists some crazy things on us.

1314
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:13,704
That is certain.

1315
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,293
But this goes too far!

1316
01:19:19,168 --> 01:19:20,294
I agree.

1317
01:19:21,212 --> 01:19:22,421
Call the Chief Cabinet Secretary.

1318
01:19:22,421 --> 01:19:23,047
Yes.

1319
01:19:26,926 --> 01:19:30,972
The UN Security Council has passed a resolution...

1320
01:19:31,306 --> 01:19:34,100
for a US led force

1321
01:19:34,392 --> 01:19:36,603
to exterminate Gojira.

1322
01:19:38,938 --> 01:19:42,234
As party to the resolution and participant...

1323
01:19:43,818 --> 01:19:46,822
our nation will be under its command.

1324
01:19:48,449 --> 01:19:50,200
In other words...

1325
01:19:51,660 --> 01:19:53,913
I'm going to need a special law...

1326
01:19:53,913 --> 01:19:56,916
vesting the Prime Minister with full powers.

1327
01:20:05,508 --> 01:20:07,385
Authorizing...

1328
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:11,097
the use of a nuclear weapon on Tokyo?

1329
01:20:29,575 --> 01:20:33,996
I didn't want to go down in history for anything like this.

1330
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:40,920
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base rooftop
.

1331
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:45,966
From here on, Gojira comes under US led, UN jurisdiction.

1332
01:20:49,971 --> 01:20:52,557
Post-War Japan is a tributary state.

1333
01:20:54,225 --> 01:20:56,728
"Post-War" extends forever...

1334
01:20:57,562 --> 01:20:59,147
You mustn't give up.

1335
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,737
No creature can withstand

1336
01:21:06,196 --> 01:21:09,116
the million-degree heat of a nuke.

1337
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:14,497
As a sure method of extermination, it's the right choice.

1338
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:18,376
We're on the edge of a breakthrough...

1339
01:21:18,792 --> 01:21:20,878
with our freezing method.

1340
01:21:21,462 --> 01:21:24,131
Your plan still has too many unknowns.

1341
01:21:24,381 --> 01:21:28,136
Plus, all countries have pledged their support.

1342
01:21:28,386 --> 01:21:31,931
to a complete rebuilding effort if we sign on.

1343
01:21:32,181 --> 01:21:35,560
If we can't kill Gojira with certainty...

1344
01:21:35,769 --> 01:21:38,480
...we lose the world's trust.

1345
01:21:39,231 --> 01:21:41,859
We must put our fate in the UN's hands.

1346
01:21:43,526 --> 01:21:46,988
My job is to think about what to do for Japan

1347
01:21:47,489 --> 01:21:50,325
after Gojira has been destroyed.

1348
01:21:51,243 --> 01:21:54,705
Right now the damage is limited to three wards.

1349
01:21:54,705 --> 01:21:56,665
They can be rebuilt.

1350
01:21:56,665 --> 01:21:59,252
The city's economy is in a free fall.

1351
01:21:59,252 --> 01:22:02,713
If bonds and stocks continue to plummet...

1352
01:22:02,922 --> 01:22:05,549
The nation with go into default.

1353
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:10,388
Japan needs international sympathy and funding.

1354
01:22:12,432 --> 01:22:14,392
Scrap and build, huh?

1355
01:22:15,268 --> 01:22:16,603
To save the country.

1356
01:22:19,314 --> 01:22:21,024
There's no other way.

1357
01:22:23,401 --> 01:22:24,652
Yaguchi.

1358
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:29,240
This is the reality. All else is just a dream.

1359
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:33,287
A thermonuclear bomb?

1360
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:34,914
Dropped here?

1361
01:22:35,122 --> 01:22:37,917
We just gave the UN its sanction.

1362
01:22:38,125 --> 01:22:39,544
Unbelievable.

1363
01:22:39,794 --> 01:22:43,589
How do we know it hasn't made itself immortal?

1364
01:22:44,507 --> 01:22:49,220
The choice is incinerate with a nuke; or freeze with a drug.

1365
01:22:49,428 --> 01:22:54,267
Yes, that is a choice. But not a good one.

1366
01:22:54,475 --> 01:22:57,478
Man is more frightening than Gojira.

1367
01:22:57,687 --> 01:23:02,484
The UN coalition will of course give time for evacuation.

1368
01:23:02,734 --> 01:23:04,736
That's our window for finishing.

1369
01:23:04,986 --> 01:23:09,366
We got something that worked well on the samples.

1370
01:23:09,574 --> 01:23:10,701
Now comes production.

1371
01:23:10,951 --> 01:23:12,828
To freeze all of its blood...

1372
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:15,997
we'll need 672 kiloliters of coagulant.

1373
01:23:16,248 --> 01:23:18,417
I'm securing facilities as we speak.

1374
01:23:18,583 --> 01:23:19,543
Can we make it?

1375
01:23:19,543 --> 01:23:21,587
We have to!

1376
01:23:22,296 --> 01:23:25,841
Don't give up. Don't abandon this country.

1377
01:23:25,841 --> 01:23:28,636
Ask every private chemical company you know...

1378
01:23:28,845 --> 01:23:31,764
to open every line possible.

1379
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,100
I'll send all pertinent data.

1380
01:23:34,308 --> 01:23:38,313
Ask everyone to finish production by tomorrow.

1381
01:23:38,604 --> 01:23:41,191
We're getting broad cross-checking.

1382
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:43,276
Spreading knowledge works.

1383
01:23:56,498 --> 01:24:00,502
Logistics for police and MLIT to ship the coagulant.

1384
01:24:00,711 --> 01:24:01,796
I'll do that.

1385
01:24:02,046 --> 01:24:04,757
I need METI to coordinate pump makers.

1386
01:24:05,925 --> 01:24:08,677
If we agree to buy them...

1387
01:24:08,886 --> 01:24:10,888
Shanghai will give us 3 tank trucks.

1388
01:24:11,097 --> 01:24:14,225
We need 5 more wheel loaders, any size.

1389
01:24:19,356 --> 01:24:20,898
Ambassador Lansing

1390
01:24:21,107 --> 01:24:25,361
just reported coalition projections...

1391
01:24:25,612 --> 01:24:27,406
that Gojira's energy beam...

1392
01:24:27,656 --> 01:24:30,450
will be restored within 360 hours to previous levels.

1393

Shuichi Izumi, Acting Special Advisor to the Prime Minister

Shuichi Izumi, Acting Special Advisor to the Prime Minister
Matsuzawa, Minister of Foreign Affairs
The creature is likely to resume activity in 15 days.

1395
01:24:38,250 --> 01:24:39,060
I see.

US Forces Japan Yokota Air Base Command HQ, Fussa City

1397
01:24:39,126 --> 01:24:41,253
US Forces Japan Yokota Air Base Command HQ, Fussa City
A charter home will be leaving in an hour.

1398
01:24:41,253 --> 01:24:44,048
All remaining staff, prepare to leave immediately.

1399
01:24:44,506 --> 01:24:44,548
Cartland, US Army Colonel
,

1400
01:24:44,548 --> 01:24:47,593
Cartland, US Army Colonel
The start time for the nuclear strike against Godzilla has been decided.

1401
01:24:47,593 --> 01:24:49,136
,
Countdown will begin in 5 minutes.

1402
01:24:49,136 --> 01:24:49,929
Paine, US Forces Commander
Countdown will begin in 5 minutes.

1403
01:24:49,929 --> 01:24:52,848
Paine, US Forces Commander
So it's too late to turn back now.

1404
01:24:52,848 --> 01:24:52,931
Lansing, US Ambassador to Japan
,

1405
01:24:52,931 --> 01:24:55,059
Lansing, US Ambassador to Japan
Japan has been given a two-week grace period in order to

1406
01:24:55,059 --> 01:24:58,187
in order to evacuate remaining residents.

1407
01:24:58,396 --> 01:25:03,651
That may seem long for the Allied Forces, but it's too short for Japan.

1408
01:25:05,528 --> 01:25:10,617
Evacuation means uprooting people from their beloved homes.

1409
01:25:12,869 --> 01:25:15,122
Don't make it sound so easy.

1410
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:16,623
Agreed.

1411
01:25:16,832 --> 01:25:19,710
Evacuating 3.6 million people? Preposterous!

1412
01:25:19,918 --> 01:25:21,962
We don't have the manpower.

1413
01:25:22,212 --> 01:25:25,591
Not to mention millions more in neighboring prefectures.

1414
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:28,344
The governor protests the sacrifice of Tokyo.

1415
01:25:28,594 --> 01:25:31,556
This is a national decision, not a municipal one.

1416
01:25:31,806 --> 01:25:36,186
Relocation selection and approvals can't happen in 2 weeks.

1417
01:25:36,394 --> 01:25:38,730
The moment Gojira resumes activity...

1418
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:41,941
the strike time will move up unconditionally.

1419
01:25:42,191 --> 01:25:44,236
Regardless of collateral risk.

1420
01:25:44,444 --> 01:25:49,116
A thermonuclear warhead will be launched from a sub at that time...

1421
01:25:49,324 --> 01:25:51,451
as per the coalition decision.

1422
01:25:52,202 --> 01:25:56,206
What bull! Easy for them to talk about far-off Asia.

1423
01:25:56,623 --> 01:26:01,045
If it were in NY, they say the same would apply.

1424
01:26:02,379 --> 01:26:05,841
Evacuation bus depot, Taito Ward

GSDF Kisarazu Base, Chiba Prefecture

1428
01:26:33,578 --> 01:26:37,809
Over 3.6 million Tokyo refugees evacuated to locations nationwide

Showa Memorial Park, Tachikawa City, Tokyo
,

1430
01:26:38,834 --> 01:26:42,254
Showa Memorial Park, Tachikawa City, Tokyo
Land prices are soaring in west Japan. Food is short.

1431
01:26:42,755 --> 01:26:45,633
Kanto area companies and shops are shuttered.

1432
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,718
City's full of the unemployed.

1433
01:26:49,428 --> 01:26:52,139
The yen's plunge reflects investor fears...

1434
01:26:52,849 --> 01:26:55,184
...except from those profiting from it.

1435
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,729
People come in all forms.

1436
01:27:00,398 --> 01:27:02,108
You have information?

1437
01:27:02,275 --> 01:27:05,779
I do. It's my job after all.

1438
01:27:06,237 --> 01:27:11,033
How about printing my article a day prior to the bomb drop?

1439
01:27:14,037 --> 01:27:16,206
New Gojira material.

1440
01:27:17,124 --> 01:27:20,502
In exchange, we can control the announcement timing.

1441
01:27:20,961 --> 01:27:22,546
How's that?

1442
01:27:22,838 --> 01:27:24,840
I understand.

1443
01:27:30,346 --> 01:27:35,559
The professor loathed the radiation sickness that took his wife's life.

1444
01:27:37,144 --> 01:27:40,732
He hoped to render radioactive materials harmless.

1445
01:27:42,275 --> 01:27:46,947
If that's possible, so is the creation of a new material.

1446
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:49,658
He must have feared the military.

1447
01:27:49,866 --> 01:27:52,952
That explains his redacting the DOE data.

1448
01:27:53,870 --> 01:27:56,874
He hated radioactive materials.

1449
01:27:57,582 --> 01:28:00,836
And maybe anyone involved with it.

1450
01:28:02,629 --> 01:28:06,175
Including Japan, which left his wife to die.

1451
01:28:07,218 --> 01:28:10,763
Then he leaves his data and writes, "Do as you like"?

1452
01:28:11,346 --> 01:28:12,723
Strange person.

1453
01:28:15,351 --> 01:28:17,686
So what did he do in the end?

1454
01:28:27,447 --> 01:28:29,324
Good meal.

1455
01:28:32,368 --> 01:28:34,162
Solve the chart yet?

1456
01:28:34,371 --> 01:28:37,874
Not even with help from a cryptographer.

1457
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:39,709
Anything from the US?

1458
01:28:40,002 --> 01:28:42,963
I wouldn't rely on them right now.

1459
01:28:43,171 --> 01:28:47,843
We regard it as important for a multi-tiered approach.

1460
01:28:48,052 --> 01:28:51,513
It resembles a mandala more than a chemical schematic.

1461
01:28:51,723 --> 01:28:55,350
Or working backwards from the solution.

1462
01:28:55,601 --> 01:28:57,687
He was a little twisted.

1463
01:28:59,397 --> 01:29:01,690
I'm even baffled by its simple lines.

1464
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,902
Why did he put it on paper, not data?

1465
01:29:05,487 --> 01:29:08,823
Perhaps it's meant to be folded.

1466
01:29:11,492 --> 01:29:14,412
With a body like Gojira's...

1467
01:29:14,663 --> 01:29:18,542
old radioactive waste must leave it hungry.

1468
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:19,709
No doubt.

1469
01:29:20,377 --> 01:29:24,673
Crooked teeth. It can't even prey on nuclear waste.

1470
01:29:31,430 --> 01:29:33,015
Origami.

1471
01:29:37,562 --> 01:29:38,688
It's not eaten.

1472
01:29:38,896 --> 01:29:41,607
We grasped the entire pattern.

1473
01:29:41,816 --> 01:29:44,735
The new information came from making folds.

1474
01:29:44,986 --> 01:29:47,488
We focused on radiation as its energy.

1475
01:29:47,697 --> 01:29:51,993
This is a molecular chart for converting elements in the body.

1476
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:54,537
Element conversion molecules.

1477
01:29:54,787 --> 01:29:58,750
The unknown radioactive isotope is the proof.

1478
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:02,128
Say hydrogen or nitrogen entering the cell...

1479
01:30:02,337 --> 01:30:04,423
where it's converted to necessary molecules.

1480
01:30:04,631 --> 01:30:09,553
Gojira's a mixotroph with an organ that converts decaying heat.

1481
01:30:10,012 --> 01:30:11,805
A bold but viable hypothesis.

1482
01:30:14,058 --> 01:30:16,727
It can live anywhere there is water or oxygen.

1483
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:18,980
Like an ascetic surviving on mist.

1484
01:30:19,188 --> 01:30:22,567
So Gojira's is both a threat to mankind...

1485
01:30:22,858 --> 01:30:26,737
but also poses a revelation of limitless potential.

1486
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:31,660
But then the blood coagulant may be ineffective inside its body...

1487
01:30:32,035 --> 01:30:33,411
killing the Yaguchi Plan.

1488
01:30:33,411 --> 01:30:35,205
Possibly. So what now?

1489
01:30:35,372 --> 01:30:37,833
we raise certainty of working.

1490
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:41,878
First, analyze this structure, then a way around it.

1491
01:30:42,087 --> 01:30:45,215
I'm having supercomputers run parallel analysis...

1492
01:30:45,465 --> 01:30:47,717
but the results are days away.

1493
01:30:48,343 --> 01:30:50,179
We've only got 10.

1494
01:30:50,429 --> 01:30:53,807
I asked MEXT to use their global connections.

01:30:53,807 --> 01:30:54,642
Burghead Computer Science Laboratory, Germany
,

1496
01:30:54,642 --> 01:30:56,394
Burghead Computer Science Laboratory, Germany
Call from Japan.

1497
01:30:56,602 --> 01:30:59,772
They're requesting parallel computing.

1498
01:30:59,981 --> 01:31:01,482
We can't.

1499
01:31:05,820 --> 01:31:08,531
This is a closed system. We can't risk our data being stolen.

1500
01:31:08,781 --> 01:31:14,078
Come, come. Where's your trust in your fellow men?

1501
01:31:14,704 --> 01:31:18,958
Tell them we'd be happy to do it!

1502
01:31:18,958 --> 01:31:22,045
Supercomputer cluster
.

1503
01:31:30,512 --> 01:31:32,807
We've solved Maki's riddle!

1504
01:31:38,145 --> 01:31:39,522
Here.

1505
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:42,733
Incredible.

1506
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,879
It's not the cell membrane itself.

1507
01:31:45,903 --> 01:31:51,326
But an extremophile configuration that inhibits cell membrane activity.

1508
01:31:53,661 --> 01:31:57,457
This inhibitor could keep the blood coagulant viable.

1509
01:31:57,457 --> 01:31:59,083
There's still hope.

1510
01:32:01,294 --> 01:32:02,462
It looks good.

1511
01:32:05,132 --> 01:32:06,299
Okay.

1512
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:09,678
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base rooftop
,

1513
01:32:09,678 --> 01:32:12,764
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base rooftop
I get the feeling Goro Maki anticipated this.

1514
01:32:13,891 --> 01:32:18,020
Maybe releasing this destructive God as a sort of test...

1515
01:32:19,146 --> 01:32:22,941
on mankind, this country, we Japanese.

1516
01:32:23,401 --> 01:32:27,363
"Do as you like", including the use of nuclear weapons.

1517
01:32:29,115 --> 01:32:30,492
Maybe so.

1518
01:32:32,034 --> 01:32:33,995
"Do as you please", huh?

1519
01:32:37,165 --> 01:32:38,333
But...

1520
01:32:39,459 --> 01:32:42,086
that's hard to do in this country.

1521
01:32:44,548 --> 01:32:45,173
It is.

1522
01:32:47,134 --> 01:32:48,218
By oneself.

1523
01:32:48,677 --> 01:32:53,224
Sir, we're ironing out the last kinks on the Yaguchi Plan.

1524
01:32:53,599 --> 01:32:56,435
We ask your approval to deploy it.

1525
01:32:56,853 --> 01:32:58,562
Yes, but Izumi.

1526
01:32:59,396 --> 01:33:02,400
A UN resolution is already passed.

1527
01:33:03,150 --> 01:33:06,570
Some say that the US seeks a quick resolution

1528
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:08,782
to bury their knowledge of Gojira.

1529
01:33:09,032 --> 01:33:11,200
We know that!

1530
01:33:12,326 --> 01:33:14,787
And you know our country's condition.

1531
01:33:15,037 --> 01:33:16,289
But Sir...

1532
01:33:16,497 --> 01:33:20,627
...forcing one country's sacrifice for self-gain is deplorable.

1533
01:33:23,129 --> 01:33:24,423
So you're saying...

1534
01:33:25,089 --> 01:33:28,677
...act unilaterally on humanitarian principle.

1535
01:33:29,552 --> 01:33:33,223
Perhaps it's time we did as we wanted.

1536
01:33:34,767 --> 01:33:36,101
You're right.

1537
01:33:37,478 --> 01:33:40,439
So, where do I affix my stamp.

1538
01:33:40,439 --> 01:33:44,193
GSDF Reception Room, Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base
,

1539
01:33:44,193 --> 01:33:47,946
GSDF Reception Room, Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base
"A strategy to administer a coagulate"

1540
01:33:47,946 --> 01:33:50,491
,
"to freeze and thus render the creature immobile."

1541
01:33:51,242 --> 01:33:52,326
It's long-winded.

1542
01:33:54,453 --> 01:33:55,705
What do we call it?

1543
01:33:56,122 --> 01:34:00,626
Operation "Yashiori", after the sake Susanowo used to put a hydra to sleep.

1544
01:34:01,461 --> 01:34:04,715
Very well. We'll run it in 5 phases.

1545
01:34:04,923 --> 01:34:06,966
Asaka is working on details.

1546
01:34:07,342 --> 01:34:11,221
Vehicle operation...

1547
01:34:11,221 --> 01:34:13,598
and explosives drills have already been conducted.

1548
01:34:13,598 --> 01:34:15,225
We're execution ready.

1549
01:34:16,685 --> 01:34:17,811
Many thanks.

1550
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:19,521
No need.

1551
01:34:19,896 --> 01:34:21,107
It's our job.

1552
01:34:31,326 --> 01:34:33,494
Countdown's at 2 days.

1553
01:34:36,289 --> 01:34:37,123
Damn.

1554
01:34:37,331 --> 01:34:40,853
I still need three days to make enough coagulant.

1555
01:34:40,877 --> 01:34:43,088
Can't the countdown be suspended?

1556
01:34:43,213 --> 01:34:46,925
Who in the Security Council can we get to help stall?

1557
01:34:47,133 --> 01:34:50,387
Not China and Russia. Too geopolitically close.

1558
01:34:50,679 --> 01:34:55,851
How about France? Nuclear country. They'd be interested in  the biology.

1559
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:58,436
I have a back channel I can use.

1560
01:34:58,687 --> 01:34:59,438
Please.

1561
01:34:59,647 --> 01:35:01,524
I'll try the Euro Bureau Chief.

1562
01:35:01,732 --> 01:35:03,942
And I the Foreign Minister.

1563
01:35:04,193 --> 01:35:07,029

China and Russia are opposed, but we're maintaining silence.

China and Russia are opposed, but we're maintaining silence.

1568

Cussing, US Official
China and Russia are opposed, but we're maintaining silence.

1569
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,818
That's because it isn't just hardliners

1570
01:35:18,843 --> 01:35:21,503
at the nucleus of Washington and the Pentagon.

1571
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:24,839
Japan has grown up enough

1572
01:35:25,048 --> 01:35:27,926
to have international trade deals on the sly.

1573
01:35:29,469 --> 01:35:32,639
Dangerous in another opportunity for personal growth.

1574
01:35:36,601 --> 01:35:40,606
Our friends are progressing with an effective deep freeze plan.

1575
01:35:42,733 --> 01:35:45,194
I think this country is betting on it.

1576
01:35:45,694 --> 01:35:48,405
And you're rising that bet also, I see.

1577
01:35:49,406 --> 01:35:52,409
Nuclear weapons are a deterrent.

1578
01:35:53,578 --> 01:35:57,290
I've been trying to advise Charles against it.

1579
01:35:57,832 --> 01:36:00,293
But it goes against the flow of the mainstream.

1580
01:36:01,335 --> 01:36:04,923
And you and I must bear the risk of retaliation.

1581
01:36:05,299 --> 01:36:06,799
Me, I'm ok.

1582
01:36:07,175 --> 01:36:11,239
But you, with your fastidious career,

1583
01:36:11,263 --> 01:36:15,141
and the Patterson name, mud will stick.

1584
01:36:16,685 --> 01:36:21,356
And your dream of becoming President in your 40s will disappear.

1585
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:39,292
Hey, Kayoko!

1586
01:36:41,836 --> 01:36:42,503
Good luck.

1587
01:36:44,047 --> 01:36:44,649

1592
01:36:49,844 --> 01:36:52,890
Can our independent commands be coordinated?

1593
01:36:53,306 --> 01:36:55,308
You've made friends.

1594
01:36:55,517 --> 01:36:58,269
Lots of Air Force and Marine volunteers.

1595
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:02,149
Even drones if you need it. What do you say?

1596
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:03,818
I'm in.

1597
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:06,755
But there is no guarantee of them coming back in one piece.

1598
01:37:06,779 --> 01:37:09,573
Of course. I'll bill the Japanese government later.

Won't you reconsider accompanying the front line troops?

1607
01:37:39,312 --> 01:37:42,441
A political decision may be needed.

1608
01:37:42,691 --> 01:37:44,193
And time will be critical.

1609
01:37:44,193 --> 01:37:47,654
Too risky. Policymakers can direct from the rear.

1610
01:37:48,113 --> 01:37:49,865
You want to be PM in 10 years?

1611
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:54,077
Got to make sure the country's around in 10 years.

we've got the young talent, public and private.

1613

Like you. We'll have leaders.

1614
01:38:06,799 --> 01:38:09,135
You've kept me going. Thanks.

1615
01:38:09,302 --> 01:38:11,805
Nonsense. Thank Akasaka's mentoring.

there's a high risk of acute exposure to radiation heat.

1623

I cannot promise that all will be safe

1624
01:38:54,933 --> 01:38:56,935
But your work will matter!

1625
01:39:02,107 --> 01:39:05,360
Our country's greatest strength is found in the field.

01:47:06,277 --> 01:47:08,321
First 20 tanks are running out.

1728
01:47:08,530 --> 01:47:11,658
Got it. Switch tanks to 21 and above!

1729
01:47:13,952 --> 01:47:15,913
60% of supply administered!

1730
01:47:30,595 --> 01:47:32,513
75% of supply gone!

1731
01:47:32,763 --> 01:47:35,516
We've passed the projected coagulant minimum.

1732
01:47:39,311 --> 01:47:41,147
90% of supply administered.

1733
01:47:45,276 --> 01:47:48,279
100% used. Critical point reached.

1734
01:47:48,529 --> 01:47:50,949
The target's skin is stiffening!

1735
01:47:51,157 --> 01:47:52,742
Please work.

1736
01:48:05,339 --> 01:48:06,215
Did it work?

1737
01:48:12,221 --> 01:48:14,098
The target has resumed activity!

1738
01:48:14,098 --> 01:48:15,850
Full evacuation now!

1739
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:18,895
Change positions! Hurry!

1740
01:48:19,145 --> 01:48:23,274
Abandon attack and quickly evacuate to holding area!

1741
01:48:36,120 --> 01:48:40,542
Chest area temperature has dropped to -196 degrees.

1742
01:48:41,085 --> 01:48:42,711
Gojira...

1743
01:48:43,295 --> 01:48:45,172
has been completely silenced!

1744
01:48:48,842 --> 01:48:52,096
Operation Yashiori is terminated.

1745
01:49:01,105 --> 01:49:04,108
Thank you. All were remarkable

1746
01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:14,870
We were down to under an hour.

1747
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:16,872
Too close for comfort.

1748
01:49:17,080 --> 01:49:20,810
But we owe it to the PM convincing France.

1749
01:49:20,834 --> 01:49:23,587
Morelli, French Ambassador to Japan

1750
01:49:28,634 --> 01:49:29,843
Excuse me!

1751
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:33,680
Look at this survey data.

1752
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:46,461
Gojira's new isotope has a half-life of 20 days.

1753
01:49:46,485 --> 01:49:50,073
It'll be halved in a month, gone in 2, 3 years.

1754
01:49:50,282 --> 01:49:53,952
That's good news for Tokyo residents.

1755
01:49:58,414 --> 01:49:59,625
Thank god.

1756
01:50:07,007 --> 01:50:09,301
GSDF Nerima Base, Nerima Ward
.

1757
01:50:11,720 --> 01:50:12,846
Good work.

1758
01:50:14,890 --> 01:50:19,103
The Satomi cabinet will be resigning en masse.

1759
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:22,732
In line with your scenario?

1760
01:50:22,732 --> 01:50:26,652
It wasn't mine. This was all PM Satomi's scenario.

1761
01:50:34,411 --> 01:50:37,330
The capital and government are in shambles.

1762
01:50:37,664 --> 01:50:40,208
Good opportunity to rebuild it right.

1763
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:46,632
Once relief and reconstruction bills are passed...

1764
01:50:46,923 --> 01:50:50,344
it'll dissolve for general election.

1765
01:50:50,845 --> 01:50:54,640
To resuscitate Japan and 3.6 million metropolitan refugees...

1766
01:50:55,182 --> 01:50:57,476
we'll need a brand new cabinet.

1767
01:51:00,772 --> 01:51:04,567
This country rose up through scrap-and-build.

1768
01:51:07,362 --> 01:51:09,114
It'll be done again.

1769
01:51:32,637 --> 01:51:34,599
The countdown was merely suspended.

1770
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:38,143
But it'll restart when Gojira begins moving.

1771
01:51:38,852 --> 01:51:41,522
3,526 seconds to launch.

1772
01:51:43,066 --> 01:51:45,276
I'm amazed you allowed that.

1773
01:51:45,985 --> 01:51:48,405
I had to keep the world satisfied.

1774
01:51:49,572 --> 01:51:51,950
Now Japan... no...

1775
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:55,161
Mankind, must coexist with Gojira.

1776
01:51:58,164 --> 01:51:59,999
You shared the data with France.

1777
01:52:00,792 --> 01:52:03,586
With France and the whole world.

1778
01:52:03,921 --> 01:52:06,006
I broke a promise, but regret nothing.

1779
01:52:07,382 --> 01:52:10,010
I like your by-any-means approach.

1780
01:52:11,011 --> 01:52:12,138
So...

1781
01:52:13,973 --> 01:52:15,057
you'd better not quit

1782
01:52:18,561 --> 01:52:20,396
When I'm US President,

1783
01:52:20,396 --> 01:52:23,149
you'd be ideal as my Japanese counterpart.

1784
01:52:23,441 --> 01:52:25,484
Your Japanese puppet, you mean.

1785
01:52:27,528 --> 01:52:30,615
The fact remains that casualties were high.

1786
01:52:31,491 --> 01:52:34,119
Accountability comes with the job.

1787
01:52:35,495 --> 01:52:39,124
A politician must decide whether to own it or not.

1788
01:52:42,126 --> 01:52:44,003
I myself choose to own it.

1789
01:52:47,549 --> 01:52:50,427
Well, as Maki said,

1790
01:52:51,387 --> 01:52:53,597
"Do as you like."

1791
01:53:10,323 --> 01:53:12,659
But now's not the time to quit.

1792
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:19,249
Things are still far from settled.
