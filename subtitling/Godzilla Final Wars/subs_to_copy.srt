1
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,691
Godzilla directly ahead! Target lock!

2
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,443
Fire!

3
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,699
Keep to your posts!

4
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,146
- Prepare to launch missiles!
- Preparing missiles!

5
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,294
It's an Earthquake!

6
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,591
Fire into the glacier!

7
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,299
Repeated wars and
environmental disruptions...

8
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,649
As science advanced,
Earth's environment paid the ultimate price.

9
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,999
Giant monsters began to appear.

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,149
A race of mutants, seemingly human,
emerged as mankind's enemies.

11
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:56,120
But later joined forces with
them to fight the monsters.

12
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,200
The Earth Defense Force (EDF) is born.

13
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:06,750
Possessing special physical abilities,
more mutants began to appear.

14
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:13,030
The EDF organized a special military
unit consisting of humans and mutants.

15
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,520
This elite unit is called
Organization-M.

16
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,199
But the greatest enemy of the EDF...

17
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,560
...plunged the world into
a crisis of extinction.

18
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,899
It appeared for the first time in 1954.

19
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,930
It's name is...

20
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,300
We can't maintain this. We must surface!

21
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,143
- Depth is 6700 meters!
- We're already beyond our limit!

22
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,299
Inside temperature now
at 80 degrees Celsius!

23
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,340
Captain!

24
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,070
Temperature now at 90 Celsius!

25
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,220
Captain! We can't take anymore!

26
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,844
Manda in pursuit!

27
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,310
Automatic firing system down!

28
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,190
Manda is terminated.

29
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,300
Ship damage at 72%.

30
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,610
Captain Gordon, were you
planning on sinking the Gotengo?

31
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,520
You can't avoid a court
martial this time.

32
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,980
Enough!

33
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,790
If this was a real fight,
Ozaki would be dead.

34
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,720
Lucky for you this is only an exercise.

35
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,090
Kazama, don't get carried away.

36
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,249
But I won the fight.

37
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,650
Listen, the purpose of training is not
to become stronger than your partner.

38
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,900
Then what's the point?

39
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,370
To become stronger than
you were yesterday.

40
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,499
Okay.

41
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,750
Ozaki...

42
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,399
Come to my quarters later.

43
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,680
Yes, sir!

44
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,770
Attention!

45
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,970
Wait!

46
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,100
Why did you hold back?

47
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:25,390
Were you trying to lose?

48
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,710
No. You won.

49
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,799
Listen,

50
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,591
let me tell you something.

51
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,080
All you need to think about is killing.

52
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,690
You have a heart.
That could be fatal on the battlefield.

53
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,530
How can we defend
people without a heart?

54
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,020
You're too soft.

55
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,160
We're mutants.

56
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,497
We were born to fight.

57
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,289
Our mission is not to defend.

58
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,410
We just fight.

59
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,899
The fossil of an unknown
monster was found in Hokkaido...

60
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,460
...and brought to the Defense Museum.

61
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,370
A biologist is coming from the
United Nations to examine it.

62
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,260
You'll act as a personal security guard.

63
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,420
Is that all?

64
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,299
Yes. It's an easy job.

65
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:41,650
This isn't a job for Organization-M.

66
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,870
The Gotengo is now in dry-dock and under
repairs after the battle with Manda.

67
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,731
Col. Gordon was pissed off at the
conference and hit his superior.

68
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,300
He's in a detention cell.

69
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,310
You need a change of scenery.

70
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:04,340
Anyhow, this biologist from the
UN must be an old, argumentative...

71
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,680
Sorry for being old and argumentative.

72
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,730
This is Ms. Miyuki Otonashi,
a molecular biologist.

73
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,580
Are you really a biologist?
You look more like a model.

74
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,399
I always thought Mutants were dumb
grunts who only know how to fight.

75
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,899
After meeting you,
it seems that I was right.

76
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,999
Yeah, that's true.

77
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,010
It seems there is also a model
who thinks she is a biologist.

78
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,320
First of all, let's get something clear.

79
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,970
What?

80
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,899
Don't interrupt my work.

81
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,460
Don't talk to me except
when I ask you something.

82
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,130
- But I...
- In fact...

83
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,180
Don't even look at me except
when you have business with me.

84
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,780
Babysitting a woman.

85
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,380
A job that suits you.

86
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,050
Try a little harder.

87
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,299
I've studied it thoroughly.\N\N\N\N\N\N

88
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,720
A fusion of machine and an organic life form.\N\N\N\N\N\N

89
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,690
Should I call it a cyborg monster?

90
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:36,980
After a full analysis, I'd say it's
approximately 12,000 years old.

91
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,100
Could such a creation actually
be possible 12,000 years ago?

92
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,100
Not possible.
Not on this planet, at least.

93
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,410
You mean, this monster
came from another planet?

94
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,105
Here, the M-base is detected.

95
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,899
Yes. Human beings are
made up of four components:

96
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:05,280
Adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine.

97
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:10,049
But mutants have a fifth unknown one,

98
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,350
which we call M-base.

99
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,540
M-base is detected in this monster, too.

100
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,580
Mutants didn't suddenly metamorphose....

101
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,660
But are somehow biologically related to
this monster from 12,000 years ago.

102
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:31,700
That means this monster is kind
of an ancestor to you guys.

103
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,180
That's ridiculous.

104
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,649
Do you have any special thoughts,
as the first Japanese UN Secretary General?

105
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,399
I believe the human race has
the ability to solve any problem.\N\N\N\N\N\N

106
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,649
The logic and science that we
brought about and the reason and\N\N\N\N\N\N

107
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,199
courage to solve any mystery
mankind encounters.

108
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,199
For example, the root of life
that is not yet discovered...

109
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,999
and overcome any and
all unknown menaces.

110
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,620
I am strongly convinced
that such a day is upon us.

111
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,499
Mr. Daigo, are you going
to New York after this?

112
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,049
Yes.

113
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,280
I'm traveling so much these days,
I feel as if I were living on an airplane.

114
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,399
It's a pity I don't see Clint
very much these days.

115
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,180
Clint?

116
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,895
He's my dog.

117
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,199
You have a doggy!

118
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,760
He hasn't changed his attitude,
even since I became the Secretary General.

119
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,020
Prof. Jiguji, here it is.

120
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,450
Infant Island?

121
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,549
This...

122
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,600
That monster's name is Gigan.

123
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,760
Where are we?

124
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,390
Welcome to Infant Island.

125
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,780
We have brought you here to tell
you something very important.

126
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,450
Gigan came to this island 12,000 years
ago and caused great destruction.

127
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:46,540
Mothra tried to stop it.

128
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,540
That's what this ancient art depicts.

129
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,990
Gigan is a wicked creature.

130
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:01,060
And its wicked blood
streams down to you.

131
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,170
Me?

132
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:10,800
You have the power to decide
what path you will choose.

133
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,820
As long as you don't become an enemy
to the Earth, Mothra is on your side.

134
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,760
What was that?

135
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,190
Did we all have a hallucination?

136
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,730
No. It wasn't a hallucination.

137
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,230
Please take this.

138
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,510
This is a charm from the
ancient times of this Island.

139
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,649
Mr. Daigo. Here's the
document for the meeting.

140
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,410
Oh, thank you.

141
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,699
New York is under attack by Rodan.
We've deployed Operation Rumbling.

142
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,799
What about Mr. Daigo's plane?

143
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,435
It's still missing.

144
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,044
Commander Namikawa,
Angilas has appeared in Shanghai!

145
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,340
Dispatch Karyu right away!

146
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,010
Commander!

147
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,180
King Caesar has appeared in Okinawa!

148
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,110
Kamacuras is in Paris!

149
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,899
Sydney is under attack!

150
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,510
What on Earth?

151
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,099
Special bulletin.

152
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,599
Monsters have appeared
all over the world.

153
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,543
Don't go out. Stay at home.

154
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,432
Damn armadillo!

155
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,608
Don't let him get away!

156
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,360
Fire missiles!

157
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,920
Fire Maser!

158
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,884
Don't let it get away!

159
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,120
After it!

160
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,699
Who are you?

161
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,110
I'll shoot!

162
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,607
Who do you think I am?

163
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,990
Grandpa, don't shoot him!

164
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,620
It looks scared.

165
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,920
Grandpa!

166
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,850
What's going on here?

167
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:15,960
Damage report!

168
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Captain!

169
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,410
Fire missiles!

170
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,230
Oh, you're a feisty one.

171
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,599
There's an energy plant 1 KM away.

172
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,302
So we'll stop 'em right here!

173
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,999
Ozaki and Kazama form a team.

174
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,849
The rest of you blast
the hell out of him.

175
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,999
Then, while it's preoccupied
with the attack...

176
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,399
Ozaki and Kazama will
shoot it with the masers.

177
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,699
Let's have fried shrimp for dinner!

178
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,699
Roger!

179
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,699
Go!

180
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,330
Fire!

181
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,750
We've got it now.

182
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,899
What the hell is happening?

183
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,299
A UFO in Paris!
Kamacuras has disappeared!

184
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,649
Also in Okinawa!
King Caesar has disappeared!

185
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:03,834
- Kumonga as well!
- All the monsters are disappearing!

186
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,818
The flying objects are gathering.

187
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,849
What's the projected target area?

188
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,320
Point 0.0.

189
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,849
Above headquarters.

190
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:17,849
Right here!

191
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,585
Commander, you're in danger here.

192
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,810
I don't care.
The danger is the same everywhere.

193
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,130
Secretary General Daigo!

194
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,100
What's happening here?

195
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,248
I was in danger.

196
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,532
They rescued me.

197
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,730
Who are they?

198
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,655
Yes, my friends from outer space.

199
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,800
You mean, extraterrestrials?

200
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,630
They aren't hostile.

201
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,480
A new door is opening for mankind.

202
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,034
We are all about to bear
witness to an historic moment.

203
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,240
Greetings.

204
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,710
Nice to meet you.

205
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,780
We come in peace.

206
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,580
How do we know that?

207
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:49,099
We eliminated the monsters for you.
We could have attacked you instead.

208
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,399
We come from a place far
beyond your solar system.

209
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,160
Our intentions are peaceful.

210
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,399
Earthlings cannot pronounce
the name of our star.

211
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,530
So, you can call it Planet X.

212
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,540
What is your purpose here?

213
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,400
A crisis approaches the Earth.

214
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,000
A huge planet will soon
collide with your planet.

215
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:25,549
It will collide with the
Earth in 11,736 hours,

216
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,749
17 minutes and
32 seconds from now.

217
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:34,580
31, 30, 29...
Every second it draws closer.

218
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,124
Planet Gorath.

219
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,370
There is only one way to stop
Gorath from destroying your planet.

220
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,720
With our help, you must gather all of
Earth's armaments in one place and attack.

221
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,690
We calculated the exact time and place.

222
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,195
This...

223
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:03,724
is a great opportunity for us...

224
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:10,664
to advance in ways we
never imagined possible.

225
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,049
With their help...

226
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:18,500
we can learn limitless new
science, technology and medicine.

227
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,010
And the universe will be united.

228
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,310
The days of the United
Nations are now over.

229
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,650
This is the beginning
of the Space Nations!

230
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,849
We're in the square looking at the UFO.

231
00:34:57,850 --> 00:35:02,699
We can't get any closer because it's
strictly guarded by the Defense Force.

232
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,420
But look...

233
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,699
A large number of people continue
flocking here day after day,

234
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,099
to have a look at the Xiliens.

235
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,470
The aura of enthusiasm is increasing!

236
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,849
Today's guest is... not Kenji Kohashi,
because he's changed his name.

237
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,399
X.

238
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,699
- "X"?
- That's right.

239
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,549
What do you mean by "X"?

240
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,660
I renamed myself.
So everyone call me X from now on.

241
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:34,149
I decided to call myself X to prompt the
collaboration between Earth and Planet X.

242
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,899
It's a collaboration across space,
galaxies, the universe, black holes and--

243
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,999
Okay, okay, okay, we got it, Kenji.

244
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,149
I see what you mean.
That suits you really well.

245
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,020
- Yeah, it does.
- It sure does!

246
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,949
For the past few days now, the Xilien have
been living amongst us here on Earth.

247
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:00,499
Now we want to get reactions
from our celebrity panelists.

248
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,749
First, how about you, Mr. Otsuki?

249
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,799
Well, I can't understand the hype.

250
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,890
The media are to blame, all this stuff
about aliens and outer space...

251
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,895
Look you can't deny what's happening!

252
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:16,399
You've always denied the existence of aliens,
we all remember, and now they're with us.

253
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,699
- That's true.
- Admit you're wrong.

254
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,599
There's nothing to prove that these men,
the aliens, are in fact extraterrestrials.

255
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,349
There's no scientific proof at all.

256
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:30,949
Who cares if there's proof or not, I think the
most important thing is to keep the dream alive.

257
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,949
It's so cool.

258
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:35,099
- All these guys saying they're aliens....
- I think the young lady's right,

259
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:38,449
- at least we get a good laugh.
- That isn't what I mean.

260
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,899
Listen, I think we need to have
closer contact with the aliens.

261
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,799
Of course, I don't mean we should
start laying into them or anything,

262
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,999
just learn as much from them
as we can, don't you think?

263
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,449
- I agree.
- Well there's one thing for sure,

264
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,199
they're here and there's
nothing we can do about it.

265
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,099
There was a time when you also denied
their existance, I wasn't the only one.

266
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,149
Or had you forgotten?

267
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:01,599
Alright, I may have said that.
But they're here now, aren't they?

268
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,699
I'm not going to deny what's
in front of my eyes, alright?

269
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:07,899
Well, I'm sorry to say, that in time,
you're going to be proved wrong.

270
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,137
I seriously doubt--

271
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,899
I really don't know what
to think about all this.

272
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,450
Just when we find out about Gigan's origins,
our Xilien friends show up.

273
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,949
Well that doesn't mean there's a
connection between Gigan and Planet X.

274
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,050
We don't have any proof, do we?

275
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,270
You need proof, do you?

276
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,199
Sister!

277
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,610
Anna Otonashi! She's your sister!?

278
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,499
You look good, Miyuki.

279
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,366
And you have a cute boyfriend!

280
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,450
Him? He's not my boyfriend.

281
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,650
So what proof do you have?

282
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,560
Look carefully.

283
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,970
Yes, there's something wrong.

284
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,370
I don't know what, but he's weird.

285
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,920
Notice something unusual?

286
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,190
He's not blinking.

287
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,990
It's impossible for a
human not to blink.

288
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,530
Anyway, let's pay him a visit.

289
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,650
Nice to see you again.

290
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,410
Mr. Daigo.

291
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,690
Long time no see
Secretary General Daigo.

292
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,249
Who are you?

293
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,299
I'm Anna Otonashi of Nitto TV.

294
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,999
I'm in a hurry, what can I do for you?

295
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,599
I think your idea about the
space alliance is brilliant.

296
00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:00,299
I'd like to pass the message to all
the world through our TV program.

297
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,749
Okay, I'll get back to you.

298
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,099
Soon, if possible!

299
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,549
I don't have any time now.

300
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,399
How's your doggy?

301
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,770
Doggy?

302
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,599
Yes, your dog.

303
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,100
Oh, my dog...

304
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,899
Traitor! You're a disgrace!
Alien lacky! You traitor!

305
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,149
Kill that man!
Kill him before it's too late!

306
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:33,399
Kill the traitor or the
Earth'll be destroyed!

307
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,817
We're going to be annihilated!
You have to believe me!

308
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,100
Mr. Daigo, you're bleeding!

309
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,499
Are you all right?
You should see a doctor.

310
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,099
It's no big deal.

311
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,599
You should get emergency first aid...

312
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,080
I said I'm fine!

313
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,550
Miyuki...

314
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,799
...look.

315
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,499
This... is not the blood
of a human being!

316
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,749
I thought so...

317
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,549
There is no creature on Earth
with this blood composition.

318
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,090
Daigo must be an Xilien.

319
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,850
May I come in?

320
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,520
I'm Ensign Ozaki.

321
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,749
At ease.

322
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,049
What is it?

323
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:41,110
Yes. This is about Mr. Daigo.

324
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:48,730
Since he returned, he has become a
major activist for the Space Nations.

325
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,310
There's a problem?

326
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,349
Yes, there has already been
one attempt on his life.

327
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:08,199
I think that we should increase
security in order to protect him.

328
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,650
I'm aware of all this. You may go.

329
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,140
Yes, ma'am. Excuse me.

330
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,060
What is it you want to say?

331
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,380
We have all these monsters and can
annihilate these people whenever we want.

332
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,699
Why are we wasting time like this?

333
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,780
You're still young.

334
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,510
Not every situation is
to be settled by force.

335
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:47,030
Sometimes things can
be handled peacefully.

336
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,699
However, if we use our power...

337
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,070
Silence!

338
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,570
You may go.

339
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,570
One who relies on power will
eventually fall to a stronger power.

340
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,750
Remember that.

341
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:17,080
These pictures came from the same time,
but from a completely different place.

342
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,799
They look exactly the same.

343
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,520
Yes, they are the same.

344
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,600
When I put these photos on top of each
other, there was no difference at all.

345
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,240
This can't be possible.
This must be some kind of holograph.

346
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,550
You mean, Gorath doesn't exist?

347
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,299
The Xiliens have been
fooling us from the start.

348
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:46,299
Mr. Daigo is an alien, so is
Commander Namikawa...

349
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:50,290
Those two have been
replaced by the Xiliens?

350
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,800
We can't trust anyone.

351
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,530
There is one person we can trust.

352
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,300
Someone I know Xiliens
haven't gotten to.

353
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,810
Captain Gordon.

354
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:35,150
What do you mean by that?

355
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,099
Hello everyone.

356
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:48,380
We're broadcasting live
from the UN building.

357
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,990
We have Secretary General Daigo
and two X representatives with us.

358
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,100
Thank you for coming.

359
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,680
What are you doing
with Mr. Daigo's data?

360
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,090
You've become quite inquisitive lately.

361
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,180
Major General Kunikida.

362
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,599
If you poke around too much,

363
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,099
you'll find out things you're
not supposed to know.

364
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,579
What are you going to do with me,

365
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,550
Ms. Xilien?

366
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,470
If you know that much,
then you must die.

367
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:55,130
You finally show your true colors.

368
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,060
Damned humans...

369
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:13,950
We won't have our plans disrupted
by such lowly creatures like you!

370
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,610
Are you all right?

371
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,090
Are you?

372
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,290
I'm okay.

373
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,730
Mr. Daigo, we have a
surprise visitor today.

374
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,520
Oh, who is that?

375
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,640
What? Have you forgotten?

376
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,770
Oh, that's right! That's my dog!

377
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,110
Go and say hello to Mr. Daigo.

378
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:34,450
Mr. Daigo, please call his name.
He'll be very happy.

379
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:37,520
His name?

380
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,590
Have you forgotten his name?

381
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,570
Poor thing...

382
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,460
Young lady, please tell
Mr. Daigo the dog's name.

383
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:59,300
The name of Mr. Daigo's dog is... Clint.

384
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,730
Yes, that's right! Clint!

385
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,674
Come here, Clint.
Come over here. Come, come.

386
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,999
Good boy, good boy.

387
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,774
How are you, Clint?

388
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,000
What's the matter?

389
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,561
He doesn't seem to be in a good mood
since I haven't seen him for a long time.

390
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:29,540
Candy. Come here, Candy!

391
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,899
In fact there was no way you could
have known this dog's name,

392
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,500
cause you see, this dog belongs to me.

393
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:41,180
But you... you said it was...

394
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:46,000
You didn't listen. I never said
that this dog belonged to you.

395
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
In your box.

396
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:02,000
Very interesting.

397
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:05,960
So, what's your point?

398
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,199
Look at this!

399
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,400
This is what an Xilien
really looks like!

400
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,400
Please explain this!

401
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,082
Well...

402
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,770
You see, it's like this...

403
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:32,710
The ruse is over.

404
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,660
From now on, I'm in charge of things.

405
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,440
Earthlings...

406
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,550
your history stops here.

407
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:45,868
From now on,

408
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
you're cattle.

409
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,980
Your one and only function
is to be our food supply.

410
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,670
Not bad for cattle.

411
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,299
It is useless to resist us.

412
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:21,070
Both our science and weaponry
are superior to yours.

413
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,680
We have all the monsters
under our control as well.

414
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,120
You don't have a chance.

415
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:52,390
Wait.

416
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,449
Stupid domesticated animals.

417
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:01,160
You have no idea what you're up against.

418
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,550
What? What's wrong?

419
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,640
Kazama!

420
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,837
Damn you.

421
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,130
You're also a Mutant.

422
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,300
I leave this for you.

423
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,030
Get out of here. I'll hold them off.

424
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:32,410
Don't you see,
they're going to need you!

425
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:40,220
Save the Earth, Captain.

426
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,020
Run!

427
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:31,060
Ozaki?

428
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:22,899
Gigan...!

429
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,900
awaken!

430
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,460
Release all of the monsters!

431
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,420
Make these savages feel like the
domesticated animals they are.

432
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,200
This is our playground.

433
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,980
Destroy their civilization completely!

434
00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:37,890
Don't give up! Fight until the last breath!

435
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,849
Captain! It's Anguirus!

436
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,930
What the!?

437
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,340
Their long-cherished civilization
will be wiped out in a moment.

438
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:17,210
The poor humans, it's almost sad.

439
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,910
Useless.

440
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,699
Now what? Kenta, let's go!

441
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,599
By the way, what's his name?

442
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,930
Minilla. His name is Minilla.

443
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,370
Minilla? Whatever. Let's go, Kenta.
Come on, Minilla.

444
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,899
All our forces have been wiped out.

445
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,970
Up to now, we've been lucky.
They haven't found our underground HQ.

446
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,999
How about repairs? Is it fixed yet?

447
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,490
Yes. the repairs are all finished.
Gotengo is the only thing we have left.

448
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,730
You shouldn't move for a while.

449
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,490
Ozaki...

450
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:51,250
why didn't you kill me?

451
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,640
Because we're a team.

452
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:10,799
They'll find this place sooner or later!
We need to go on the offensive!

453
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:16,021
Ozaki, don't become emotional.
Gotengo is our last hope.

454
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,700
The South Pole?

455
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,550
Area G...

456
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,040
You want to awaken Godzilla?

457
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:45,190
It's too dangerous.
It might destroy the whole world.

458
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:51,099
But what if they control Godzilla too?

459
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,090
That's all right.
Godzilla doesn't have M-base.

460
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:01,599
All the Xiliens, Gigan
and part of Ebirah

461
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,649
which was stuck to
Kazama's body have M-base.

462
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:07,690
And of course, all the Mutants, too.

463
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,649
That's right.

464
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:17,649
The Xiliens must have manipulated...

465
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,510
...or rebuilt the gene structure
of the monsters to control them.

466
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:24,112
Then why wasn't I affected?

467
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:27,701
You're not controlled.
That's the important thing.

468
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,880
If we use Godzilla to
destroy the enemy...

469
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:44,280
how do we deal with
him afterwards?

470
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,990
It's not that easy...

471
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,300
So, what you're saying is...

472
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,899
We fight our way to the South Pole,

473
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:42,899
wake up Godzilla, bring him here
and make him fight the monsters.

474
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:49,040
Meanwhile, one way or another,
we'll annihilate the Xiliens somehow.

475
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:53,170
Then we go back to the South
Pole and confine Godzilla again?

476
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,500
Understood.

477
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,920
Miyuki, be careful.

478
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,690
You too, sis.

479
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,310
Please come back alive and well.

480
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,999
Alpha system checked.

481
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,898
Beta system checked.

482
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:10,908
Ready for takeoff.

483
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,230
Well, there's still an
interesting toy left.

484
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,580
Gigan, go.

485
01:07:53,850 --> 01:07:56,180
Captain, Gigan approaching!

486
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:09,450
Captain!

487
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:38,500
Main engine dead!
Power circuits have cut off!

488
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:50,100
Fire missiles!

489
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,100
What is that monster?

490
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:13,950
It'll be a pleasure to deal with you.
Meanwhile, your Godzilla can deal with...

491
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:16,150
This!

492
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,200
Here he comes!

493
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,900
Repairs completed!

494
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:30,550
Start engines!

495
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:56,300
Godzilla is following us.

496
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,800
Damn it.

497
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,700
I have no idea where we are.

498
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,212
Godzilla,

499
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:37,700
show me what you got.

500
01:13:20,350 --> 01:13:23,150
I knew that tuna-eating
monster was useless!

501
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,700
Next!

502
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:35,300
So Earth actually posesses
such a stong creature.

503
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,300
Interesting.

504
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,400
Why is Godzilla destroying that town?

505
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:52,099
Long before you were born,
humans did a terrible thing...

506
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,300
and made Godzilla very angry.

507
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:57,350
- A terrible thing?
- Yes.

508
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,000
You're too young to understand yet...

509
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:06,800
but humans made a huge fire
that cause much destruction.

510
01:16:07,100 --> 01:16:11,400
That's why Godzilla can
not forgive mankind.

511
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,099
What's the matter?

512
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:24,000
Hey, what's wrong?

513
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,200
What are you doing?

514
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:46,450
Are you okay?

515
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:55,849
All my studies,

516
01:16:55,850 --> 01:17:00,064
they've been totally useless.
What was the point of it all?

517
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,700
You decide how to use your power,
whether it's for good or evil.

518
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:22,596
Your knowledge will be invaluable...

519
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:26,693
once this battle is over.

520
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,747
Wait,

521
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:38,350
tell me what makes
you go on fighting...

522
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:44,800
even when you don't have
any chance... of winning?

523
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:52,050
I was assigned to protect you.
That's my job.

524
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:02,800
Hey, Minilla, where are we going?

525
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,200
Don't touch!

526
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,300
Now what will you do, Godzilla?

527
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,400
What are you doing?

528
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:01,050
What's the matter, Minilla?

529
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,800
They're here at last.

530
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,000
Firing Maser!

531
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:39,400
One of the jet fighters have launched.

532
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,100
I owe you a debt.

533
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:49,900
What are you doing?

534
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,000
It's suicide!

535
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:56,300
Wait!

536
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:52,500
I leave the rest to you, Ozaki.

537
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,400
Stop! Kazama!

538
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:09,600
What arrogant cattle.
How dare you drill your master's ship.

539
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,000
Kill the rest of them.

540
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,800
I have other plans for you.

541
01:25:27,950 --> 01:25:28,950
Bring them here.

542
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,600
Just a moment.

543
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:36,000
It's no good.

544
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:14,950
Earthlings, I hope you
understand our power now.

545
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:29,000
We must take a certain mitochondria
from your cells to survive.

546
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:35,100
In other words,
we must harvest you alive.

547
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:37,800
Harvest us alive?

548
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:44,149
At first, we destroyed your civilization so
that you didn't realize our true intentions.

549
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:46,550
We will be harvesting a new crop soon.

550
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,399
You can live here as cattle on a farm.

551
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,700
This is our ranch and you are
the animals awaiting slaughter.

552
01:27:57,800 --> 01:27:59,400
Stop with that nonsense.

553
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:03,800
You don't need civilization
and science anymore.

554
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:08,700
You only used your knowledge
to destroy things in any case.

555
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:13,600
But we'll control you so you won't
wreck anymore havok on this planet.

556
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:19,500
Well now let's enjoy the main event!

557
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,900
The last chapter in the Godzilla saga.

558
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,900
Is that all your Godzilla can do?

559
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,150
Here comes another one.

560
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:10,200
Let's see what it can do
against the upgraded Gigan!

561
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:18,600
Why don't you kill us?

562
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:21,700
Why should we kill our brothers?

563
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,500
Brothers?

564
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:27,999
Xiliens and Mutants are
one and the same?

565
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,700
M-base was also discovered
in Xilien blood.

566
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:33,699
You're almost right.

567
01:32:33,700 --> 01:32:36,925
M-base is quite
abundant on our planet.

568
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,900
And M-base levels affects the
level of telepathic ability.

569
01:32:42,150 --> 01:32:46,099
And that's why you can control
the Gigan and Mutants, right?

570
01:32:46,100 --> 01:32:48,100
You're pretty smart for an Earthling.

571
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:54,700
You see the Mutants here on Earth are
in fact are our interbred ancestors.

572
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,300
So how come you couldn't control me?

573
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:03,600
You're special.
Your power has yet to awaken.

574
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,300
What?

575
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:08,050
You're a Keizer.

576
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:12,949
A Mutant whose M-Base combined
with human DNA has a one in

577
01:33:12,950 --> 01:33:16,999
a million chance of becoming
an all powerful super being.

578
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:22,200
It so happens that both of us are...

579
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,400
Keizers.

580
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,649
You have powers that surpass
those of any humans or

581
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:35,099
Xiliens but instead you
prefer to live with cattle.

582
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:10,500
Ozaki!

583
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:14,200
Wake up, Keizer!

584
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:33,550
Keizer, slaughter these cattle.

585
01:34:44,050 --> 01:34:45,350
No! Don't!

586
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:03,400
I...

587
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:10,840
Such a pity.

588
01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:14,003
And I had such high hopes for you.

589
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:39,900
Your four, keep an eye on the other.

590
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,900
This is our planet.

591
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,500
Secretary General Daigo!

592
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,000
Ms. Otonashi!

593
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,700
You're alive!

594
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:24,900
We were very lucky. 
We managed to get away.

595
01:40:28,200 --> 01:40:29,899
"Mr. Bullseye".

596
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,900
That's what they called
me in military college.

597
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:40,300
Captain, take the others
back to the ship.

598
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:43,100
I've got business to finish.

599
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:13,049
But...

600
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,799
Use this.

601
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:05,950
You'd hit a woman?

602
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:33,850
I told you...

603
01:43:34,500 --> 01:43:38,727
your kind exist only to serve us.

604
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:41,549
You're just cattle.

605
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:00,000
You're forgetting I have a choice.

606
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:11,300
I decide how to use my powers, 
whether for good or evil.

607
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,000
We are not cattle.

608
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,000
We're humans.

609
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:22,846
You have the power to master the
entire the entire universe...

610
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:25,900
and yet you side with cows!

611
01:46:19,700 --> 01:46:22,000
I won't die alone!

612
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:29,500
The ship's self-destructing!

613
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:46,200
- She's hit!
- Commander!

614
01:47:14,150 --> 01:47:15,150
Let's go!

615
01:47:54,100 --> 01:47:55,100
I'm hurt...

616
01:47:57,550 --> 01:48:00,950
Take the controls! Quick!

617
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:08,300
Pull it back all the way!

618
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:24,600
It's sucking the life
force out of Godzilla.

619
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:27,649
We got to hurry.

620
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:30,050
Somehow we've got to give
Godzilla more energy.

621
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:37,000
All systems have shut down.

622
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,700
Look, what's that!?

623
01:56:48,100 --> 01:56:50,999
Godzilla...

624
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,999
it's over...

625
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,099
You must forgive.

626
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:04,900
Damn you!

627
01:57:09,150 --> 01:57:11,650
What? Move!

628
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:30,400
Minilla!

629
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:10,400
Welcome back!

630
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:44,100
Finally... It's over at last.

631
01:59:46,300 --> 01:59:50,599
No, it's not over...

632
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,600
it's just a new beginning.
