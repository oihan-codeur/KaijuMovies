00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,370
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,090
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:49,020
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,770
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,240
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,070
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,660
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,660
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,340
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,220
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,090
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,680
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,680
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,060
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,230
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,070
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,900
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,160
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,040
So, bring it on!

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,560
<i>The curtain rises on an</i>
<i>unprecedented Tenkaichi Tournament</i>

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,930
<i>with Trunks' victory in the Junior Division.</i>

26
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,610
<i>But then...</i>

27
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,240
Good day. You are Son Goku-<i>san</i>, are you not?

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,200
I have wanted to try my
hand against you in a match.

29
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,450
I too have managed to
get past the preliminaries.

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,500
Ah, good to meet you.

31
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,510
<i>Two men unexpectedly appear</i>
<i>before Son Goku and the Z Warriors,</i>

32
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,430
<i>who were expecting they would have easy wins.</i>

33
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,600
<i>Who are these men? What is their power?</i>

34
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,110
<i>"Event Match-ups Decided!!</i>
<i>Let's Hurry and Hold the First Round."</i>

35
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,380
They aren't of Earth, those two.

36
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,840
Nope.

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,810
I have no idea who they might be.

38
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:35,020
Why would off-worlder
beings be in a place like this?

39
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,860
Say, what does he mean? "Aren't of the Earth"?

40
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,360
Ah, that person, see, he's a little bit funny.

41
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,370
You're right. Come to think
of it, he looks a little pale.

42
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,620
No matter, no matter, let's hurry!

43
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,910
The Tournament's drawing is about to start!

44
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,000
Y-Yeah.

45
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,340
Damn.

46
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,680
That kid Trunks, or whatever...
I even told him how lightly to do it.

47
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,820
Hey, Goten! Come look at this!

48
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,200
Hmm? What?

49
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,370
Look at that guy! The one with the mask on!

50
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,120
That's a strange mask all right!

51
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,540
This area is one where only
people who have qualified

52
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,790
in the preliminaries can enter.

53
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,800
That means he's one of them!

54
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,220
How about it? Don't you think we can use him?

55
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,300
In that outfit, no one would
know if we were inside! Probably.

56
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,720
How do you mean?

57
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,390
Don't you get it?

58
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,230
Put simply, we give him a good chop,
and while he's out, we take his clothes.

59
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,730
Then we pretend to be him,
and participate in the matches!

60
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,110
No way, we couldn't do something like that!

61
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,110
You say such ridiculous things, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,070
What's the matter?

63
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,370
Don't you want to try matching
up against the grown-ups?

64
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,040
W-Well, sure I'd like to try, but...

65
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,950
Don'cha?! Okay, it's settled then!

66
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,000
H-Hold on!

67
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,630
Um...

68
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,760
What is it? You want an autograph, little boy?

69
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,340
There's a pretty young lady over
there who says she wants to talk to you.

70
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,760
What?!

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,390
She's too embarrassed, so she
asked me to come get you for her.

72
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,600
R-Really? Where is she?

73
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,020
This way, this way.

74
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,610
Where, where? Is she really pretty?

75
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,450
Just so you know, I'm pretty
fussy about that. Where, where?

76
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,960
All right!

77
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,130
Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

78
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:11,050
Give me a hand here, Goten.

79
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,640
We did it! We did it!

80
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,730
Hey, let's get his clothes off.

81
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,320
I put this on?

82
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,320
Yeah.

83
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,370
Yeah, but aren't I too small?
Won't that give us away?

84
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,030
You're such a fool.

85
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,830
Both of us wear it together! Both of us!

86
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,870
Huh? Both of us?

87
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,310
You don't think anyone can tell like this?

88
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,230
Fool! There's no way anyone can tell!

89
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,700
All right! This is perfect!
There's no way anyone can tell!

90
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,240
I don't know...

91
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,250
The drawing is about to start!

92
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,080
Yes, I'm going now!

93
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,090
Right?

94
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,090
Yeah.

95
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,710
All right, I'll be right back!

96
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,470
H-Hey, the other way,
the other way! Not this way!

97
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,770
You know, I can't see in front of me!

98
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,100
So just poke some holes!

99
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,440
You're right!

100
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,770
Now we're perfect!

101
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,070
So there's 16 contestants appearing?

102
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,240
I wonder what kind of opponents there'll be.

103
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,410
Oh well, I don't expect
there will be anyone that great.

104
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,950
Ah, you're here, you're here!

105
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,300
So, have all the entrants come together yet?

106
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,090
Well then, let's call Mister Satan in.

107
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,430
Mister Satan is having a rest.

108
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,260
He said to have his drawing done for him.

109
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,720
Really? Well, that's what we'll do then.

110
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,270
Right, everyone, we will now hold the
drawing to determine your match order!

111
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,480
When your name is called, please
come and draw one of these lots.

112
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:37,280
Kami-<i>sama</i>, I plead with you!

113
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,280
Please don't let me face one
of these guys in the first round!

114
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,120
Kuririn, when you say Kami-<i>sama</i>, it's Dende!

115
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,330
Ah, that's right! But that's okay!

116
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,660
Kami-<i>sama</i>! Dende-<i>sama</i>!

117
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,350
Except for those two, there ain't
anyone else that seems all that great.

118
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:17,730
What's with them? Those two
have a sinister look about them!

119
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,650
It's like they've over-pumped-up!

120
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,700
Wha–?

121
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,000
Th-That guy is a contestant?
He sure does have an unusual build!

122
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,880
So then, I will be calling you
in Japanese alphabetical order.

123
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,210
Um, Killa-<i>san...</i>

124
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,390
Number 14.

125
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,230
Right, Killa-<i>san</i> is number 14.

126
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,020
Contestant Killa, number 14!

127
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,730
Contestant Killa, number 14!

128
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:07,620
Oh! The match-ups for the
first round are underway!

129
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,250
Next is Contestant Kibit, if you please?

130
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,430
Um, number 7.

131
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,970
Contestant Kibit, number 7!

132
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,230
Next is Contestant Kuririn.

133
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:39,270
Oh, me?

134
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,110
Please, let this be a good number.

135
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,460
Number 1! You mean my
match is right off the bat?

136
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,420
Next, Contestant Great Saiyaman!

137
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,460
Right!

138
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,640
Number 8.

139
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,470
Ah, so that guy who just...

140
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,310
You'd better not let your guard down.

141
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,610
I don't think he's your average guy.

142
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,610
Ah, right.

143
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,280
He sure doesn't seem so.

144
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,160
Next is, er, Contestant No. 18.

145
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,960
So, what is your name?

146
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,540
Something like that
doesn't really matter, does it?

147
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,220
Number 9.

148
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,520
Contestant Shin!

149
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,350
Yes.

150
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,110
Number 3.

151
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:13,330
<i>Shin, huh? That's a name</i>
<i>I've never heard before, all right.</i>

152
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,740
We are continuing the drawing now.

153
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,400
When your name is called,
please come immediately.

154
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,490
Hey, Goten, what was the name of this guy?

155
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:57,660
I wouldn't know something like that!

156
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,410
Next, Contestant Spopovitch, if you please?

157
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,420
Er...

158
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,420
Contestant Spopovitch! If you would?

159
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:13,100
Hey, there's no answer!
Could he be this Spopovitch?

160
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,100
That's it, it has to be!

161
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,520
Hurry, let's go!

162
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,680
Yeah.

163
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,690
Spopovitch-<i>san</i>!

164
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:25,060
Yes! I'm coming now!

165
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,700
I wonder what I'll get...

166
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,580
Hmm? You're Mighty Mask-<i>san</i>, aren't you?

167
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,080
Move it!

168
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,130
I'm Spopovitch!

169
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,460
Ah, pardon.

170
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,630
Ow, ow ow!

171
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,430
I-Idiot! Now you've embarrassed us!
What do you think you're doing?

172
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:00,140
What do you mean?
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, you said so, didn't you?

173
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,650
Spopovitch-<i>san</i>, you've
changed quite a bit from before.

174
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,610
I didn't realize it was you.

175
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,450
Eh, number 6.

176
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,080
Damn. If only that abnormal-looking
jerk had answered sooner!

177
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,870
Next is Contestant Jewel.

178
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:31,010
Number 16.

179
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,340
Right. Contestant Jewel is number 16.

180
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,310
Oh, it's Jewel!

181
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,640
He's the Champion from my city!

182
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,640
He's really strong! He'll win for sure!

183
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,230
Fool! There's no way he
can win against Mister Satan!

184
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,120
Goku-<i>sa</i> is still to come?

185
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,620
He's just gotta be victorious
for me, no matter what!

186
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,330
Well, victory's a matter
of the luck of the moment.

187
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,620
Vegeta an' Piccolo are here too, ya know.

188
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:08,000
Pa! This is no time for
you to be talkin' like that!

189
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,170
Our whole livin' depends on it!

190
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:15,010
Goten had his victory taken
away from him by Trunks' dirty tricks!

191
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:21,640
That's why Goku-sa has to win at any
cost, an' bring home that prize money.

192
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,640
Our family's finances are already so hard up,

193
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,480
our "wheel of fire" is about to have a flat!

194
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,690
Next, Son Goku-<i>san</i>!

195
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,230
So, it's my turn! All right!

196
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,620
I wonder what number it'll be...

197
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,580
Number 11.

198
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,960
My opponent ain't been decided yet, huh?

199
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,960
Wonder who it'll be.

200
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,430
Next, Videl-<i>san</i>!

201
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,970
Yes!

202
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,640
What's the matter with Papa?

203
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,560
Er, Mister Satan is having a rest.

204
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,030
Number 5!

205
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,410
H-Hey, when she says Papa–you
mean she's Mister Satan's daughter?

206
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,240
Y-Yeah, that's right.

207
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,200
Ohh? I'd heard stories
about him having a daughter,

208
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,460
but they look nothing alike.
She's pretty cute, after all.

209
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,040
W-Well, I guess so.

210
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,710
If you thrill her just a little bit,

211
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,590
I bet you could get her to
marry you in a second, Gohan!

212
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,630
H-How can you?! We're not
even really seeing each other!

213
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,050
Well, not to worry, not to worry...

214
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:45,140
Contestant Punter, number 2.

215
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,440
All right! He's going to be my opponent!

216
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,780
Are you this Kuririn guy?

217
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,780
Oh, yeah I am.

218
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,830
I don't show any mercy, even to refuse like you!

219
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm gonna pound you to a soft pulp!

220
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,620
Ah, what a shame!

221
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,840
Any way you look at it, that's the line
of a weak guy posing as a strong one.

222
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,340
Your abilities are already obvious.

223
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,800
W-What did you say?!

224
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,630
Why you... You're likely going to die!

225
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,430
Better write out a will now, while you still can!

226
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,020
Better prepare a coffin, too!
I'm going to make yours a flashy funeral!

227
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:32,020
Next, Contestant Vegeta.

228
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,950
Number 12.

229
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,790
Vegeta is number 12?!

230
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,790
Number 12, Contestant Vegeta.

231
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,960
H-Hey! Goku and Vegeta right from the get-go?!

232
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,970
Vegeta, huh?

233
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,800
<i>All right! Kakarrot is my opponent!</i>

234
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,060
<i>I've been waiting for this!</i>
<i>How I've waited for this moment!</i>

235
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,810
<i>The day I am victorious over Kakarrot!</i>

236
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,690
Hey! Both our dads are
in the same fight together!

237
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,400
Which do you think will win?

238
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,820
My father is going to win, for sure!

239
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,820
Fool! My Papa is a sure thing!
And your dad's dead, isn't he?

240
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,410
He might be dead,

241
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,370
but Big Brother says he's
been training in the Other World.

242
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,830
Mighty Mask-<i>san</i>! Mighty Mask-<i>san</i>!
I've been calling for some time.

243
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,460
Ah, pardon me!

244
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,380
Please, hurry and draw.

245
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,630
Right.

246
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,010
Number 13.

247
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,890
Has Mighty Mask always been so high-torsoed?

248
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,930
Next, Contestant Ma Junior.

249
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,110
Number 4.

250
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm against him!

251
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,070
<i>Fine. Maybe I can find out</i>
<i>something about who he is.</i>

252
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:13,080
Next is the Champion, Mister Satan's turn.

253
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,920
Owing to his instructions,
I will draw his lot in his place.

254
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,800
Mister Satan is number 10!

255
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,760
Hey, they said your opponent is Mister Satan!

256
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,390
Who is Mister Satan?

257
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,390
This isn't your day, is it?

258
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,020
For you to be up against Papa right away...

259
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:41,150
Finally, Contestant Yamu.

260
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,780
Right! As expected, number 15.

261
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,280
All right! This is how it's been decided!

262
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,920
The first match will be Contestant
Kuririn vs. Contestant Punter.

263
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,340
The second match will be Contestant
Shin vs. Contestant Ma Junior.

264
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,340
The third match will be Contestant
Videl vs. Contestant Spopovitch.

265
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,300
The fourth match will be Contestant
Kibit vs. Contestant Great Saiyaman.

266
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,760
The fifth match will be Contestant
No. 18 vs. Contestant Mister Satan.

267
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,310
The sixth match will be Contestant
Son Goku vs. Contestant Vegeta.

268
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,940
The seventh match will be Contestant
Mighty Mask vs. Contestant Killa.

269
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,730
The eighth match will be
Contestant Yamu vs. Contestant Jewel.

270
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,990
The matches will begin right away.

271
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,780
I will lead you from here into the waiting room.

272
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,330
Everyone knows the rules, I'm sure.

273
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,700
Giving up, going down and having 10 counted,

274
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,790
falling out of the ring, called the Bubutai,

275
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,960
and killing your opponent will result in defeat.

276
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,800
Also, since we are holding so many matches,

277
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,970
there is a 30-minute time limit on each match.

278
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,890
If after 30 minutes has passed
and the match has yet to be decided,

279
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,560
a judgement will be imposed by the referee.

280
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,100
So now there's a time limit.

281
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,860
For you, just 10 seconds will be plenty!

282
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,320
I know, I know...

283
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,910
Hmm, the 5th match, huh? Who's my opponent?

284
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:16,080
I don't know anything about her,
but she's a sharp-looking woman!

285
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:24,540
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize terribly for the delay.

286
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,760
It's been too long!
So, shall we get slightly rowdy?

287
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,930
And so, we're ready to
convene the Tenkaichi Tournament!

288
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,180
<i>An unprecedented Tenkaichi Tournament,</i>

289
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,770
<i>with a membership unlike any other in history.</i>

290
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:26,150
<i>The Senior Division is about to begin.</i>

291
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,320
<i>Incredible battles seem ready to unfold!</i>

292
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,820
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

293
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,410
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

294
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:55,970
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

295
00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

296
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:09,110
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

297
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,490
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

298
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,370
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

299
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:27,420
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

300
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,960
<i>Even now?</i>

301
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,590
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

302
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,970
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

303
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:48,480
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

304
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:58,530
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

305
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,630
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

306
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:19,470
<i>The first round is a match between</i>
<i>Piccolo and that strange man Shin.</i>

307
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,390
<i>We should find out a little more about him.</i>

308
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,890
<i>Hey, this is strange.</i>

309
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,520
<i>Piccolo is just looking at Shin,</i>
<i>and not even moving!</i>

310
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,730
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

311
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,940
<i>"What's the Matter, Piccolo!?</i>
<i>An Unheard-of No-Fight-Forfeit."</i>

312
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,570
<i>To think that Piccolo-san</i>
<i>is powerless against him...!</i>

313
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,610
