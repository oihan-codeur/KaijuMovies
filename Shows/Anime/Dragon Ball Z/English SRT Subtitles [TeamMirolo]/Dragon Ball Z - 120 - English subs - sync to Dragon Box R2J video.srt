<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5

Shall I say it plainly for everyone?

19
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,420
This is the end of the Earth.

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,700
All right!

21
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,870
Everyone spread out and kill off
the Earthlings here, one by one.

22
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,400
Yes!

23
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,810
<i>However, just then...</i>

24
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,880
Can we help you with something, Earthling?

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,760
I have come to kill you.

<i>"Freeza Halved by a Single Stroke!!</i>
<i>Another Super Saiyan."</i>

27
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,340
What did he just say?

28
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,320
I have come to kill you.

29
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,560
He said he's come to kill us, Papa.

30
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,860
It sure must be nice to live in ignorance.

31
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,360
Oh, I know you, all right.

32
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,860
You're Freeza, aren't you?

33
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,370
There's no reason to be so surprised.

34
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,370
I know everything about you.

35
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,870
What an honor.

36
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,370
To think that my name is already known...

37
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,880
...on a planet as far removed as this one.

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,380
Unfortunately for you,
you apparently haven't heard...

39
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:55,520
...that I'm the most powerful
being in the universe.

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,890
I also know that you are going to die here.

41
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,870
Such irresponsible talk.

42
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,870
Take care of him!

43
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,740
The rest of you go finish
off the other Earthlings.

44
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,880
Hey, you guys! You're better
off not taking such futile actions.

45
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,380
Or else you guys will die here too.

46
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,380
Kid, you're finished.

47
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,420
Hey! Hold on, he's all mine.

48
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,860
His battle power is only 5.

49
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,860
Piece of scum.

50
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,370
This will hurt a bit, but just be patient.

51
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,400
It'll be over quickly.

52
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,280
Why you rotten punk!

53
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,750
Freeza<i>-sama...</i>

54
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,410
You're not so bad after all.

55
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,040
What? What's the matter, everyone?

56
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,380
All of a sudden, an
incredibly large <i>ki</i> appeared...

57
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,650
...and in an instant, a
bunch of other <i>ki</i> vanished.

58
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,890
What in the world could be going on?

59
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,390
What do you guys mean?

60
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:22,090
What's happening over behind that mountain?!

61
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,700
<i>Impossible! This ki...</i>

62
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,730
<i>It's Saiyan!</i>

63
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,050
You do pretty well, don't you...

64
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,380
...for an Earthling, anyhow.

65
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,080
Next, it's your turn.

66
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,190
This is a surprise. Did you hear him, Freeza?

67
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,060
I think he's going to try to kill us next.

68
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,290
This brat doesn't know his place.

69
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,400
How about I teach you an important lesson?

70
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,870
Those who are only half as strong as they
ought to be are the ones who die soonest.

71
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,370
You mean like yourself?

72
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,870
What did you say?!

73
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,280
Having been reduced to that ridiculous form,

74
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,210
it must have taken a lot of
nerve coming all the way to Earth,

75
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,420
just so you could be killed.

76
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,890
You've got quite a mouth on you, kid.

77
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,220
Papa, he needs to be punished.

78
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,890
I would say what he has cost
you here already is worthy of death.

79
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,330
It's more than you deserve,

80
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,400
but I will serve as your executioner.
You should be honored.

81
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,910
You two will be killed by me
instantaneously. This I know.

82
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,780
This you know?

83
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,350
That's a rather unique expression.

84
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,850
Come at me with everything
you have, right from the start.

85
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,950
I won't go as easy on you as Son Goku did.

86
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:00,360
Son Goku?

87
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,860
That's the name of the Super Saiyan, Papa.

88
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,860
I see now, so you're one of his friends?

89
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,740
I've never met him. I only know of him.

90
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:16,870
You only know of him?

91
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,540
You just got finished saying–

92
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,610
that you were going to kill
off all the Earthlings here,

93
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,380
before the Super Saiyan
arrives, in order to mortify him.

94
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,350
That's exactly what I said.
You're going to be one of them.

95
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,020
Of course, since you've
killed all my men, it means that I,

96
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,730
Freeza will have to take
matters into my own hands now.

97
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,370
Such a miscalculation.

98
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,570
What do you mean?

99
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,870
I can purge the Earth of all its
vermin for you in the blink of an eye.

100
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,900
That's not what I meant!

101
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,280
Your miscalculation, the one I'm speaking of...

102
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,390
...is that Son Goku is not
the one and only Super Saiyan,

103
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,330
but that there is also another one, right here.

104
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:12,770
What?!

105
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,800
Well, this is a surprise!

106
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,420
I admire your ability to hold a bluff for so long!

107
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,740
It can't be!

108
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,650
What's this?

109
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,850
What kind of <i>ki</i> is this?!

110
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,450
What's going on?!

111
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,020
This is just like it was on Namek!

112
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,520
It's Father!

113
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,020
What?

114
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,620
It's the same <i>ki</i> that my Father had back then!

115
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,190
That means...

116
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,130
<i>A Super Saiyan? Impossible!</i>

117
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,140
<i>There's another Super Saiyan, besides Kakarrot?!</i>

118
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,170
<i>Now there's two of them,</i>
<i>and I'm not among them?!</i>

119
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,740
This is a Super Saiyan?

120
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,240
Those eyes!

121
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,050
Those are the eyes!

122
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,760
What are you so frightened of?

123
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,930
Burn in hell!

124
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,600
It's started!

125
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,740
Damn!

126
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,240
Don't fly!

127
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,040
I told you, they'll have Scouters with them!

128
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,980
If we're discovered, we're finished!

129
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,880
If we want to get closer, we'll have to walk!

130
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,510
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

131
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,660
Gohan, where is Goku and what is he doing?

132
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,730
Much as I hate to say it,
there's not a thing we can do!

133
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:11,260
Once Goku finally returns,
Earth may not even be here, dammit!

134
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,910
Vegeta, surely you can manage something?

135
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,910
Shut up!

136
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,180
Unless you want to get killed
with the rest of us, go home now!

137
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,280
You managed to return safely from Namek.

138
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,020
No matter how big an idiot you
may be, you should know the situation!

139
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,190
Idiot?

140
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,190
Vegeta, you can't accuse
Bulma of being an idiot.

141
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,530
That's right, Yamucha!

142
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,690
Yeah!

143
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,700
She's just the world's biggest rubbernecker,

144
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,200
not to mention biggest shrew.

145
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,700
Hold on! You're not being any help at all!

146
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,700
Huh? Oh, right!

147
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,910
I've had just about enough of you, Yamucha.

148
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,810
And the rest of you, what's so funny?

149
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,020
That's probably the last laugh we'll ever have.

150
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:11,890
Ah, hell.

151
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,700
Hold up!

152
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,200
I can't believe they would
just leave a lady behind like this!

153
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,970
Bulma<i>-san</i>, let's go home now.

154
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,340
We've come so far, how can we leave now?

155
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,540
Who do you think you're talking to?

156
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,380
I've been in scenes this
dangerous many times before...

157
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,880
...and I've managed to come
through them every single time...

158
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,920
I'm Bulma<i>-sama</i>!

159
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,890
So then, let's go!

160
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,890
Hey, Vegeta! Take me with you!

161
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,600
You're on foot anyhow!

162
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,210
Freeza, we won't be served
if you destroy the planet.

163
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,210
This Son Goku guy won't be able to return.

164
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,410
I know that, Papa. I didn't
put everything I had into...

165
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,230
You can't afford to think...

166
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,100
...so little of me as to ration
out your power like that.

167
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,240
Not since you're going to be killed by me.

168
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,240
Why you smart-mouthed kid!

169
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,210
Take this!

170
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,580
Freeza!

171
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,320
The planet is going to crumble!

172
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,580
What?!

173
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,280
What's this?!

174
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,520
Now what? Huh? What's happening?

175
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,220
Hey, what's going on?!

176
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,890
What kind of fight are they having?

177
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,070
Not too bad.

178
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,710
Freeza being alive was certainly unexpected,

179
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:46,210
but who could that young man be?

180
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,220
His power may be greater than even Goku's.

181
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,220
I have absolutely no data on him.

182
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,720
At this point...

183
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,600
We'll just have to wait to see what turns up!

184
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,570
Hey... why you...

185
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,380
Foolish Freeza.

186
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,550
It looks as though your arrogant
conceit is what will cost you your life.

187
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,220
A fight is something
to be finished all at once.

188
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,250
Well then, as you wish,
let's finish this, all at once.

189
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,110
Oh no!

190
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:50,280
Freeza intends to blow him away,
along with the whole planet!

191
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,310
That's ten times the energy he
used to destroy the planet Namek!

192
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:03,620
Freeza! Are you trying to
obliterate the whole planet?

193
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,400
We can always finish Son Goku off in space!

194
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,450
What the...?

195
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,290
Everyone! Get down!

196
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,630
The planet's going to explode! Freeza, let's go!

197
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,440
What's this?

198
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,180
What?!

199
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,850
Impossible!

200
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,630
Why aren't you dead?!

201
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,300
What's the matter? Is this all you've got?

202
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,140
You did it, Freeza!

203
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,780
Looks as though he was
no match for us after all.

204
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,680
I got in some good exercise
before Son Goku showed up.

205
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,600
Freeza!!

206
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:32,900
You challenge me with
such a low-level attack?!

207
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,220
<i>What's this?</i>

208
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,220
<i>There's another Super</i>
<i>Saiyan, in addition to Goku?</i>

209
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:27,260
<i>Who can this young man be,</i>
<i>who so easily cut Freeza clean in half?</i>

210
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,450
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

211
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:54,290
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

212
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,660
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

213
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:05,160
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

214
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,670
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

215
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:15,780
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

216
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,280
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

217
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,920
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

218
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,430
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

219
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,530
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

220
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,330
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

221
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,370
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

222
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:45,040
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

223
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,210
<i>So sorry.</i>

224
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:52,350
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

225
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,360
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

226
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,670
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

227
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,670
<i>Whoo! He took Freeza apart in no time flat!</i>

228
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,040
<i>His strength is awesome! Who on earth is he?</i>

229
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,610
<i>Cold the Great, now it's your turn.</i>

230
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,380
<i>I have to finish this up,</i>
<i>and go to meet Son Goku-san.</i>

231
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:29,520
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

232
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,050
<i>"Heya!! It's Been a While...</i>
<i>Son Goku Returns."</i>

233
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,500
<i>Father, welcome back!</i>

234
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,060
"Next time"
"Heya!! It's Been a While...
Son Goku Returns"
