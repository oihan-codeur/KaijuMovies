<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:30,325
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:36,045
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:41,675
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:48,975
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:54,685
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,315
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,355 --> 00:01:00,195
<i>The sky is clear</i>

00:01:00,235 --> 00:01:03,025
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,615
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,615
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,625
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:14,295
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,635
<i>My head is clear,</i>

00:01:25,675 --> 00:01:28,635
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:31,015
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:34,185
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:37,025
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:39,855
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:46,115
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:55,955
<i>During the fourth match</i>
<i>of the Tenkaichi Tournament,</i>

24
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:57,495
<i>between Kibit and Son Gohan,</i>

25
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:03,135
<i>Yamu and Spopovitch suddenly force</i>
<i>their way in and steal Gohan's energy,</i>

26
00:02:03,175 --> 00:02:06,675
<i>and then head off toward Madoshi Babidi.</i>

27
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:13,055
<i>Goku and the others join</i>
<i>Kaioshin in following after them.</i>

28
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:22,145
It's Babidi!

29
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,775
Dabura's together with him!

30
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:30,245
Your use to me...

31
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:32,905
...has now passed.

32
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:58,395
<i>Madoshi Babidi at last reveals himself,</i>

33
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:04,815
<i>as well as the King of the</i>
<i>World of Darkness, Dabura.</i>

34
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:19,585
<i>"The Awaiting Trap!!</i>
<i>A Challenge from the Demon Realm."</i>

35
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:26,885
That was so pathetic!

36
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:30,755
That last look on Yamu
and Spopovitch's faces!

37
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:36,435
Indeed, watching that is
one of my little pleasures.

38
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:40,895
We will be able to see many
more of those faces here on Earth.

39
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:42,895
You're right!

40
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:52,405
How awful!

41
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,495
How could they?

42
00:03:57,825 --> 00:03:59,785
That's how he...

43
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:02,625
...how Madoshi Babidi works.

44
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:06,795
Babidi takes the strongest warriors
from all over, brings them together...

45
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:09,425
and uses his magic to make them obey him.

46
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:14,345
Once they're no longer useful to him,
he disposes of them like trash.

47
00:04:15,465 --> 00:04:16,975
He intends on gathering the energy

48
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:23,225
to revive the sealed-up
Majin Boo the in same way.

49
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:28,655
Now then, Dabura...

50
00:04:28,695 --> 00:04:29,815
Yes?

51
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:31,985
Just as I expected,

52
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:36,695
it seems Yamu and friend brought
plenty of grubs along with them...

53
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:44,125
...along with Kaioshin, who
so long ago killed my father.

54
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,005
They seem to think that
they are hiding from us.

55
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:58,015
In all... seven of them...

56
00:04:58,055 --> 00:05:02,815
Even if we can't make use of
Kaioshin and Kibit's energy,

57
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:05,145
three of them appear to
have the wonderful energy

58
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:09,815
necessary for Majin Boo's revival.

59
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:12,865
I'd say so. Even with just those three,

60
00:05:12,905 --> 00:05:17,035
we can probably obtain
more than enough energy.

61
00:05:21,035 --> 00:05:26,125
To think that Majin Boo's
revival would come so quickly!

62
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,045
Lure the three of them
inside the spaceship, okay?

63
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:35,385
That's the surest way to
draw their energy from them.

64
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:40,015
Right. However, Kaioshin is
not likely to let that happen.

65
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:45,855
Polish off all but those three.
Then hurry back inside the ship.

66
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:50,355
I think those three will fly off the
handle and are sure to follow you inside.

67
00:05:50,395 --> 00:05:56,195
I see. That is my role, then?

68
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:59,865
That's it. Don't polish off Kaioshin, okay?

69
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:03,035
He killed my father, after all.

70
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:06,585
Afterward, I'll kill him
slowly and surely myself.

71
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:14,385
I understand, Babidi-<i>sama.</i>
I will leave that pleasure for you.

72
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,595
Well, it's up to you now.

73
00:06:16,635 --> 00:06:17,595
Right!

74
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:27,395
B-Babidi-<i>sama</i>! What about me?

75
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:33,235
Puipui, Dabura alone can
handle this. You come inside too.

76
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:36,235
I'll let you handle the first Stage.

77
00:06:38,445 --> 00:06:39,615
Right!

78
00:06:43,325 --> 00:06:48,335
Huh? They left Dabura alone and went inside!

79
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:57,635
Well, let's do this.

80
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:09,855
We've been found out!

81
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,795
Kibit!

82
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,505
Kibit-<i>san</i>!

83
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:45,425
Dammit!

84
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:06,905
Watch out!

85
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:10,335
Oh, no! Dabura's saliva is...

86
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,785
What?!

87
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:16,175
Why, you...!

88
00:08:16,215 --> 00:08:17,585
Hey!

89
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:21,215
Wha...?

90
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,605
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

91
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:01,175
Piccolo! Kuririn!

92
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:05,465
Piccolo!

93
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:09,225
What the hell's happening?

94
00:09:10,135 --> 00:09:12,725
S-Stone...

95
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:17,735
Anyone who comes in contact
with Dabura's saliva turns to stone!

96
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,695
What?!

97
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:21,945
Piccolo!

98
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:24,735
You mustn't! You must not touch him!

99
00:09:24,775 --> 00:09:26,285
Why not?!

100
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,615
If you touch them and somehow break them,

101
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:32,745
there will be no way to
return them to normal again.

102
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:36,495
It can't be! Damn you!

103
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:43,835
Damn you!

104
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:51,265
Go on home, now!
No one can defy Babidi-<i>sama</i>!

105
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:10,825
Ladies and gentlemen, please
quiet down! Please quiet down!

106
00:10:12,365 --> 00:10:14,205
Until the situation becomes more clear,

107
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:19,125
the Tenkaichi Tournament
will stand in recess for now.

108
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,295
What are you doing?! Go!

109
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:24,545
Hurry and get it going!

110
00:10:30,715 --> 00:10:35,305
Recess, huh? I wanted to
hurry up and have our match...

111
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:37,475
This is all your brother's fault!

112
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:39,685
He let himself be beaten
by those strange guys.

113
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,695
This isn't Big Brother's fault!

114
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:44,865
If it wasn't for that, the
matches would have continued.

115
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,695
Stop saying bad things about Big Brother!

116
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:51,035
Ow! Now you've done it, you...!

117
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:52,785
Ah, ouch!

118
00:10:58,535 --> 00:10:59,205
What, what?!

119
00:10:59,245 --> 00:10:59,875
What's the matter?

120
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:09,055
Are you all right, Mighty Mask-<i>san</i>?

121
00:11:09,095 --> 00:11:11,675
Owwww...

122
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:13,515
Are you hurt?

123
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:16,015
No! I-I'm fine!

124
00:11:17,725 --> 00:11:18,685
Snap out of it!

125
00:11:18,725 --> 00:11:21,065
What about you! Hold still!

126
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,065
Ow! Watch where you're going!

127
00:11:23,105 --> 00:11:25,945
I wonder if he's feeling okay...

128
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:38,205
Kuririn-<i>san</i>... Piccolo-<i>san...</i>

129
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:44,415
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, you just
said that if we broke them,

130
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,715
we couldn't return them
to normal, didn't you?

131
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:50,555
Well that must mean there's some way
to return them to normal, ain't there?

132
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:54,095
I-It's just...

133
00:11:54,135 --> 00:11:58,725
...not unless Dabura were to die...

134
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:04,145
What now, that's a
simple enough way, ain't it?

135
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:08,485
Father, let's go! We are
going after all, aren't we?

136
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,735
We have to save Kuririn-<i>san</i> and Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

137
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:15,785
Naturally! Let's go!

138
00:12:15,825 --> 00:12:17,575
Ah, wait just a moment!

139
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:21,075
We can't let ourselves
cater to the enemy's strategy!

140
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:26,755
Once we enter the enemy ship,
we play right into their hands!

141
00:12:26,795 --> 00:12:29,755
We have to wait and
watch a little while longer!

142
00:12:29,795 --> 00:12:33,135
I can't just leave Kuririn
and Piccolo like that!

143
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,505
Me either!

144
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,765
Sorry, man.

145
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:42,435
Just lingering around isn't
one of our stronger skills.

146
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:54,655
Of all the...!

147
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:33,695
All right, let's go!

148
00:13:33,735 --> 00:13:34,865
Right!

149
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:58,055
They're here! They're here!

150
00:13:58,095 --> 00:14:01,635
They really are simple fools, aren't they?!

151
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:05,645
They have entered our trap.

152
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:23,575
What's this? Where are we?
Sure is a tidy room.

153
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:27,785
There's a door over there.
Why don't we try breaking through it?

154
00:14:28,745 --> 00:14:30,375
Yeah.

155
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:42,555
What's this? Kaioshin-<i>sama,</i>
you've come after all?

156
00:14:42,595 --> 00:14:46,055
It's because you fellows are so reckless!

157
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:55,615
Once one enters this
ship, there is no leaving it!

158
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:59,115
At least not until we
defeat Babidi, I'm afraid.

159
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:06,495
Well, let's just defeat Babidi then.

160
00:15:06,535 --> 00:15:11,455
Hmph! If we had to, we could
always destroy the whole ship.

161
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:16,965
You must not! Any strong
shock could awaken Majin Boo!

162
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:22,515
You are all taking Babidi
and Majin Boo too lightly!

163
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:26,475
Even though Majin Boo's
energy may be incomplete,

164
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:28,105
he should still have enough
destructive power to kill all of us

165
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:34,565
and destroy the Earth in a short time!

166
00:15:39,525 --> 00:15:43,745
Now Kaioshin is here too? This is great!

167
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:48,705
You know, this really is a bleak room.

168
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:57,465
Babidi-<i>sama</i>... Babidi-<i>sama</i>...!

169
00:15:57,505 --> 00:16:00,005
Oh, Puipui?

170
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:04,635
Yes. Isn't it just about time?

171
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:06,645
Sorry to keep you waiting.

172
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:10,645
Well, take the energy from those
three and then come back down.

173
00:16:10,685 --> 00:16:13,815
Right! Leave that to me!

174
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:26,905
Oh, I nearly forgot! We have
to inject this energy right away.

175
00:16:32,585 --> 00:16:36,675
Come along, Dabura. We know how
this will turn out without watching.

176
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:38,835
R-Right!

177
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:15,915
Welcome! This is the first Stage.

178
00:17:15,955 --> 00:17:17,875
First Stage?

179
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:20,045
What's that?

180
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:23,425
Babidi-<i>sama</i> is on the very bottom floor.

181
00:17:23,465 --> 00:17:27,055
However, unless you pass
through the various Stages,

182
00:17:27,095 --> 00:17:31,225
and defeat each of the warriors that
come out, you cannot proceed downward.

183
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:40,445
Your opponent for the first
Stage is me. Which means...

184
00:17:40,485 --> 00:17:44,365
You guys are finished here!

185
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:55,375
Nah. I don't think that's going to happen!

186
00:18:10,475 --> 00:18:12,805
Wh-What's this?!

187
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:15,815
This much energy in one session?!

188
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:18,985
We've collected nearly half of it all at once!

189
00:18:19,025 --> 00:18:21,355
What's this?!

190
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:28,445
How many hundreds of people did
Yamu and Spopovitch gather this from?

191
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:33,455
Well, I did not ask them.

192
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:38,495
If they gathered this great
an energy in such a short time,

193
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:41,545
I guess I shouldn't have killed them.

194
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,845
Oh, it will be all right.

195
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:49,805
I think that with the energy being
collected from those three in Stage 1,

196
00:18:49,845 --> 00:18:52,975
there will be nearly
enough to fill it up to the top.

197
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:57,975
If all goes well, Majin Boo's
revival can be realized within the day.

198
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:02,815
That is what we lured
those guys in here for, after all!

199
00:19:02,855 --> 00:19:08,825
Let's see. You never know, Puipui may
have already taken care of all three of them.

200
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:11,825
Let's go, Dabura.

201
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:12,945
Let's see...

202
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:20,875
Huh? What, aren't they fighting yet?

203
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:23,835
Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

204
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:33,385
Tie, go again! Tie, go again! Tie, go again!

205
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:39,145
Wh-What are those guys up to?!

206
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:47,655
I did it!

207
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:50,735
Nice going, Vegeta!

208
00:19:50,775 --> 00:19:53,745
All right then, I go first.

209
00:19:53,785 --> 00:19:54,905
Uh, er...

210
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:58,785
You're thinking of fighting him alone?

211
00:19:58,825 --> 00:20:02,835
Of course I am! Me by myself
is plenty against a guy like this!

212
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:16,935
Babidi-<i>sama</i> said to be careful
since you all have such strong energy,

213
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:19,935
but apparently, you're all just fools!

214
00:20:19,975 --> 00:20:23,395
Are you sure it isn't this
Babidi guy that's the fool?

215
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:24,775
He didn't check things out very well,

216
00:20:24,815 --> 00:20:26,775
and now he's going to
regret not realizin'...

217
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:29,985
...that the very strongest guys in the
universe were right here on Earth,

218
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:31,275
of all places.

219
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:34,195
Very strongest...?

220
00:20:38,455 --> 00:20:41,835
You guys are the most full-fledged of fools!

221
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,835
We must not make light of the enemy!

222
00:20:45,505 --> 00:20:49,085
Babidi only takes the strongest
warriors from the corners of the universe

223
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,295
and allies them to himself!

224
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:56,305
Hey, hey, it'll be okay, let's just
see about leaving this to Vegeta.

225
00:20:56,345 --> 00:20:57,975
But...

226
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:01,935
There's no way you guys
are getting away from here!

227
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:06,945
And the damage you guys take will
be absorbed by this room as energy,

228
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:10,945
and directed into the ball
Majin Boo-<i>sama</i> is sealed in.

229
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,445
I'm relieved to hear that.

230
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:14,985
It means that as long
as we take no damage,

231
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,825
no energy will be taken, right?

232
00:21:17,865 --> 00:21:19,995
That's right!

233
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:23,995
But unfortunately for you, that's impossible!

234
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,205
Not as long as I'm here!

235
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:31,085
What an unpleasant punk you are.

236
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:40,015
Enough talk. Let's get this overwith!

237
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:46,855
Bring it on!

238
00:21:46,895 --> 00:21:50,985
This kid named Vegeta...

239
00:22:06,955 --> 00:22:08,205
Vegeta-<i>san...</i>

240
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:25,265
<i>The fight in the first Stage has finally begun.</i>

241
00:22:25,305 --> 00:22:29,605
<i>Vegeta is quite sure of himself, however...</i>

242
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:38,985
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

243
00:22:40,745 --> 00:22:45,575
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

244
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:56,135
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

245
00:22:56,175 --> 00:23:02,265
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

246
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:09,275
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

247
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:14,645
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

248
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:18,485
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

249
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:27,585
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

250
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,125
<i>Even now?</i>

251
00:23:29,165 --> 00:23:36,755
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

252
00:23:36,795 --> 00:23:42,135
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

253
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:48,645
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

254
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:58,655
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

255
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:15,675
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

256
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:17,885
<i>The first stage is underway! Huh?</i>

257
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:22,095
<i>Hu-uh? The room seems</i>
<i>different somehow. What's going on?</i>

258
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:25,345
<i>It was Babidi. Babidi</i>
<i>changed it with his magic,</i>

259
00:24:25,385 --> 00:24:27,935
<i>to a place that benefits his fighter.</i>

260
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:30,055
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

261
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,735
<i>"Don't Toy With Me!!</i>
<i>Vegeta's Breakthrough First Strike of Fury."</i>

262
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:37,445
<i>Vegeta-san's opponent is</i>
<i>so weak, it's making him angry.</i>

263
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:39,565
"Next time"
"Don't Toy With Me!!
Vegeta's Breakthrough First Strike of Fury"
