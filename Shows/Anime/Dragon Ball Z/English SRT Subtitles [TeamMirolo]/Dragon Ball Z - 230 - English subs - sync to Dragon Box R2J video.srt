the spectators have fled,
and there's no television...

36
00:04:02,395 --> 00:04:05,355
Under the circumstances, there
isn't much sense in having one.

37
00:04:05,395 --> 00:04:08,645
Well, we'll just leave it at "See you later."

00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:15,695
Runner-up?

40
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:16,705
That would have to be Contestant No. 18,

one-on-one with you, wouldn't it?

this, where has he gone off to?!

going to bring this to an end quickly!

Majin Boo's energy is quickly,
quickly being stored up!

All that's left is how we're going
to serve them up, right Dabura?

58
00:08:17,275 --> 00:08:18,775
That is right.

61
00:08:44,635 --> 00:08:47,595
Some of Babidi's warriors?

62
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:51,265
We don't have time to toy
with these small fry. Let's hurry!

63
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:52,435
Right!

64
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:55,185
H-Hey, let's go!

65
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,385
As good as ever!

66
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,485
They sure are confident.

67
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,945
Does this mean they don't feel it
necessary to buy any more time?

68
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:46,325
Let's go, onto where Majin Boo's ball is!

69
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:47,735
Right!

70
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:57,455
Very soon, you will see the death
of Kaioshin before your very eyes!

71
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:59,755
I'm counting on it, Dabura!

72
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:32,635
You defy me? You defy me, Kakarrot?!

73
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:45,165
What are you doing, Goten?!

74
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:48,335
If we're not quick, we won't
be able to see Majin Boo!

75
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:49,675
But...

76
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:50,835
What is it?

77
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,715
I have to go pee!

78
00:12:54,755 --> 00:12:57,885
Go pee? Just hold it in!

79
00:12:57,925 --> 00:13:00,845
I can't! After all, I haven't gone the whole time

80
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:04,685
since the tournament started!
I'm going to leak out!

81
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,525
I can't do anything with you!

82
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:10,315
Okay, over there!

83
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:12,315
Go do it over there!

84
00:13:12,355 --> 00:13:13,325
Hurry!

85
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:15,365
Yeah!

86
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,715
–Trunks-<i>kun</i>!
–Me too!

87
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:39,725
Mine's shooting out so far!

88
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:40,765
Look at mine!

89
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:47,765
Whee! There it goes! There it goes!

90
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:04,245
–Ah, that startled me!
–We have to hurry!

91
00:14:04,285 --> 00:14:05,875
Let's fly, Goten!

92
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:08,665
Yeah!

93
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:32,735
W-What force! Vegeta's raised
his power quite a bit, huh?

94
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:37,695
Vegeta...

95
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:13,645
What's the matter, weren't
you going to end this quickly?

96
00:15:13,685 --> 00:15:16,615
That's what I'm trying to do.

97
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:18,655
And this is the way?

98
00:15:19,865 --> 00:15:25,075
However, this does not approach
the humiliation I've been subjected to!

99
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:38,715
Not yet! Even at this, it still falls far, far short!

100
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:12,145
For myself, the proud Saiyan prince,

101
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:17,145
to be pitied by a lower-class
warrior, such as yourself...

102
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:20,985
To have my life saved by you...!

103
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:28,615
You are to be put to death!
I'll tear you clean apart!

104
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:31,865
Starting with your arms!

105
00:17:46,045 --> 00:17:47,965
What?!

106
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:37,555
<i>Where is he?</i>

107
00:18:51,035 --> 00:18:53,455
Here, Kakarrot!

108
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,215
<i>Kamehame...</i>

109
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:13,425
Take this!

110
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:37,015
Is that Majin Boo's ball?

111
00:20:37,055 --> 00:20:39,015
Yes. The fearsome Majin Boo,

112
00:20:39,055 --> 00:20:43,975
born of the evil Madoshi Bibidi, is inside there.

113
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:51,615
<i>Incredible. This is an enormous, evil ki,</i>

114
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:52,985
<i>the likes of which I've never felt until now.</i>

115
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:54,905
That is correct.

116
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:04,835
I welcome you here.

117
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:10,125
How nice of you to come, Kaioshin.

118
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:13,335
I have come to defeat you, Babidi.

119
00:21:14,545 --> 00:21:17,175
Rotten enemy of my papa!

120
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:20,555
I will also terminate the
revival of the Majin Boo.

121
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:25,015
Unfortunately, I do not think
it will go that smoothly for you.

122
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:29,895
The demonic king, Dabura, is here as well!

123
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:37,535
Let's hurry, Gohan-<i>san</i>. Even as
we're here, the damage energy

124
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:42,165
from Goku-<i>san</i> may be on its way to Majin Boo!

125
00:21:42,205 --> 00:21:46,875
–Right.
–I will fight Babidi.

126
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:14,565
<i>An unprecedented, fierce conflict between</i>
<i>Goku and Vegeta! Who will be the winner?</i>

127
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:18,535
<i>Further, will Shin and Gohan be</i>
<i>able to defeat Babidi and Dabura,</i>

128
00:22:18,575 --> 00:22:24,205
<i>and stop Majin Boo from being revived?</i>

129
00:22:34,335 --> 00:22:38,925
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

130
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:45,515
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

131
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:56,065
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

132
00:22:56,105 --> 00:23:02,195
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

133
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:09,205
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

134
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:14,585
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

135
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:18,425
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

136
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:27,515
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

137
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:29,065
<i>Even now?</i>

138
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:36,695
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

139
00:23:36,735 --> 00:23:42,075
<i>There's some mysterious</i>

140
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:48,575
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

141
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:58,585

<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

142
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,985
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

143
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:20,025
<i>Our fighting has allowed</i>
<i>Majin Boo's energy to be filled up.</i>

144
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:23,325
<i>This is the worst! I've</i>
<i>completely misjudged things!</i>

145
00:24:23,365 --> 00:24:27,665
<i>How has Goku-san's damage</i>
<i>energy filled it up so quickly?!</i>

146
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:29,875

149
00:24:36,955 --> 00:24:39,715
"Next time"

Out Comes the Vicious Majin Boo!!"
