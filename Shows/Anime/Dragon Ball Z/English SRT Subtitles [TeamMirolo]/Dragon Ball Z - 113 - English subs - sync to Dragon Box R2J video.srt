<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245

00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,915 --> 00:01:58,375
<i>The terrifying, devilish hand of Garlic Jr.</i>

00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,455
<i>But then, Piccolo...</i>

20
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:46,625
Wait. Didn't I say I would
strike the finishing blow?

21
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,595
So you did.

22
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:56,095
Kuririn!

23
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:09,815
<i>"Can't Wait Until Morning!! Kami-sama</i>
<i>Determines a Suicidal Course of Action."</i>

24
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:25,535
You–how?!

25
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:28,065
You really expected me to do as you wanted?

26
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:50,555
Yeah, but you could have
pulled your punches a little.

27
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,525
I mean, poor Gohan!

28
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:58,365
He's trained hard enough that our level
of attack wouldn't have worn him out.

29
00:04:09,615 --> 00:04:11,085
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

30
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:22,085
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

31
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:40,075
There's no way I'm going
to be beaten by just that.

32
00:04:41,585 --> 00:04:42,875
In which case,

33
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:46,085
I wish you had told us
earlier what you were up to.

34
00:04:57,595 --> 00:04:59,595
Listen closely, Kuririn.

35
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:02,465
I'm going to rough up Gohan some more.

36
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:08,605
Garlic wants to finish Gohan off for himself.

37
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:12,235
As such, he's certain to
muscle his way in between us.

38
00:05:12,275 --> 00:05:16,575
Then, when he lets his guard down,
we'll get the bottle that Kami is in.

39
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:21,245
And so, we were able to get through
this without creating any painful memories.

40
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:33,565
You know, Kuririn<i>-san</i> and Piccolo<i>-san,</i>
your acting was pretty good.

41
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,835
I was completely fooled.

42
00:05:37,935 --> 00:05:39,905
With Kami being held prisoner,

43
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:44,235
this was the only way we could
have gotten close enough to that punk.

44
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,905
I'm sorry, Piccolo,

45
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,245
to have made you go
through all that trouble for me.

46
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:54,115
Don't misunderstand!
I didn't do all of this for you!

47
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,755
It's because with you in captivity,

48
00:05:58,795 --> 00:06:02,255
I couldn't generate the power I would need.

49
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,065
P-Piccolo...

50
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,195
What are you dawdling around for?

51
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:14,205
Leave them to us, and
go get the Ultra Holy Water!

52
00:06:14,245 --> 00:06:15,535
You got it.

53
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:30,215
Garlic Jr.! Your lust for power ends here!

54
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:33,655
I'm going to send you back into
that world of darkness once again!

55
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,255
Well, bring it on!

56
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:07,255
Even if you have managed
to obtain the Ultra Holy Water,

57
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:09,255
there's no way that you'll
be able to use it in time.

58
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:10,895
What?

59
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,895
Even if you unseal the Ultra Holy Water here,

60
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:17,935
how many hours do you suppose it
would take for it to cover the whole world?

61
00:07:17,975 --> 00:07:20,235
Before it does, the sun will have risen,

62
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:23,235
and you will no longer be
able to counteract the Aquamist!

63
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:26,205
No matter what you do, you're out of time!

64
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,415
Your plan appears to have failed as well.

65
00:07:31,915 --> 00:07:35,045
All that remains is for
me to create an ideal world,

66
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:38,385
filled with disaster and suffering.

67
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:41,415
The world, as I wish it to be!

68
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:50,565
D-Dammit!

69
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:53,765
Is... there nothing we... can do?

70
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,105
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

71
00:08:15,925 --> 00:08:18,225
We've come this far. We'll be all right.

72
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:20,395
What's wrong with those people?

73
00:08:20,435 --> 00:08:22,895
Why did they suddenly become so violent?

74
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:26,135
It's because of that black fog. I saw it.

75
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,605
In any case, I still have my eternal life!

76
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,045
No matter how you may struggle,

77
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:09,605
this world, filled to
overflowing with the Demon Clan,

78
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:13,085
will continue as I wish through eternity!

79
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:16,415
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

80
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,665
It's okay, Kami<i>-sama.</i>

81
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:35,535
There is way to spread
Ultra Holy Water in short time.

82
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,065
What?

83
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:45,715
If use seven currents that cover whole world,

84
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:48,885
spreading Ultra Holy Water easy.

85
00:09:48,925 --> 00:09:51,215
Really, Mister Popo?!

86
00:09:51,255 --> 00:09:55,885
Really. There is hole at the bottom of
Heavenly Realm where currents gather.

87
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:58,925
Just pour Ultra Holy Water there.

88
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,565
Then we'll go there now!

89
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:04,565
But Kami<i>-sama</i>, there is great danger.

90
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,865
At bottom of Heavenly Realm is Shinsenkai.

91
00:10:07,905 --> 00:10:10,235
Shinsenkai?

92
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:15,705
Yes, Shinsenkai. Place where
graves of former Kami are.

93
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,445
Very, very holy place.

94
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:22,345
If Kami<i>-sama</i> goes there,
give up being Kami<i>-sama.</i>

95
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:26,455
Perhaps even have spirit pulled out and die.

96
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:29,225
Is that so?

97
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:31,255
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

98
00:10:37,175 --> 00:10:40,065
I do not care. Come, Mister Popo.

99
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:44,075
All of this is my responsibility.

100
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:46,235
U-Understood.

101
00:10:50,185 --> 00:10:52,815
Popo guide you.

102
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,345
I'm counting on it.

103
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,055
I won't allow it!

104
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:05,995
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

105
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,855
You'll have to deal with me!

106
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:46,395
Piccolo!

107
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:50,205
Kami! Hurry and go! Go!!

108
00:11:50,245 --> 00:11:53,215
Right! I'll leave this to you!

109
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:38,785
How long do you guys intend
to swear allegiance to Freeza?

110
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:23,665
Impossible! To be defeated by a single Saiyan!

111
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:34,115
It's laughable that you
would seek my life at your level.

112
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:46,285
This is what you get for
underestimating a Saiyan.

113
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,265
It's true for you as it was true for Freeza.

114
00:13:53,605 --> 00:13:57,335
Kakarrot! Where are you?!

115
00:14:24,295 --> 00:14:26,125
See you in hell!

116
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,815
<i>Kienzan</i>!

117
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:56,325
Don't toy with me!

118
00:16:15,505 --> 00:16:17,275
Now to finish you!

119
00:16:17,315 --> 00:16:19,805
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

120
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:29,615
Take this!

121
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:37,085
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

122
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:07,125
What's the matter? Are you finished already?

123
00:17:11,335 --> 00:17:15,295
Piccolo! You and Kami are
of one heart and one body!

124
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:19,465
If Kami dies, you die as well, yes?

125
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:23,875
So whether he has his spirit taken
from him and dies in the Shinsenkai first,

126
00:17:23,915 --> 00:17:27,545
or you lose your life to me first,

127
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:32,015
either way there's no possibility
of you surviving, is there?

128
00:17:35,085 --> 00:17:39,055
Unfortunately for you,
I'm not as weak as you are.

129
00:17:39,095 --> 00:17:41,555
I am not going to die!

130
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:42,455
What?!

131
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:46,995
Like I said before, you're
going to regret having eternal life!

132
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:05,045
Mister Popo, aren't we to the Shinsenkai yet?

133
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,415
L-Little farther.

134
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:29,765
Hmm?

135
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:34,905
Haven't you realized it yet?

136
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:36,935
That red star!

137
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,855
That is the homeworld of the Demon Clan,

138
00:18:45,895 --> 00:18:50,455
which has revived me and
given me such great power!

139
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,435
The Makyo World!

140
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:56,765
It has returned near to Earth after 5,000 years!

141
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,035
And when it draws near,

142
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:07,175
the power of we, the Demon Clan,
increases many times over!

143
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:13,775
So then, why don't I show
you my true power now?!

144
00:19:27,605 --> 00:19:32,595
W-What's that?! Garlic Jr.'s
<i>ki</i> has suddenly risen sharply!

145
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:58,825
This is bad! Gohan,
Kuririn, get out of here, now!

146
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,495
W-What?!

147
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,665
It's up to you, Popo!

148
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,845
Kami<i>-sama</i>! It's open!

149
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,375
He didn't have to do all that!

150
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:17,605
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

151
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,575
Gohan, stay sharp!

152
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:28,245
You certainly did us in
pretty well earlier, little ones.

153
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:31,685
But we've crawled back out
of hell to have our revenge!

154
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:34,715
Now with many times
the power we had before.

155
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:05,795
You're...

156
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:15,395
<i>Pitted against the terrifying power-up</i>
<i>afforded Garlic Jr. by the Makyo World,</i>

157
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:19,395
<i>Piccolo and the others</i>
<i>face their greatest danger!</i>
