<i>Gohan was coming to Satan City</i>

G-Good day.

00:02:43,555 --> 00:02:47,555
I'm Son. Son Gohan. Nice to meet you.

31
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:51,185
I'm Eraza. Nice to meet you.

32
00:02:51,225 --> 00:02:54,395
This girl here is Videl. Videl's Papa, you see,

33
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:57,855
is Mister Satan, of all people!

34
00:02:57,895 --> 00:02:59,735
Mister Satan?

35
00:03:11,075 --> 00:03:13,245
This is suspicious, all right!

36
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:25,215
<i>"For Love and Justice –</i>
<i>Enter the Great Saiyaman."</i>

37
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:42,065
You want to undergo a complete transformation,

38
00:03:42,105 --> 00:03:44,615
so that your identity is not revealed?

39
00:03:44,655 --> 00:03:49,115
Yes. I thought that you would
surely have some good ideas, Bulma-<i>san,</i>

40
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:51,825
so I stopped by on the way home from school.

41
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:54,085
Are there any good ways of doing this?

42
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,545
Sure there are. I am a genius, after all.

43
00:03:57,585 --> 00:04:01,925
Basically, I'd just need to convert
a transformation suit into particles,

44
00:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,755
like we do for capsules, so
that you can put it on at any time.

45
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:09,225
Really? By all means,
if I could ask you to do that...

46
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,265
It's just like you to not be able to keep quiet

47
00:04:11,305 --> 00:04:13,605
and turn a blind eye to evil, Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

48
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:17,605
Sure, I'll make one for you.
Wait here for a couple of hours.

49
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:23,615
You can do it in two hours?
How kind of you. Thank you very much.

50
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,615
Okay, just wait around for a bit.

51
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:31,785
Um, where's Trunks-<i>kun</i>? It would
be boring to just sit here waiting.

52
00:04:31,825 --> 00:04:37,625
Trunks is probably in the gravity room,
being put through the wringer by Vegeta.

53
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:38,795
By Vegeta-<i>san</i>?

54
00:04:38,835 --> 00:04:42,965
He says he's just about the right
age to be starting full-fledged training,

55
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,635
so he's teaching him some fighting moves.

56
00:04:45,675 --> 00:04:47,255
It appears that he wants to make Trunks-<i>kun</i>

57
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:50,135
even stronger than you, Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

58
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:52,225
That's frightening, isn't it?

59
00:05:02,695 --> 00:05:04,025
Yo, Trunks!

60
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:08,195
Ah, Gohan-<i>san</i>! When did you get here?

61
00:05:08,235 --> 00:05:10,655
I just barely arrived.

62
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:14,205
Say, I hear you're getting
training from your father.

63
00:05:14,245 --> 00:05:15,865
Uh-huh!

64
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:26,635
Good afternoon, Vegeta-<i>san.</i>
Forgive the intrusion.

65
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:27,755
Yeah.

66
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:33,845
Gohan, you've gotten soft.

67
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:37,055
Never mind how peaceful
it has become, keep training!

68
00:05:37,845 --> 00:05:39,105
Right.

69
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,945
Say, what should we do to play?

70
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:49,235
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, it's done!

71
00:05:55,575 --> 00:05:59,165
I just need to press this red switch, right?

72
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:00,205
Right, right.

73
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:03,915
How nice! Mother, make one for me, too!

74
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,465
This looks pretty cool, doesn't it?

75
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:16,225
Doesn't it, though?

76
00:06:16,265 --> 00:06:19,685
Good! This is extremely good!

77
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:23,605
I won't be needing one after all.

78
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,775
Okay, thank you very much!

79
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:32,615
Come again! Bye-bye!

80
00:06:32,655 --> 00:06:34,945
Bye-bye!

81
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:42,955
Home, if you please, Kinto Un.
We're late, so go at full speed.

82
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,805
Now I can get by without
people suspecting it's me.

83
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:04,935
You know what? If I can fly to
school in my transformed outfit,

84
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:07,815
I can go anywhere faster,
without people knowing who it is.

85
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:12,155
If you think I'm kidding,
Kinto Un, let's have a race!

86
00:07:16,825 --> 00:07:17,945
Here goes!

87
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:21,825
All right, start!

88
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:46,775
Come on, come on, Kinto Un! I'm speeding up!

89
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,745
Look how far ahead I am already!

90
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:08,835
<i>No one will realize it's me.</i>

91
00:08:14,845 --> 00:08:16,385
Reckless driver spotted!

92
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:23,185
Come on, come on, come on,
come on! Move it, move it, move it!

93
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:25,185
Floor it! Floor it!

94
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:32,655
<i>I'm already transformed, but anyway...</i>

95
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:34,565
Transform!!

96
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,925
Y-You dirty scumbag! You wanna die?!

97
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:54,925
W-Why, you! Where did you come from?!

98
00:08:54,965 --> 00:09:00,225
This reckless driving will not do!
You almost ran someone over.

99
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:03,765
Promise me that from now on,
you will drive safely through the city!

100
00:09:03,805 --> 00:09:07,065
Do what? With that ridiculous outfit on,

101
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:09,775
what are you talking about,
you perverted bastard?!

102
00:09:09,815 --> 00:09:12,315
Who do you think you are?

103
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:19,235
W-Who am I...? Yeah... Let's see...

104
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:20,615
What's with this guy?

105
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:22,495
He's a weirdo.

106
00:09:23,825 --> 00:09:25,625
I know...!

107
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:31,915
I am... he who loves justice...
the Great Saiyaman!

108
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,925
Great... Saiyaman...?

109
00:09:44,805 --> 00:09:49,765
You're who?! Not only is your
outfit corny, your name is corny, too!

110
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:56,815
Th-This guy really is a weirdo!
Let him have it! Let him have it!

111
00:09:58,985 --> 00:10:01,025
Stop making fun of me!

112
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:15,045
I thought as hard as
I could thinking up that name!

113
00:10:20,545 --> 00:10:24,515
I-I'm sorry. Now that I think
about it, that is a very nice name.

114
00:10:24,555 --> 00:10:26,805
From now on, we will drive safely.

115
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,905
Goodbye, Great Saiyaman, was it?

116
00:10:45,195 --> 00:10:47,165
Drive safely, drive safely.

117
00:10:47,205 --> 00:10:48,865
Right, right.

118
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:53,085
<i>You understand now, young people of the city?</i>

119
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:02,555
What is that outfit, Gohan?!

120
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,975
Mother, don't you like it?

121
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:07,805
For cryin' out loud, how
old do you think you are?!

122
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:10,845
You're just like your father in that regard.

123
00:11:13,565 --> 00:11:19,985
I'm home, Mother. Wow!
Big Brother, that looks cool!

124
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:21,945
You think so, Goten?

125
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,255
Okay, I'm leaving!

126
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,805
Big Brother, come home soon.

127
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:52,805
Gohan, don't rush. Watch out for airplanes.

128
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,105
Right.

129
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,735
That's neat, all right. Big Brother, you look cool!

130
00:12:05,905 --> 00:12:10,245
Don't I? Before long, your
Big Brother will ask Bulma-<i>san</i>

131
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:11,875
to make one for you, too, Goten.

132
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:13,375
I'm off!

133
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:19,335
Goten, you can take care of Kinto Un!

134
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:21,545
Your brother sure seems happy.

135
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:24,255
He's transformed over and
over again since yesterday.

136
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:27,885
Big Brother, you look cool!

137
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:33,725
<i>Gohan's younger brother, who</i>
<i>looks just like Goku, is named Goten.</i>

138
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:39,435
<i>He is Goku's second child, who was</i>
<i>left behind before the battle with Cell.</i>

139
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:51,115
<i>This is great! I should be able to get</i>
<i>there in about twenty minutes like this.</i>

140
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,285
This is great.

141
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:38,745
Now I'll be able to sleep in a little longer.

142
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:46,335
...and, as a result, this new element
of energy is extremely complex...

143
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:51,805
Hey, did you know there was a new

144
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:55,645
champion of justice who appeared yesterday?

145
00:13:55,685 --> 00:13:57,805
It wasn't the Golden Warrior, either.

146
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,685
Mm-hmm, I heard, I heard.

147
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,685
<i>They're talking about me.</i>

148
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:06,775
His outfit is awfully lame, but
he's supposed to be pretty strong.

149
00:14:06,815 --> 00:14:09,195
I hear his name is "Great Tireman."

150
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:13,825
No, it's not! It's "Great Saiyaman"!

151
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:21,375
W-Why would you know something like that?

152
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:27,505
Well, I... heard it from
someone who saw him personally.

153
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:32,095
Would it be okay if I continued
with the lesson, Son Gohan-<i>kun</i>?

154
00:14:33,345 --> 00:14:34,925
Yes!

155
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:41,725
Yes, this is Videl.

156
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:46,025
There has been a busjacking
at the eastern bus terminal!

157
00:14:54,365 --> 00:14:56,035
A group of three robbers has taken over

158
00:14:56,075 --> 00:15:00,335
a senior citizen group's sightseeing bus,
and are making ransom demands.

159
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,535
Request immediate–

160
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,545
Hurry up and bring us the ransom!

161
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,875
Otherwise, the old men
and women here are dead!

162
00:15:07,915 --> 00:15:10,255
Request assistance!

163
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:12,095
Copy! I'll be there at once!

164
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,725
Sensei, I'll be back in a bit!

165
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:18,475
G-Good work.

166
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:22,725
What's going on with Videl-<i>san</i>?

167
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:25,725
Videl's pastime is being a champion of justice.

168
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:28,905
Champion of justice?

169
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:33,285
See? She sure does act like the daughter of
Mister Satan, the man who saved the world.

170
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:37,075
She's strong, so the police
often call on her and stuff.

171
00:15:38,955 --> 00:15:40,615
She is...?

172
00:15:42,785 --> 00:15:48,415
Don't sell Videl short.
Her strength is far higher than my own.

173
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:52,885
In fact, she has enough
power to rival even Mister Satan.

174
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:56,465
<i>Strength to rival Mister Satan...?</i>

175
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:14,905
<i>She could be in trouble, if</i>
<i>she's the same as Mister Satan...</i>

176
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:21,825
–Hey, you!
–Bathroom!

177
00:16:29,795 --> 00:16:31,375
Transform!!

178
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:53,735
W-Where is this bus terminal?

179
00:16:58,695 --> 00:17:01,495
Boss, we're done loading it on.

180
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:06,455
As you demanded, we
have handed over the ransom!

181
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:09,545
Now, release the hostages!

182
00:17:10,915 --> 00:17:12,375
You fools!

183
00:17:16,715 --> 00:17:18,005
Get us moving!

184
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:31,685
Don't shoot! You'll hit the hostages!

185
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:32,935
Yahoo!

186
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:43,865
We've finally gotten underway.
I wonder where they're going to take us.

187
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:48,705
Who knows? At any rate, the busjackers
do have a great deal of money, so...

188
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:51,335
Yeah, it could be a long trip, huh?

189
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,675
Gangster-<i>san</i>, let me
take a souvenir photograph.

190
00:17:53,715 --> 00:17:55,215
Look over here.

191
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:58,215
Be quiet! You're a hostage!

192
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:00,595
Ready, "Cheese!"

193
00:18:02,305 --> 00:18:05,055
Y-You dumb bastard, keep your eyes forward!

194
00:18:20,325 --> 00:18:21,735
Dammit!

195
00:18:31,335 --> 00:18:33,295
That's Videl-<i>san</i>'s heli!

196
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:36,505
–Videl-<i>san</i>!
–Go get them!

197
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:51,265
Boss! Above us! Above us!

198
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:52,015
What?!

199
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,655
It's that champion of justice, Videl-<i>san</i>!

200
00:19:00,695 --> 00:19:02,655
Grandma, take a picture! Take a picture!

201
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,465
There they are.

202
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:30,725
She's pretty good.

203
00:19:41,735 --> 00:19:43,025
Damn!

204
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,215
Go get them, Videl-<i>san</i>!

205
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:59,585
Let them have it!

206
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,815
Videl-<i>san</i>'s knockout blows landed!

207
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:24,115
One shot, for a souvenir?

208
00:20:28,235 --> 00:20:29,745
The bus...!

209
00:20:59,815 --> 00:21:01,435
It couldn't be...

210
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,765
That was so much fun.

211
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:33,765
It was a hell of a tour, huh?

212
00:21:33,805 --> 00:21:36,605
Knock on wood, knock on wood.

213
00:21:36,645 --> 00:21:37,975
Who are you?

214
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:45,485
I am... he who does not abide evil...
the champion of justice...

215
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:51,615
Great Saiyaman!

216
00:21:51,655 --> 00:21:54,495
<i>I nailed it! I nailed it good!</i>

217
00:21:56,285 --> 00:21:57,625
<i>That was so uncool.</i>

218
00:21:57,665 --> 00:22:01,705
<i>This is the champion of justice, Great Saiyaman?</i>

219
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,675
Well then, farewell, Videl-<i>san.</i>

220
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:10,845
<i>Why does he know my name?!</i>

221
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:20,185
<i>A new hero is born!</i>

222
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:24,695
<i>His name, the champion</i>
<i>of justice, Great Saiyaman.</i>

223
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:29,735
<i>His true identity...</i>
<i>won't ever get found out, will it...?</i>

224
00:22:34,325 --> 00:22:38,915
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

225
00:22:40,665 --> 00:22:45,505
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

226
00:22:49,715 --> 00:22:56,055
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

227
00:22:56,095 --> 00:23:02,185
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

228
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:09,195
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

229
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:14,575
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

230
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:18,415
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

231
00:23:18,455 --> 00:23:27,505
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

232
00:23:27,545 --> 00:23:29,045
<i>Even now?</i>

233
00:23:29,085 --> 00:23:36,675
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

234
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:42,055
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

235
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:48,565
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

236
00:23:48,605 --> 00:23:58,615
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

237
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:17,805
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

238
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:21,515
<i>This is unusual, Gohan.</i>
<i>You're walking around the city with a girl.</i>

239
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:23,305
<i>Is this one of those "date" things?</i>

240
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:25,895
<i>Of all things, Gohan-kun's secret got out,</i>

241
00:24:25,935 --> 00:24:29,355
<i>and to keep her from revealing it,</i>
<i>he has to go out with her.</i>

242
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:31,485
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

243
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:34,325
<i>"Gohan's Frantic First Date!?"</i>

244
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:38,575
<i>Dates are even tougher</i>
<i>than putting down bad guys.</i>

245
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:39,695
"Next time"
"Gohan's Frantic First Date!?"
