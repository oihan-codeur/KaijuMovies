00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,830

3
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,140
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,450
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:52,320
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,830
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:04,840
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,310
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,820
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12

<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,330
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,200
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,110
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,080
Do it!

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,620
<i>Makankosappo!</i>

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,100
<i>Sacrificing his own life, Goku saved</i>
<i>the Earth and his own son from Raditz.</i>

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,070
<i>However, the death of Raditz</i>

20
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,710
<i>has caused the two strongest</i>
<i>Saiyans to head for Earth.</i>

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,340
<i>One year remains before they arrive.</i>

22
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,760
This dying stuff...
it's pretty nasty... ain't it?

23
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,560
Don't worry, Goku! We'll
bring you back to life right away!

24
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,370
I'm... counting... on it...

25
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,570
Goku...

26
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,610
Goku!

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,840
He vanished!

28
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:03,380
<i>"Even Yama-sama is Surprised –</i>
<i>The Fight Continues in the Next World."</i>

29
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,490
He vanished?

30
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,300
This is Kami's doing, I'll bet.

31
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,900
This is something he would be capable of.

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,570
I wonder what he
intends to do with him.

33
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,070
Nevertheless, if it is
Kami<i>-sama</i>, then we can relax.

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,320
In any case, we need to hurry
and gather the other six balls,

35
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,890
and bring Goku back to life.

36
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,820
Good grief!
At a critical time like this,

37
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,060
I wonder where Yamucha
and the others have gone off to!

38
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,890
You were the one who
chased him away, weren't you?

39
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,830
But then again, how did Son<i>-kun</i>'s
brother know where he was so easily?

40
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,540
It's that strange device
he has attached to his face.

41
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,950
It seems to be able to tell an
opponent's strength and location.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,480
Kuririn?

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,480
Right.

44
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,080
Here.

45
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,290
That thing, huh?
Kuririn, remove it, would you?

46
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,270
S-Sure. H-He's not about to
come back to life or anything, right?

47
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,330
So this here does that...

48
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,130
This is an incredible mechanism!

49
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,400
It's a little bit damaged, but
I think I can do something with it.

50
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,470
You sure are incredible, Bulma<i>-san.</i>

51
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,880
Once I take this back, study it,
and make some alterations,

52
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,480
we just might be able to find out

53
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,080
where Yamucha and
Tenshinhan and the others are.

54
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,920
Whatever we do, let's go back to
the Kame House for the time being.

55
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,920
Right. There's nothing
more we can do here, huh?

56
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,060
Okay then, right after that,
I'll go looking for the Dragon Balls.

57
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,930
Piccolo, what do you plan to–

58
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,490
Just like a lizard's tail!

59
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,860
You guys search for the Dragon Balls.

60
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,830
Kami doesn't have the kind
of power it takes to restore life.

61
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:00,030
However, I'm going to be taking
charge of Son Goku's son there.

62
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,470
What?

63
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,470
You're kidding, right?!
What do you plan to do with him?!

64
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,870
I know what it is!

65
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,840
You're planning to eat him, huh?!

66
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,010
Eat him?!

67
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,010
W-What are you going to do?

68
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,610
This Gohan kid should give us
some powerful fighting potential,

69
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,280
depending on the training he gets.

70
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,690
For us to confront the two Saiyans
who are to arrive here in another year,

71
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,750
we're going to need his power.

72
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,730
To that end, I'm going
to have to train him.

73
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,230
Y-You can't seriously be saying that...

74
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,370
I'm not sure if that's going
to be agreeable, you know?

75
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,810
We'll first have to take it up with
Goku, as well as his mother, Chichi...

76
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,440
We don't have the
time to spare for that!

77
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,780
Keep up that bickering, and I'll take him
away, even if it means killing you to do so!

78
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,060
After a year has passed, I'll be coming
to your house, together with this kid.

79
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,370
When Son Goku comes back to life,

80
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,270
tell him he can wait
in expectation until then.

81
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,910
I don't know...
I don't know about this...

82
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,080
He's going to die! Even if he's lucky,
he's still going to become a delinquent!

83
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,990
Goku and Chichi<i>-san</i>
are going to be upset.

84
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,960
<i>And so, about that same</i>
<i>time, in the Other World...</i>

85
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,270
Okay, okay, all of you spirits,

86
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:43,900
please remain orderly in line!

87
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,210
Okay, you there! Do not form two lines!

88
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,180
Be sure to maintain
one orderly line, please!

89
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,230
...and that is why I have brought
him here as flesh and blood,

90
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,660
to ask that he be allowed to train.

91
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:18,670
If you please, Great King Yama<i>-sama,</i>
allow him to call on Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

92
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,480
Son Goku, huh? Indeed, his
achievements have been outstanding.

93
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,180
So you're asking that someone

94
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,080
who could go to heaven be
allowed to put himself at risk of danger,

95
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,080
travel the Serpentine Road,
and meet with Kaio<i>-sama</i>, then?

96
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,290
Yes.

97
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,490
Say, does everyone
come here when they die?

98
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,490
That's right.

99
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,930
Even aliens?

100
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,200
Mm-hmm. All who die have
judgment passed upon them here,

101
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,100
to determine whether they
are to go to heaven or hell.

102
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,130
Hey! Just a little bit before me,
did a guy named Raditz wash up here?

103
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:56,210
N-Now look here! You need
to say "did he come through?"

104
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,310
He was here, all right.
He was your brother, huh?

105
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,480
He's now hell-bound, of course.

106
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,050
Didn't he raise a commotion?

107
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:11,030
He did, he did! He did raise a
commotion, but I put him down!

108
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,330
You sure are strong, huh? You
took care of somebody that awesome?

109
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,900
Maybe I should get Pops here to train me!

110
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,800
Shh! Your voice is too loud!

111
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,240
You shouldn't be addressing
Yama<i>-sama</i> in that tone!

112
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,700
But...

113
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,110
Keep quiet! Kaio<i>-sama</i> is even stronger.

114
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,880
I heard that, Kami of Earth!

115
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,550
When you die, maybe
I ought to send you to hell.

116
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,890
P-Please forgive me! Surely, I never
thought that would reach your ears!

117
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,160
I should have expected as much of
someone who has "the devil's own ears."

118
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,890
Just kidding!

119
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,940
You've got no sense of humor, huh?

120
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,110
Nope.

121
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,110
Very well. If you wish to go that badly,

122
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,250
you may go to where Kaio<i>-sama</i> is.

123
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,250
T-Thank you very much.

124
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:14,590
I'll call a guide over for you.
Leave through there and wait for him.

125
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,820
Okay!

126
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,390
However... I can't be responsible for
you if you fall from the Serpentine Road.

127
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,240
All right then, good luck. This
whole year will be a challenge, after all.

128
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:34,270
Right! I ain't sure what's going on,

129
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,310
but anyhow, I'll go see this Kaio<i>-sama</i> guy.

130
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:42,780
Thanks! Say hi to Mister Popo for me!

131
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,320
<i>Then again, our Earth has drawn the</i>
<i>attention of some rather egregious folks.</i>

132
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,930
<i>We might indeed be in for</i>
<i>some real trouble this time.</i>

133
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,400
<i>Even if we were to petition</i>
<i>Shen Long to dispose of them,</i>

134
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,070
<i>he probably wouldn't be able to win out</i>

135
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,770
<i>against the incredible power of the Saiyans.</i>

136
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,840
<i>Even if Son Goku does</i>
<i>get trained by Kaio-sama,</i>

137
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,240
<i>just how much will he improve?</i>

138
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,420
<i>Our one and only salvation is Goku's son.</i>
<i>How is Piccolo going to raise Son Gohan?</i>

139
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,420
<i>And in this limited time, how will–</i>

140
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,250
Shut up!

141
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,890
You're disturbing me!
Would you go home already?!

142
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,030
Hey, what's taking so long?

143
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,500
E-Excuse me! Please excuse me!

144
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,770
Thank you for your patience.

145
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:45,540
I will now guide you to
where the Head of the Serpent is.

146
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:52,020
The Serpentine Road is very long!
Are you in healthy shape?

147
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,220
Nope. I'm dead, so I ain't in
very healthy shape at all, am I?

148
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,490
Say, what kind of person is Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

149
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,300
Ah yes, Kaio<i>-sama</i> is the gentleman

150
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,270
that stands above all the
Kami<i>-sama</i> throughout the universe.

151
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,270
I'm sure he must be strong, then!

152
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,760
We can't very well <i>not</i> say
anything about this to Chichi.

153
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,100
Kuririn, go on over there and
explain the situation to her for us.

154
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,300
M-Me?!

155
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,940
She appears to be an education-minded-mama,
so you're going to get killed for sure.

156
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,290
Hello? Hello?

157
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:07,090
Aloha! Turtle<i>-chan</i> is currently not at home.

158
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,900
If there's something I can do for you,
please wait until the sound of the beep–

159
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,730
Well, I never!
Where have they gone off to?!

160
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,770
And here I've come all
this way to see my grandson...

161
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,310
Knowin' Goku<i>-sa</i> and those others,

162
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,550
they're teachin' Gohan how to do
somethin' dangerous, I'm sure of it!

163
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,120
Well, that's okay, ain't it?
Children should be a li'l bit naughty.

164
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,920
Nothin' doin'!

165
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,560
If they're up to that and his mind goes
numb on him, then what are we goin' to do?!

166
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,790
Don't be silly!

167
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,160
No, if he goes learnin' the martial arts,

168
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,100
before long, he'll get kicked
in the chin or somethin',

169
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,600
and he'll get himself
thrown into the ocean!

170
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:55,010
And then, and then, a man-eater
will catch his scent, or perhaps,

171
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,980
he'll drift ashore to
some uninhabited island!

172
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,580
He'll get hungry, and as he's
tryin' to grab some bananas,

173
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,950
he'll get bitten by a snake,

174
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,520
and the poison will circulate
to his brain, and then... and then...

175
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,020
after his mind has gone
numb, what will we do?!

176
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,640
Okay, we're here.

177
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,520
This is the Serpentine Road, then?

178
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,580
Yes.

179
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,050
What do I do from here?

180
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,560
Earnestly press on as you travel
along this serpent, if you please.

181
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
It leads to where Kaio<i>-sama</i> is. Yes indeed.

182
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,470
It sure looks long.

183
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,240
Yes. According to legend, it's
approximately one million kilometers long.

184
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,310
A million kilometers?! Has
anyone ever reached the end?

185
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,910
As I recall, in the last billion years,

186
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,080
Great King Yama has
been the only one, yes indeed.

187
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,920
That older guy, huh?

188
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,890
Well, even so, as long as there's
someone who has reached the end,

189
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,890
I might be able to manage something too.

190
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,100
Please be absolutely careful
not to fall off into the clouds.

191
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,530
After all, beneath the clouds is where
hell is, and you will never return again.

192
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,400
Oh, really?

193
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,740
Rats, I should have brought
a <i>bento</i> lunch or something.

194
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,410
That's all right, sir.
You are already dead,

195
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,120
so I doubt there's any chance of
you starving to death. Yes indeed.

196
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,590
Oh, yeah!

197
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,450
Okay, then...

198
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,930
Oh, that's right!
I have a favor I'd like to ask!

199
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,260
Do you know Uranai Baba?

200
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,430
Yes. She comes by once in a while.

201
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,900
Thank goodness!
The next time she comes, right?

202
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:08,240
Ask her to tell Old Timer Turtle Hermit not
to bring me back to life for one year for me.

203
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:16,620
Understood. Let's see, one year...
the Turtle Hermit<i>-sama</i>, right?

204
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,950
Okay, guess I'll go now.

205
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,920
So in short, all I have to do
is not fall off the snake, right?

206
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,320
Yes, be sure not to.

207
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,990
<i>Bukujutsu!</i>

208
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,970
That's cheating...

209
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,120
Wake up already, son of Son Goku!

210
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,670
We need to talk.
Come up out of the water!

211
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,340
Who are you? Father?

212
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:28,580
Father! Where are you?!
Save me! Father! Father!

213
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:35,130
Father! I'm scared! I'm scared!

214
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,030
Sheesh, you dirty brat!

215
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400
Don't give me any trouble!

216
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,710
Stop your bawling! If you don't
get quiet, I'm going to snap your neck!

217
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,950
Ready? Listen close to what I have to say.

218
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,060
First, your father has died.

219
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,530
You remember a little bit of that,
right? In order to defeat that man,

220
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,300
he sacrificed himself.

221
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,310
R-Run away, Gohan!
Run away!

222
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,740
Father...

223
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,450
Whoa, now, don't you cry!
I really will snap your neck!

224
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,120
You've heard about the
Dragon Balls from your father, right?

225
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,590
Goku's friends should be
gathering them to bring him back to life.

226
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,100
However, that's not what the problem is.

227
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:50,030
We managed to deal with
the guy who kidnapped you,

228
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,140
but in a year from now,

229
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:54,870
it seems that some even more
terrible friends of his will be coming.

230
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:57,640
Once they do, then even with
having Son Goku returned to life,

231
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,110
there's absolutely no chance of
us winning with just him and myself.

232
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,920
We need your power too. Train
yourself to learn the tactics of fighting,

233
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,620
and defend the Earth!

234
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,620
Me? You can't mean it!
I can't fight at all!

235
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,890
Apparently, you still
haven't realized it yourself.

236
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,930
The power that you have
locked within you is something else.

237
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,600
That's why we're going to
draw out that power through training,

238
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,630
until you can use it effectively.

239
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,010
It can't be... I don't
have any power like that.

240
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,680
You want to see some proof?

241
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,910
W-What are you doing?!

242
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,150
Ow! That hurts!
That hurts! Stop it! That hurts!

243
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,620
That hurts! Stop it!
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

244
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,890
Here you go!

245
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,360
Come on! Show me that
power you have locked away!

246
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,990
W-What the–?

247
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,100
<i>W-What a surprise!</i>
<i>This is more than I imagined!</i>

248
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,610
<i>I've got mixed feelings about this.</i>

249
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,910
<i>Here I am about to raise someone</i>

250
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,780
<i>who could turn out to be my</i>
<i>most fearsome opponent in the future.</i>

251
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,020
That's... what I did?

252
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:48,420
That's right. Looks like you've
more or less realized it now.

253
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,090
When your emotions
become considerably raised,

254
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:55,530
the natural power that you have
locked up inside you is exhibited.

255
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,330
However, it only lasts for an instant.
We can't beat them like that!

256
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,530
I'm going to drill into you the way to fight,

257
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,040
and turn you into the greatest
warrior ever. You got that?

258
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,240
But I don't want to
learn to be a martial artist.

259
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,880
I want to be a great scholar.

260
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,550
So become one. Just do it after
we've defeated the two Saiyans

261
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,050
who will be coming in a year.

262
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,250
They're planning to
exterminate every person on Earth.

263
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,890
If they do that, your future's
not going to be worth crap, is it?

264
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,890
But I'm scared...

265
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:31,560
Stop your griping!
You want to get killed right now?!

266
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,230
We don't have time!
We're going to begin right now!

267
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,830
Take off your tunic immediately!

268
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,140
Once Father comes back to life,
I want to be taught by Father.

269
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,650
That's too bad. He certainly is strong,

270
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:52,880
but he's not at all cut out to be a teacher.

271
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,920
He doesn't have any of the
firmness it takes to handle others.

272
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,990
You can easily tell that just by
looking at how spoiled <i>you</i> are!

273
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,500
Huh?

274
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,770
Uh oh, I've used up too much
strength, and now I can't fly any more.

275
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,570
<i>His own son's grief aside,</i>

276
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:26,280
<i>Goku presses on in earnest along the long</i>
<i>road in search of Kaio-sama's guidance.</i>

277
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,870
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

278
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:53,740
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

279
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,120
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

280
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,620
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

281
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:11,090
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

282
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,200
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

283
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,700
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

284
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,370
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

285
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,880
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

286
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,950
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

287
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,790
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

288
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,860
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

289
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,530
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

290
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,700
<i>So sorry.</i>

291
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,800
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

292
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,780
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

293
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,090
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

294
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:19,130
<i>Whoa, how long does this road</i>
<i>go on? I can't see where the end is!</i>

295
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,100
<i>Father!</i>

296
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,240
<i>Don't act so spoiled! You hold</i>
<i>the fate of the earth in your hands!</i>

297
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,100
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

298
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,710
<i>"Survival with Dinosaurs!</i>
<i>Gohan's Harsh Training"</i>

299
