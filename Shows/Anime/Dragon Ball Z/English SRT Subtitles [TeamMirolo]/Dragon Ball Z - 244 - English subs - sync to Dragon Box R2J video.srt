<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,110
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,740
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,040
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,750
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,380

<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,690
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,700

<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,090
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,920
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,180
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

<i>Gohan has at length pulled out the Z-Sword,</i>

24
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,030
<i>the legendary blade of the Kaioshin Realm,</i>

25
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,450
<i>said to be able to defeat even Majin Boo.</i>

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,920
<i>On Earth, as part of Babidi's plan</i>
<i>to call out Piccolo and the others,</i>

27
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,130
<i>Majin Boo continued over and over</i>
<i>to turn people into candy and eat them.</i>

28
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,980
Let's do this Fusion training properly!

29
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,990
<i>To defeat Majin Boo,</i>

30
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:53,330
<i>Goten and Trunks have decided to</i>
<i>master the Fusion merging technique.</i>

31
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,000
<i>"Metro West is Targeted!</i>
<i>Stop, Majin Boo!!"</i>

32
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,980
Okay, there ain't much time!
Goten, Trunks, let's begin!

33
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,980
Hm? What's wrong?

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,990
So, is this Fusion thing
really an awesome technique?

35
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,160
You'll see once you try it!

36
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,990
Somehow I don't expect
much from this old guy.

37
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,000
I mean, he was unconscious
as Papa was getting killed!

38
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,170
Quickly, both of you become Super Saiyan!

39
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,710
O-Okay.

40
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,850
All right. Now, raise
your <i>ki</i> to their upper limits!

41
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,390
Full-blast, now.

42
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,980
Okay, let's surprise them, Goten!

43
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Yeah!

44
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,700
W-What?

45
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,540
What's this?

46
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,630
These <i>ki</i>... Goten and Trunks? Incredible!

47
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,300
Naturally! He's Vegeta's son, after all!

48
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,020
Those kids could do it. Fusion.

49
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,650
Yes.

50
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,080
Ho, when did they get as strong as this?

51
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,920
All right, that's full-on, right?

52
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,960
Y-Yeah...

53
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,260
Trunks, your <i>ki</i> is just a little bit larger.

54
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,930
For you to do Fusion, you have to
completely match your <i>ki</i> together.

55
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,310
Trunks, hold your <i>ki</i> down just a little bit

56
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,560
and make it the same as Goten's.

57
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
Th-The same?

58
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,110
About like this?

59
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,110
That's too small.
Raise it a little more...

60
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,950
a little more... a little more...

61
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:44,120
Stop! That's it! Remember
the size of that <i>ki</i> well.

62
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,670
Okay, go back to normal.

63
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,170
That sure is hard.

64
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,970
Why is it that I'm the one
who has to match up with Goten?

65
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,470
Sorry, Trunks-<i>kun.</i>

66
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,100
It can't be helped, you know. Don't complain,
you're a whole year older than Goten, right?

67
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,310
Hold on there, Son-<i>kun</i>!

68
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,150
I heard that just now!

69
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,610
Don't you go doing
anything to stunt Trunks' talents!

70
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,110
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

71
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,490
Out of my way!

72
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,120
You can't interfere in their training!

73
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,200
Let go of me!

74
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,120
Look, just leave this up to Goku and Piccolo!

75
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,040
What are you doing?!

76
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,500
Good grief!

77
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,550
Put me down! Kuririn!

78
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:34,550
Kuririn!

79
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,180
Let Goku handle this!

80
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,180
Yeah, I know!

81
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,050
I just wanted to take a
second to say that! Indeed!

82
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,520
Trunks-kun, I'm going to try hard,
so let's do it one more time!

83
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,860
Hm? Okay.

84
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,190
Fusion, huh? If it were me and Goku...

85
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:08,370
Kuririn, that's too big! Match up with Goku!

86
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,930
Goku! Hurry and become more like me!

87
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,970
Well, who's to say that
wouldn't have happened?

88
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:34,900
That's right! The only one left that
can protect the Earth is me, Satan!

89
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,450
I don't mean saving little fish,
and I don't mean saving big fish!

90
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,530
I'm here to save the Earth,
where all of you live!

91
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,540
You'll see, I will surely save us
from the hands of Majin Boo!!

92
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,870
This I now swear to you!

93
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,880
–Way to go, Satan!
–We're counting on you!

94
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,130
Good luck!

95
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,300
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
I now return to my harsh, bitter training!

96
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,590
However, I will endure any
training, no matter how harsh!

97
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,600
And so, briefly, until we meet again,
ladies and gentlemen, farewell!

98
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:14,270
Satan! Satan! Satan!

99
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,740
<i>That went over so well it scares me.</i>

100
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,240
<i>But you know, if Majin Boo were to</i>
<i>come while I'm in the middle of training,</i>

101
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,120
<i>I'm screwed.</i>

102
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,950
<i>I won't be able to</i>
<i>teach them any lessons.</i>

103
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,290
<i>But, since I'm in training, there's</i>
<i>nothing I'll be able to do about it.</i>

104
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:39,760
–I'll get him!
–Satan! Satan! Satan!

105
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,370
The terrible Majin Boo
threatens to destroy the Earth!

106
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:59,210
And yet, where are Ma Junior,
Trunks, and Son Goten,

107
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:02,590
whom Majin Boo and Babidi seek,
and what are they doing?

108
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,050
This isn't any laughing matter!

109
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,260
If they don't show themselves quickly,
it'll mean trouble for us!

110
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:13,390
Trunks?

111
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,940
Trunks! Knock a hole in his
dumb-looking face right away!

112
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,950
It couldn't be! Not that hateful little brat!

113
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,870
I don't want to die over that brat!

114
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,870
I have to hurry and tell where he lives!

115
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,250
Mama, I'm sure his house is in Metro West!

116
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,250
Really?

117
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,250
Yep.

118
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,090
Okay then. Idasa-<i>chan</i>, Ikose-<i>chan</i>, listen up.

119
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,340
Everyone concentrate together.

120
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,240
Where shall we go now?

121
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,240
Babidi! Babidi! Can you hear me?

122
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,790
What's this?

123
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,790
Trunks lives at the Capsule
Corporation in Metro West.

124
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,250
I want you to quickly go and
put him to some terrible fate!

125
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,800
Who is this?

126
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,970
Me? I'm on the board of the PTA.

127
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:30,300
I don't usually tattle on people like this,

128
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,140
but that uncouth, snotty little turd

129
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,850
cheated during his matches earlier today.

130
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,480
In those matches, both Idasa-<i>chan</i>
and Ikose-<i>chan</i> were running fevers,

131
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,270
and not in their best condition.

132
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:47,820
Otherwise, there's no way my refined
sons would have lost to those brats!

133
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,950
Shut up! I'm grateful for your information,

134
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,540
but just you try talking to me
in that shrill voice of yours again!

135
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,710
I'll kill you!

136
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:06,760
Well, I never! And after I told
him everything! How dreadful!

137
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,350
Okay, next, raise your <i>ki</i> all the
way to the top in your regular forms.

138
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:19,520
Starting out with Fusion as
Super Saiyans is pretty hard, after all.

139
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,730
People of Earth!

140
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,530
I just received some significant information.

141
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,530
It seems that one of those three urchins, Trunks,

142
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:40,910
lives in a house called the
Capsule Corporation, in Metro West.

143
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,550
Perhaps we should go and see him.
You'd better come on out!

144
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,430
Otherwise, the city where
you live will cease to exist!

145
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,080
Damn! Who ratted me out?

146
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,580
Grandpa and Grandma are still at home!

147
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,620
Trunks-<i>kun...</i>

148
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,790
Son-<i>kun</i>, did you hear that just now?

149
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,800
Papa and Mama are going to be killed!

150
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,300
It's okay, we can bring them
back to life with the Dragon Balls.

151
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,300
Metro West is also going to be destroyed!

152
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,310
We can return that to
normal too, with the second wish.

153
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,850
No, we can't.

154
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,810
After using the first wish to bring a
large number of people back to life,

155
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,610
only one more wish will remain.

156
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,700
Now that you mention it, that's right.

157
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,370
In that case, you could just tell Shen Long

158
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:06,630
to "Return everything back the way
it was" or something, couldn't you?

159
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,630
There you go.

160
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,170
Yeah? How about that?

161
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,680
No, wait! I'm not sure
things would go too smoothly.

162
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,890
Son-<i>kun</i>, it really will be
bad if Metro West is destroyed!

163
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,390
The Dragon Radar will also be lost!

164
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,690
That is a problem.

165
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,530
Okay. Trunks, you return
home as fast as you can,

166
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,950
get the Radar, and bring it back for us!

167
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,040
I will delay Majin Boo
and Babidi for a little while.

168
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,500
W-Will you be all right?
Uncle, can you delay them?

169
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,170
Won't you get beaten right away?

170
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,170
Well, if it's just for a little while,
I can manage something.

171
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:57,590
Never mind me, hurry! Or else
they'll reach Metro West first!

172
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:03,230
Trunks, be careful! If it gets
dangerous, come right back here!

173
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,600
Okay!

174
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,060
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, good luck!

175
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,310
Got it!

176
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,070
<i>Is everything really going to be all right?</i>

177
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,410
Oh well.

178
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,880
All right, time to fly!

179
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,270
Trunks is going to come
back safely. Don't worry, Bulma.

180
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,600
But still...

181
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,270
He'll be okay, I said.

182
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:54,940
He's your and Vegeta's son, after all.

183
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,510
Son-<i>kun...</i>

184
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,850
Now then, where are those two?

185
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,950
Goten, just sit tight for a bit, okay?

186
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,660
Right!

187
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,960
That's a good boy.

188
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,970
Okay, there they are.

189
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,470
Hey, see here! You're flying too fast!

190
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,720
I'm almost falling off, you know! You moron!

191
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,160
Idiot! Don't get sidetracked, go to Metro West!

192
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,120
Why did you suddenly stop?!

193
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,920
Yo!

194
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,920
You!

195
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,850
So that's it. Here I thought
you'd been killed by Vegeta,

196
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,810
but you're still alive, huh?

197
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,810
You know, I have to thank you.
As you can see, thanks to you,

198
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,850
Majin Boo has returned!

199
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,150
Both Vegeta and I looked
too lightly upon you.

200
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,780
How could we have known that
Majin Boo would be this awesome?

201
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,070
We didn't think this could be possible.

202
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,460
Of course he is! My Papa made him, you know!

203
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,710
So, what is it? Why have you come here?

204
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,850
I know, you've come to
tell me where those three are!

205
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,060
You can't mean that.
One of the three is my own son.

206
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,900
I just came to give you a warning.

207
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:03,530
Warning? A warning, you say?
To us? This is most amusing.

208
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,410
I know, why don't I let
everyone on Earth hear this.

209
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:16,540
Listen here, those three are definitely
going to show themselves in the near future.

210
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,880
I promise.

211
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,550
So just wait until then!

212
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,880
Stop the unnecessary destruction
and picking on the weak!

213
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,390
Why should we wait?
Are they planning something?

214
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,930
Yeah. They're in special
training in order to defeat you.

215
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,400
To defeat us, you say?!

216
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,740
They could train for a thousand
years and nothing would come of it!

217
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,280
Sure about that?

218
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,080
You expect us to wait for that?
They can come here right now!

219
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,710
Otherwise, we keep killing Earthlings!

220
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:06,970
After all, we're enjoying
these acts of destruction!

221
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,100
I'll bet. That's what I thought you'd say.

222
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,770
Well then, you'll have to let
me oppose you for just a little bit.

223
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:22,110
Interesting! Boo, show him
just how terrifying you are!

224
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,030
He seems to want to
die just as Vegeta did!

225
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,240
What's wrong?

226
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,290
Why, you...

227
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:46,300
Hey, Majin Boo! What are
you doing?! Go, get him!

228
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,680
Come on, show him
your power! Hey! Come on!

229
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,010
Okay, okay.

230
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,520
What's wrong with you?

231
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,150
You're that strong, yet you're
still under Babidi's thumb?

232
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,660
Majin Boo! Quiet, you!
Don't go saying anything funny!

233
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,790
Majin Boo is my servant!

234
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,040
Of course he listens to what I tell him to do!

235
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:23,130
W-What? Do you want me to use
the spell and seal you up again?

236
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,210
If you seal me up, you're
gonna be killed by him!

237
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:38,350
<i>W-Why you, when did you come</i>
<i>by such uncalled-for wisdom?</i>

238
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:44,110
But I'll kill him for you.
I hate him for acting goody-goody.

239
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:48,110
Sheesh, guess there's nothing left to do.

240
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,070
How should I kill you?

241
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,870
Watch very closely, Earthlings!

242
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,750
We're about to show you what happens
to any fool that tries to go against us!

243
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,920
Here goes!

244
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,560
Is this... Father's <i>ki</i>?!

245
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,730
That's right! Your father is one incredible guy!

246
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:28,730
I-It can't be...

247
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,240
Th-That old guy and Papa have
about the same amount of power!

248
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,410
Awesome!

249
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,080
Useless! Useless!

250
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,000
Vegeta did that, and he still got killed!

251
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,470
Well, shall I see about going
once more beyond a Super Saiyan

252
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,140
that's gone beyond Super Saiyan?

253
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:02,770
Go even beyond Super-whatever
that's gone beyond Super-whatever?

254
00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:06,020
Goku... What are you talking about?

255
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:13,240
<i>What's this? Go beyond even a Super</i>
<i>Saiyan that's gone beyond Super Saiyan?</i>

256
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:26,830
<i>Can Goku obstruct Majin Boo</i>
<i>until Trunks reaches Metro West?</i>

257
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,970
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

258
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,560
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

259
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:56,110
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

260
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:02,240
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

261
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:09,250
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

262
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:14,630
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

263
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,470
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

264
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:27,560
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

265
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,110
<i>Even now?</i>

266
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:36,740
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

267
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,120
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

268
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,620
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

269
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:58,630
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

270
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,780
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

271
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,570
<i>Majin Boo, Babidi, this is the</i>
<i>transformation beyond Super Saiyan</i>

272
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,410
<i>that's already gone beyond</i>
<i>Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 3!</i>

273
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,750
<i>Stop, Goku! If you do that,</i>

274
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,250
<i>your remaining time on earth will disappear!</i>

275
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,080
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

276
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,590
<i>"An Astounding, Great Transformation!!</i>
<i>Super Saiyan 3."</i>

277
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:37,800
<i>F-Father, that is some</i>
<i>unbelievably incredible power!</i>

278
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,760
"Next time"
"An Astounding, Great Transformation!!
Super Saiyan 3"
