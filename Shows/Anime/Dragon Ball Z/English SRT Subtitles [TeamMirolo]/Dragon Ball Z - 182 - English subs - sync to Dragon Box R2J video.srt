It's your turn, Gohan!

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,190
What nonsense.

22
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,200
Let him have it, Gohan.
Bring peace back to the world.

23
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,570
You wanted to be a scholar, right?

24
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,160
Understood! I'll do it!

25
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,480
I'll kill him immediately!

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,320
Look how wrong you were, Son Goku!

27
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,610
Thanks to your misdirected
thinking, your son will die!

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,160
Goku-<i>san</i>!

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,580
Hey, Goku! Hey!

30
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,960
<i>Gohan can win this. I'm sure of it!</i>

<i>"Become Enraged Gohan –</i>
<i>Call Forth Your Dormant Power."</i>

32
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,330
Yours is nothing more than
a foolish struggle, Son Gohan.

33
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,850
G-Gohan...

34
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,980
Gohan!

35
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,900
Gohan-<i>chan</i>! There's no helpin' Goku-<i>sa</i>!

36
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,160
Up until now, he's always just
disregarded me, and went off fightin'!

37
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,410
I've given up hope on him!
But as for Gohan-<i>chan</i>...!

38
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,170
And here, after all the times
I've warned him about this...!

39
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,750
Gohan! Don't you go
fightin' that monster-like guy!

40
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,590
Gohan! Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

41
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,920
Chichi, simmer down!

42
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,180
I-Is that child really planning to fight Cell?

43
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,810
The same Cell that we were no match for?

44
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,670
You brat!

45
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,390
The young boy who was
thought to be selling <i>bento</i> lunches

46
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,230
is fighting for some reason!

47
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:46,360
However, Cell has overwhelming superiority!

48
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,440
The young boy is just running away from him!

49
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,740
I-Is it okay for that child to be fighting?

50
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,030
It's crazy! It's outrageous!

51
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,850
Monarch, the military
preparations have been completed.

52
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,230
We'll get that guy for sure this time!

53
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,850
It's futile.

54
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:32,240
With that monster Cell's power, there's
nothing our military can do against him.

55
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,240
B-But...!

56
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,410
The young man who saved the
Earth before fought him and lost.

57
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:46,790
And now, the person who that young man
designated with full confidence is now fighting.

58
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,760
In that event, we too will entrust
everything to that young boy.

59
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,090
The fate of Earth rests in
the fight that boy puts up.

60
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,450
Up to now, Gohan hasn't...!

61
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,620
Gohan-<i>san</i>...!

62
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,130
Gohan!

63
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,970
Son Gohan, if you must blame someone,

64
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:41,640
blame your own father for roping
you into this ill-advised battle!

65
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,790
G-Gohan-<i>san...</i>

66
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,080
H-How horrible!

67
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,920
Maybe I overdid that a little.

68
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,260
That was a bit immature on my part.

69
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,430
Chichi! Chichi! Hold it together!

70
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,900
H-How could this be?

71
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,410
The <i>bento</i> salesboy recklessly challenged Cell,
a-and has lost his young life!

72
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,830
I-Is he dead?

73
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,290
Poor thing!

74
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,720
Goku! You're responsible for this!

75
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,350
You've completely underestimated the situation!

76
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,890
Everyone warned you about this!

77
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,730
Goku, you're the one who killed Gohan!!

78
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,950
Take it easy, Piccolo.

79
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,490
Gohan's <i>ki</i> ain't dropped in the least, has it?

80
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,790
It's true!

81
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,420
Now then, Son Goku, the absurd jokes are over.

82
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,380
Take one of those <i>senzu</i>, and fight me again!

83
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,550
You idiot!

84
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,380
Take a good look behind you!

85
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,300
What?

86
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,440
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

87
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,990
You're alive, Gohan?!

88
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,140
This is a surprise.

89
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,770
You're exceptionally tough, aren't you?

90
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:33,600
L-Let's stop this already.

91
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,850
This fight is meaningless.

92
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,320
Are you losing your nerve, kid?!

93
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,200
Of all the things you could have said,

94
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,950
you're telling me to put
a stop to the Cell Games

95
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,660
because they're meaningless?

96
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,870
Yeah.

97
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,120
There is meaning to them!
For me, this is a pastime.

98
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,460
I am going to defeat you,
and then little by little,

99
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,130
I will take my time to kill all of humanity.

100
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,300
If you wish to save the Earth...

101
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,220
I-I really don't want to fight you.

102
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,970
I don't want to kill you.

103
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,310
Even though you're as evil as you are...

104
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:15,730
W-What's Gohan saying?

105
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,730
He's speaking so softly, I can't pick it up.

106
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,730
W-What are you getting on the long-range mike?

107
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,730
I-I can't make anything out.

108
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,360
I don't like fighting and
stuff the way Father does.

109
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,450
I can understand well enough
why you don't like to fight.

110
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,000
But I can't understand
what you mean by saying

111
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,460
you wouldn't want to kill me.

112
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,920
You couldn't kill me in a hundred years!

113
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,720
How about it? Am I wrong?

114
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,520
I'm beginning to understand more
and more why it is that Father said

115
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,890
I'm the only one who could defeat you, Cell.

116
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,210
What is this?

117
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,040
You say you can defeat me?

118
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,050
Ever since I was little,
whenever I flew into a rage,

119
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,130
things have happened
that not even I understood.

120
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,930
The first time I realized it

121
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,100
was when the Saiyan Raditz
came from space to attack us.

122
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,160
Indeed! Fools such as
yourself are quite uncommon!

123
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,580
To think that you would
be so completely taken in!

124
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:57,370
Just as I thought, there's no
way that you could be a warrior!

125
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,670
Th-That was dirty!

126
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,130
But I'm not like you. I'm a first-rate warrior!

127
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,300
I have absolutely no
hesitations about killing you,

128
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,470
even if you are my brother!

129
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,340
Shall I provide you with a sample?

130
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,350
Father...

131
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,650
There you go, there you go!

132
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,360
Suffer even more! Your death is near!

133
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,680
B-Battle power...

134
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:03,890
O-One thousand... one thousand
three hundred seven...?!

135
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,650
Stop picking on...

136
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,070
...my father!!

137
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,970
And when I was trained by Piccolo-<i>san...</i>

138
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,770
Stop your bawling!

139
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,890
If you don't get quiet,
I'm going to snap your neck!

140
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,270
Apparently, you still haven't realized it yourself.

141
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,940
The power that you have
locked within you is something else.

142
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,740
That's why we're going to draw
out that power through training,

143
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,950
until you can use it effectively.

144
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:00,120
It can't be... I don't have any power like that.

145
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,750
You want to see some proof?

146
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,460
W-What are you doing?!

147
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,630
Stop it! That hurts! That hurts! That hurts!

148
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,000
Here you go!

149
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,460
<i>Come on! Show me that</i>
<i>power you have locked away!</i>

150
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,780
W-What the...?

151
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,080
W-What a surprise!
This is more than I imagined!

152
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,630
When I went to Planet Namek,
and fought with Freeza...

153
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,510
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

154
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:14,150
You're thinking of saving him?

155
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,150
It's pointless, he'll die momentarily.

156
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,740
How about instead, you
worry about your own safety?

157
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,330
Out...

158
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,670
Out...

159
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,340
Out of my way!!

160
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,580
When I fly off the handle,
I seem to go beyond my own will,

161
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,580
and start fighting
hysterically with amazing power.

162
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,800
And now that I've trained in
the Room of Spirit and Time,

163
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,920
I've powered up.

164
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,470
Father took that into account...

165
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,970
But if it comes to that, I'm sure I will kill you.

166
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,810
That's an interesting story!

167
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,520
You blew it.

168
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:28,450
Did you think I would be
scared off by hearing that story?

169
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,080
You really are a brat.

170
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,670
On the contrary, now I want to
make you angry, no matter what.

171
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:38,210
I want to have a look at this
so-called hidden power you have!

172
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,590
Come on, come on, come on!

173
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,340
Come on, now...

174
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,350
G-Gohan-<i>san</i>!

175
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:53,350
Goku! Put a stop to this!

176
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,230
If you go in and fight in his
place, Cell will release Gohan!

177
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,030
Goku!

178
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,030
It's okay. Gohan can win.

179
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,450
Get angry, Gohan. Get angry.

180
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,370
Get angry! Get angry and
show me your true power!

181
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,020
Get angry!

182
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:40,190
Get angry! Get angry!
Get angry! Get angry! Get angry!

183
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:52,370
The <i>bento</i> salesboy is getting beaten up!

184
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,750
Cell's assault is all one-sided!

185
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,330
Can this boy escape the pinch he is in?

186
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,710
What do you say, Mister Satan?

187
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,920
Impossible. Not that <i>bento</i> salesboy.

188
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,180
If someone doesn't step
in and fight in place of him–

189
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,300
Oh! Then Mister Satan, you'll take his place?!

190
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,190
People of the world,
it appears that we will be able to see

191
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,060
the grandeur of Mister
Satan's fighting once again!

192
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,650
M-M-My stomach started hurting again!

193
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,740
Satan-<i>sama</i>...!

194
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,490
U-Unfortunately, it seems that
Mister Satan still has a stomachache.

195
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,380
A-Are we to just watch on as the
<i>bento</i> salesboy gets killed like this?!

196
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,590
Is there no one who can save him?!

197
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,770
Come on, get angry! Get angry,
and show me your true power!

198
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,200
C-Cell got knocked on his can!

199
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:48,940
Son Gohan, no matter what it takes,
I'm going to make you angry.

200
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,780
<i>That's right, Cell. That will be fine.</i>

201
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,620
<i>Make Gohan angry.</i>

202
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,330
<i>When that happens, you will</i>
<i>experience some true terror.</i>

203
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:09,500
<i>The key to the fate of Earth lies</i>
<i>in Gohan's grasp as he fights...</i>

204
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:16,680
<i>Will Gohan's hidden</i>
<i>power be able to burst forth?</i>

205
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,790
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

206
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,590
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

207
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:56,970
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

208
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,480
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

209
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,980
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

210
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,110
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

211
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:19,620
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

212
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:22,240
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

213
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,750
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

214
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,840
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

215
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,680
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

216
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,680
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

217
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,390
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

218
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,520
<i>So sorry.</i>

219
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,690
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

220
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,700
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

221
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,340
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

222
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,930
<i>Watch out, everybody!</i>
<i>Cell is sending something after us,</i>

223
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,840
<i>in order to get Gohan angry!</i>

224
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,850
<i>Whoa, what are those things?!</i>

225
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,640
<i>Little monsters are coming out of Cell's back!</i>

226
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

227
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,770
<i>"Teeny Menaces!!</i>
<i>Attack of the Cell Juniors."</i>

228
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:36,070
<i>Stop, Cell! Please stop!</i>
<i>I can't control my power yet!</i>

229
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,320
"Next time"
"Teeny Menaces!!
Attack of the Cell Juniors"
