Even if you were to go,
there's nothing you could do!

You'd just die for no reason!

Stop! It'll be the same if you go!

Did he still have some companions around?

Well, it's all the same, no matter
how many of those guys there are!

–Is he dead?
–Don't say such a stupid thing!

60
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,890
There's no reason Papa would
die from just this, you know!

61
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,890
B-But, it's impossible for him to fight anymore!

62
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,900
Get this, Goten! Pick out
your ears and listen well!

63
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:17,440
I heard this from my Mama.
Papa is–get this–the proud Saiyan prince!

64
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,450
A prince?!

65
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,080
That's right! My Papa is incredible!

66
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,910
You think the Saiyan prince would
be beaten by the likes of that guy?!

67
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,880
Ah, Papa!

68
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,590
Uncle!

69
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,590
T-Trunks...

70
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,860
What happened to him?!

71
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,990
Still alive, are you?

72
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,410
It would have been so much easier for you
if you had just died and gotten it over with.

73
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,450
You're such a fool!

74
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,790
My Majin Boo is invincible!

75
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,000
You'll be killed together with those pipsqueaks!

76
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,000
Majin Boo is reprehensible enough...

77
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,790
...but you're the most
reprehensible one of all, Babidi!

78
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,340
Y-You...!

79
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:29,020
You're as pallid as ever,
aren't you? You're green!

80
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,680
Well, it's no wonder,

81
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,020
now that you've seen the strength
of my Majin Boo's with your own eyes!

82
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,030
It's normal that your complexion
should change, you know!

83
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,110
My face is naturally this color.
Don't get so full of yourself!

84
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,030
You're just a lowly Madoshi!

85
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,870
W-What did you say?!

86
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,370
You've got a lot of nerve,
don't you, angering me so?!

87
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,960
All right, I'll have Majin Boo kill
you in the most painful way there is!

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,630
That's kind of you, but I must decline.

89
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:01,010
You can no longer be allowed
to make use of Majin Boo.

90
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,010
What?! I want you to stop your nonsense!

91
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,890
Majin Boo may be too much,
but I'll bet I could kill you!

92
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,600
Barrier!

93
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,860
How about that?! I can
manage a little bit too, you know!

94
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,200
Papparapa!

95
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,200
Majin Boo! Boo! Majin Boo!

96
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,120
What are you doing?! This one! Kill this one!

97
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,590
Are you sure you're able to kill me?

98
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:41,270
F-Fool! If you kill me, Majin Boo
can never be sealed up again!

99
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,780
I-If that happens,

100
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,950
Majin Boo will destroy the whole
universe until there's nothing left!

101
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,750
Is that okay with you?!

102
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,290
The same holds true even if
you aren't dead! Am I wrong?!

103
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,720
Die!

104
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:25,980
This can't be! I was
going to be king of the world!

105
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,770
Who did it?!! Who made this happen to me?!

106
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:25,420
Trunks, take good care of Bulma–your Mama...

107
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,260
W-What do you mean by that, Papa?

108
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,810
"Take care of your Mama?"

109
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,560
You guys go take shelter somewhere, far away.

110
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,700
I fight alone against Majin Boo!

111
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,830
U-Uncle?

112
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,290
No way! We're going to fight too!
Papa, you'll be killed fighting alone!

113
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,210
If the three of us fight,
we're sure to defeat him!

114
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,210
–Right, Goten?!
–Yeah!

115
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,380
We're strong, you know!

116
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,220
No chance. No matter how
many of us were to attack him...

117
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,850
in the usual manner of fighting, anyhow...

118
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,310
Uncle! If the three of us fight, it'll be easy, easy!

119
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,390
This isn't like you, Papa! Getting all pessimistic!

120
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,400
Yeah! Right, right!

121
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,150
Uncle, you have to always act like a big shot!

122
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,270
Yeah!

123
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,210
Trunks, from the time you were a baby,

124
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,290
I've never once given you a hug, have I?

125
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,260
Let me hug you.

126
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,850
P-Papa...!

127
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:27,390
W-What is it, Papa?

128
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,770
C-Cut it out! You're embarrassing me!

129
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,860
Take care, Trunks...

130
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,790
P-Papa...!

131
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,330
Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

132
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,290
Uncle, how come?!

133
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,290
How come you hit Trunks-<i>kun</i>?!

134
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,260
How come?! How come you hit Trunks-<i>kun</i>?!

135
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,350
That's awful! That's awful, Uncle! Uncle!

136
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,480
How come?!

137
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,080
Who was it that hit me just now?

138
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,460
Take these two and get as
far away as possible. Hurry.

139
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,060
I'm counting on you, Piccolo.

140
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,440
You intend to die, don't you?

141
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,460
Just tell me one thing.

142
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,760
Once I die,

143
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,260
will I be able to meet Kakarrot
again in the Other World, or wherever?

144
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,310
At a time like this, it's not going to
help for me to speak in consolation,

145
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,980
so I'll tell you directly–

146
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:06,610
That's not possible.

147
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,490
You've killed too many sinless people.

148
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,120
When you die, your body will become nothing,

149
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,960
and your spirit will be carried
to a different world than Goku's.

150
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:29,430
There, your spirit will be cleansed,
your memory will be lost,

151
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,640
and you will be changed into a new life form.

152
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,060
Is that so? Too bad.

153
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,160
That's enough. Get going, and hurry!

154
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,320
Yeah.

155
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,040
Look here! I won't let you get away!

156
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Hold it, Majin Boo!!

157
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,500
You take on them after you've defeated me!

158
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,510
Got that, you ugly balloon scum?!

159
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,140
You said something bad
about me again, didn't you?!

160
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,430
Even though you're a wimp!

161
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,020
You're a smart-aleck!

162
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,700
Hurry, Kuririn!

163
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,070
Hurry and get away from here!

164
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,700
R-Right!

165
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,700
You die, right now!

166
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,420
I'm really mad, you know!

167
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,760
I've figured out how to put you away, at last!

168
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,610
H-Hey!

169
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,740
What is Vegeta planning to do?

170
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,450
Like that, there's no
question he'll be killed, right?

171
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:22,460
For the first time, he's about to
fight for someone other than himself,

172
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,830
as he lays down his own life!

173
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:53,820
You're still so weak!

174
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,740
Should I turn you into choco and eat'cha?

175
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,990
Or maybe a cheese cracker?

176
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:05,670
In order to defeat you, I'm going to
make sure you can't restore yourself,

177
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,670
by blowing you to tiny bits!!

178
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,390
<i>Farewell! Bulma... Trunks... and you, Kakarrot!</i>

179
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,840
V-Vegeta!

180
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,350
Vegeta!!

181
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:19,070
<i>A warrior vanishes in a</i>
<i>distant, astonishing light.</i>

182
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:25,450
<i>His name, Vegeta, the proud Saiyan prince.</i>

183
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,590
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

184
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,180
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

185
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:55,730
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

186
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,860
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

187
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:08,830
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

188
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:14,210
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

189
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,090
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

190
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:27,180
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

191
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,720
<i>Even now?</i>

192
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:36,360
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

193
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,740
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

194
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:48,240
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

195
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:58,250
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

196
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:15,690
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

197
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,650
<i>After Vegeta went and gave his</i>
<i>life to blow Majin Boo to pieces,</i>

198
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,740
<i>it still doesn't look like it's over.</i>
<i>Just what is about to happen?</i>

199
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,740
<i>Impossible! The fragments of</i>
<i>Majin Boo have started moving!</i>

200
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,040
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

201
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,410
<i>"The Nightmare Revisited!!</i>
<i>Majin Boo Has Survived."</i>

202
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:36,370
<i>Guys, it's too dangerous on earth anymore!</i>

203
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,380
"Next time"
"The Nightmare Revisited!!
Majin Boo Has Survived"
