<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,940
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,690
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,240
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:52,120
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:04,640
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,100
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,230
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,610
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12

<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,120
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,960
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,710
"Conk!"

17
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:16,230
Now then, let's hurry and
get the Cell Games started!

18
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,600
Who will go first?

19
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,360
As expected, will you, Son Goku, lead off?

20
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,160
Yeah, that's right.

21
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,750
<i>Son Goku is about to take the stage.</i>

22
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,880
<i>The battle, with the destiny of</i>
<i>the Earth hanging in the balance,</i>

23
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,340
<i>is now about to begin!</i>

24
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,850
<i>"Fight Time, Goku!!</i>
<i>The Ultra-Tense Cell Games."</i>

25
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,650
Th-The hope of all mankind,
Contestant Satan, has lost!

26
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,820
Could this mean the end of the Earth...?

27
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,780
It's finally time, huh?

28
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,410
Yeah.

29
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,970
<i>Come on, let's see it, Kakarrot!</i>

30
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,780
It's you, right off the bat, huh?

31
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,880
I was hoping to save the
most enjoyable for last, after all...

32
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,210
I hear you can use all of our techniques.

33
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,880
More or less.

34
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,270
Oh? Mister Satan!

35
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,230
Um, how did you come to lose?

36
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,860
I-I just missed my footing a little, that's all.

37
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,240
Huh? Your... footing?

38
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,870
That's right!

39
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,710
Um, it looked as though you were sent flying...

40
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,920
This is why it's so
awkward having laymen around.

41
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,920
When a master of Satan-<i>sama</i>'s
stature misses his footing,

42
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,720
this is the sort of severe thing that happens.

43
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,890
I-Is that right?

44
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,800
That's right!

45
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,560
But there's no need to worry!

46
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,610
After a short breather, I'll go
at him again like I really mean it!

47
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,990
Just leave it to me!

48
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,080
H-He still doesn't realize
the difference in their levels?!

49
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,500
He's the world champion of stupidity!

50
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,100
<i>The puzzle as to why Goku-san</i>

51
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,720
<i>is so unusually composed is about to be solved.</i>

52
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,280
People of the world, rest at ease!

53
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,790
Mister Satan may have inadvertently slipped

54
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,830
and landed out of the ring earlier,

55
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,790
but after a short break,
he will fight Cell once again!

56
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,000
While Contestant Satan is resting,

57
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,170
one of the people from that nonsensical group,

58
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:57,800
which utterly refuses to listen to our warnings,

59
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,180
apparently means to fight!

60
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:07,680
Let's leave them alone, already.
Once a fool, always a fool, after all.

61
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,850
What do you think, Mister Satan,

62
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,730
upon looking at this unknown warrior?

63
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,490
Utterly hopeless. Just by looking at his stance

64
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,860
and his build, you can tell he's a rank amateur.

65
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,240
Goku's incredible, huh?

66
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,870
Y-Yeah... He's left nothing unguarded.

67
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,710
That's not all.

68
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,880
Even now, as he's standing in front of Cell,

69
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,130
he's still standing naturally.

70
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,260
If anything, he's just
looking forward to this.

71
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,720
Which means that Goku-<i>san</i>
has his Super Saiyan state

72
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,390
completely under control, right?

73
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,790
Well now, if I were up there against that man,

74
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,710
I'd beat him in just two seconds.

75
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,090
The only thing I can think of
is that he's completely crazy.

76
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,590
He probably won't even
last five seconds against Cell.

77
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,470
Good grief, this won't
be much of a break at all!

78
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,600
He really is a troublesome fellow, huh?

79
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,150
Yeah, well, without some
entertainment such as this,

80
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,610
my own match wouldn't
be as stimulating, would it?

81
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,780
Come.

82
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,170
Up to now, it's been dead even.

83
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,380
But then,

84
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,840
neither one of them has even
started breathing harder yet, right?

85
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,850
Th-The fight that this
unnamed warrior just put up...

86
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,400
it wasn't, by any chance, incredible, was it?

87
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,690
How about it, Satan-<i>san</i>?

88
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,740
Um, Satan-<i>san</i>...?

89
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,040
Regarding that fight...?

90
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,870
Well, it wasn't bad, I suppose.

91
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,580
He's capable of more than I thought,

92
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,960
but he's overexerting himself considerably,
and he's probably reached his limit.

93
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,900
H-He's out of bounds!

94
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,850
Did he get him?!

95
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,910
How was that?

96
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,200
Were you able to experience
the sensation of victory somewhat?

97
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,670
Don't make your ruse so transparent.

98
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,840
We know that there's no way
you're going to be done in by just that.

99
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,680
You weren't showing off very much
of what you've got up your sleeve,

100
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,510
so I thought I'd try teasing you a little.

101
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,310
You didn't show very much off yourself, huh?

102
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:04,110
I'm going to start showing
you now, little by little–

103
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,650
the true difference
between our two powers, that is.

104
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,360
I look forward to it!

105
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,200
You appear to enjoy fighting, huh, Son Goku?

106
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,200
Just as one would expect
of a battle maniac Saiyan.

107
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,880
The same appears to be true of you.

108
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,880
In my case, it depends on the opponent.

109
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,590
Same with me.

110
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,890
They've vanished again.

111
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:07,270
What in the world has happened?
Both of them have vanished.

112
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,810
Mmm... It's a trick that
makes use of an optical illusion.

113
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,900
The two of them are camouflaging themselves,

114
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,820
and are lying down on the floor.

115
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
Is that right?

116
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,290
There's no way that Mister Satan,

117
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,790
whose kinetic eyesight is sharp
enough to see the seams on a fastball,

118
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,170
could be mistaken.

119
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,510
But still... I don't understand this at all.

120
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,840
Um, Mister Sata–huh?!

121
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,680
Satan-<i>san</i>? Uh, Satan-<i>san</i>? Satan-<i>san</i>?!

122
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,560
Where did you go?! Satan-<i>san</i>?!

123
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,650
This is startling!

124
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,650
Mister Satan has also disappeared!

125
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,280
Mister Satan was right here!

126
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,540
Well, as you can see, even I can
easily perform a trick such as this.

127
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,870
Wow, I didn't notice it in the slightest!

128
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,840
Where did he bring that piece of cloth from?

129
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,720
I heard he spent last night making it secretly.

130
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,310
Watching those guys is funny!

131
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,850
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

132
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:27,680
S-Sorry.

133
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,310
S-Still and all, what speed!

134
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,560
I can barely keep up
with them with my eyes!

135
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,910
<i>They're surprised at this level? What a laugh!</i>

136
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,440
There's some sort of
commotion going on over there.

137
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,610
The kids over there must
be playing on their own.

138
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,930
Here they come!

139
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,770
They've appeared!

140
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,400
There, you see?
They were hiding there, all right!

141
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,580
This is that incredible power–

142
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,830
the moment I felt this,
I got flipped up into the air!

143
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:16,670
M-Me too. What could this
overwhelming sort of power be?

144
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,670
They're using nothing but petty tricks!

145
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,010
What do they think the martial arts are?!

146
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,850
This is bad!

147
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,690
There's nowhere to go!

148
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,270
Cell has gone completely on the offensive!

149
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,020
Why?

150
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,030
Why doesn't Father get serious?

151
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,370
<i>Hmph, I knew it. Kakarrot is</i>
<i>just playing around with Cell.</i>

152
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:58,080
<i>Although, Cell seems to</i>
<i>be up to the same thing.</i>

153
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,190
That's an old trick, huh?

154
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,960
<i>Ka... me...</i>

155
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,420
<i>ha... me...</i>

156
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,760
<i>Ha</i>!!

157
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:24,590
So then, that should be enough
for the warm-up exercises, right?

158
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,960
Yeah.

159
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,600
Th-That was just warm-up exercise...?

160
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,760
Th-The full-fledged death
battle is about to get started now...!

161
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,950
<i>Son Goku, huh...?</i>
<i>Indeed, he is skilled at fighting.</i>

162
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,700
<i>He's one or two paces removed from the others.</i>

163
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,170
<i>This guy looks to be unimaginably strong.</i>

164
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,630
<i>If I get even the slightest bit careless,</i>

165
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,130
I'll be finished off in an instant!

166
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,650
All right....!

167
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,360
<i>The look in Goku-san's eyes has changed!</i>

168
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,740
<i>He's coming at me at full power.</i>

169
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,350
<i>At last, Goku will fight at full power!</i>

170
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,740
<i>With his full-blown strength...</i>

171
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,870
<i>there is no doubt that</i>
<i>this will be a fierce battle.</i>

172
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:21,740
<i>Which way will the victory go?</i>

173
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,190
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

174
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,030
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

175
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,410
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

176
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,870
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

177
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,380
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

178
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:16,510
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

179
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:20,010
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

180
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,640
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

181
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:30,150
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

183
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,070
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

184
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,070
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

185
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,750
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

186
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,920
<i>So sorry.</i>

187
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,040
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

188
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,090
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

189
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,940
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

190
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,240
<i>Stop, Cell! If you launch a</i>
<i>Kamehame-Ha with that much power,</i>

191
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,240
<i>you're putting the earth at risk!</i>

192
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,080
<i>Do you really think that concerns me?</i>

193
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,250
<i>Take this!</i>

194
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,370
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

195
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,880
<i>"Direct Hit to Earth!!</i>
<i>Cell's Extra-Large Kamehame-Ha."</i>

196
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,960
<i>Look out! Father, you won't</i>
<i>be able to get clear of that!</i>

197
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,920
"Next time"
"Direct Hit to Earth!!
Cell's Extra-Large Kamehame-Ha"
