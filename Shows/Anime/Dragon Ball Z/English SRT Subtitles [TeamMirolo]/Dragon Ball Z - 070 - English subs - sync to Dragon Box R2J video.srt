22
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:33,285

00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:30,045
140,000!

28
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:42,255
In all the universe, <i>I</i> should be the one

29
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:54,295
150,000! How can this be?!

30
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:01,075
Stop it!

31
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,425
Why you!

32
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:02,225
180,000?!

33
00:05:02,265 --> 00:05:09,235
I-I can't believe it! This is your true power?!

34
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,675
N-No wonder we didn't
stand a chance against him!

35
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:16,275
How can a Saiyan be so strong?

36
00:05:16,315 --> 00:05:17,815
And just so we're clear,

37
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:22,645
I can momentarily put out
much more power than even this!

38
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:24,525
What?!

39
00:05:35,705 --> 00:05:37,395
You can't possibly...

40
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,645
You can't possibly be...

41
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:35,785
How awful! I want to get
away from this planet soon!

42
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:49,045
The Dragon Balls can grant any wish...

43
00:07:11,635 --> 00:07:15,365
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>, it's Nail<i>-san</i>!

44
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:18,135
I know.

45
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:35,145
Why have you returned?

46
00:07:35,185 --> 00:07:41,055
Have I not charged you with the
task of assisting the people from Earth?

47
00:07:41,095 --> 00:07:42,625
My sincerest apologies.

48
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:47,625
However, it is my duty, above all others,
to defend your life, Grand Elder<i>-sama.</i>

49
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:49,125
Even so...

50
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:53,565
If you die, Grand Elder<i>-sama,</i>
the Dragon Balls will also disappear.

51
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:58,375
If that happens, then the
Earthlings' wish cannot be granted.

52
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:06,455
Very well.

53
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,595
It's just over there, Kuririn<i>-san.</i>

54
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:22,155
Okay. Hurry!

55
00:08:29,045 --> 00:08:30,605
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

56
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,545
We're here for the Dragon Radar!

57
00:08:45,095 --> 00:08:47,215
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

58
00:08:52,995 --> 00:08:57,165
Bulma<i>-san</i>! Please come out
from wherever you're hiding!

59
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:14,315
Good grief. And us without a moment to lose.

60
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:17,985
She's never around when
it's really important, huh?

61
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,115
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, look!

62
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:26,565
Jet-Bike tracks!

63
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:31,735
Where do you suppose Bulma<i>-san</i>
would have gone on a Jet-Bike?

64
00:09:31,775 --> 00:09:33,095
You don't suppose

65
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:37,575
she's decided to go off touring
Namek or something at a time like this?

66
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:40,005
Touring?

67
00:09:40,045 --> 00:09:41,845
We'll follow her!

68
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:45,085
We have to get the Radar from her and locate
the Dragon Balls before we run out of time!

69
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,115
Right!

70
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:14,615
There it is.

71
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:21,085
Sure enough, it appears that
he finally sniffed this place out.

72
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,555
He's almost here.

73
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:24,955
Dende, come here.

74
00:10:24,995 --> 00:10:26,515
Right.

75
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:57,915
Go to them, Dende.

76
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:01,485
The Earthlings stand in need of you.

77
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:03,925
I've drawn out the power within you,

78
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:06,925
so you should be able to
arrive in a short amount of time.

79
00:11:06,965 --> 00:11:07,925
B-But...

80
00:11:07,965 --> 00:11:10,335
Go now.

81
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:17,735
Very well. Grand Elder<i>-sama,</i>
please don't die on us!

82
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:40,395
I wonder, will I be killed, or
will my time to pass on come first?

83
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:57,745
Y-You can't possibly be a...

84
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:02,085
...Super Saiyan, can you?!

85
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:07,225
You know, Vegeta said
the same kind of thing earlier.

86
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:10,825
But I have no idea what
you guys are talking about.

87
00:12:10,865 --> 00:12:15,805
A Super Saiyan! A legendary
warrior stronger than any other!

88
00:12:17,305 --> 00:12:19,835
How can this be?!

89
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,835
H-He's a... He's a...

90
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:29,575
...Super Saiyan, the only
thing Freeza<i>-sama</i> is afraid of?!

91
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:34,185
Sorry, but there ain't any
way that you can beat me.

92
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:37,285
I don't want to fight a meaningless battle.

93
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,625
You guys get off this planet.

94
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:52,035
W-What? Do you really mean that?

95
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:56,205
I really mean it. Especially you.
You're a much fairer warrior than I thought.

96
00:12:56,245 --> 00:12:57,875
I don't want to kill you.

97
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:59,775
You don't want to kill me?

98
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:07,015
<i>You don't want to fight meaningless battles?</i>

99
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:20,065
Get off this planet?

100
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,965
A Super Saiyan is supposed to be

101
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:27,065
the strongest warrior in
the universe, who loves to fight.

102
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,635
S-So then,

103
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,115
you're <i>not</i> a Super Saiyan, are you?

104
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:37,845
You have not completely become a Super Saiyan.

105
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:41,985
I see... You are not a Super Saiyan after all.

106
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:46,355
Is that right?

107
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:06,335
I see. So that is where the Namekians are.

108
00:14:31,375 --> 00:14:35,935
Oh, very well. I suppose I can
leave such a speck of dust alone.

109
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:47,745
He is here.

110
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:28,025
What do you want?

111
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,255
My name is Freeza,

112
00:15:30,295 --> 00:15:35,425
and I have a wish that I would like
to have granted with the Dragon Balls.

113
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:37,965
I have managed to gather
all seven Dragon Balls together,

114
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:41,775
but for whatever reason,
I cannot seem to get my wish granted.

115
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:46,535
And so I was hoping you could tell me,

116
00:15:46,575 --> 00:15:50,575
how does one get their wish granted?

117
00:15:50,615 --> 00:15:56,615
I must ask you to leave.
I cannot tell that to anyone who is evil.

118
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:19,175
Well, well, you still have
some friends around, do you?

119
00:16:19,215 --> 00:16:22,575
They must have fairly low battle powers.

120
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:26,145
My Scouter did not pick
them up until just now, after all.

121
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:29,785
Those guys!

122
00:16:46,535 --> 00:16:48,105
Looks like we're in time.

123
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,505
Yeah.

124
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:53,705
S-Stop! Don't do it! You
don't have a chance against him!

125
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:57,805
Maybe we don't have a chance,
but we can still land a punch or two!

126
00:16:59,555 --> 00:17:04,115
After all, we're warrior-types
too, just like you are.

127
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:05,885
Warrior-types?

128
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,535
Oh, all three of you have
battle powers of around 10,000.

129
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:24,575
I suppose I should expect as
much from warriors of this planet.

130
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:27,605
As far as I am concerned, however,
you are still like rubbish to me.

131
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:31,075
What did you call us?!

132
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,685
Stop it! Your deaths will be meaningless!

133
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:42,355
Nail, you take care of Grand Elder<i>-sama.</i>

134
00:17:44,735 --> 00:17:47,925
<i>My children...</i>

135
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:36,345
Do you know the password for the Dragon Balls?

136
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,025
Well?

137
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:55,255
No, I suppose that rubbish
like you would not know.

138
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,165
It was silly of me to have even asked.

139
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,255
I think it would be best
for you to accommodate me.

140
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:27,095
There is no reason why I should not kill you.

141
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:29,165
There are two of you here, are there not?

142
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:32,995
Either one of you would be
acceptable in answering my request.

143
00:19:33,035 --> 00:19:38,335
You can do as you wish. But
before we fight, I will say this much:

144
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,875
The other one, who resides within this house,

145
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:44,115
is the Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> of Planet Namek.

146
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:49,115
The Dragon Balls are the
creation of this Grand Elder<i>-sama.</i>

147
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:52,615
Listen well, and get this
through that head of yours!

148
00:19:52,655 --> 00:19:56,855
If you kill Grand Elder<i>-sama,</i>
the Dragon Balls will also disappear!

149
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:01,365
Grand Elder?

150
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:35,195
Now I see. Apparently,
you are telling the truth.

151
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:41,105
He is certainly different
from the other Namekians.

152
00:20:41,145 --> 00:20:44,105
Grand Elder<i>-san</i>, I do not suppose that you

153
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:48,075
would be of a mind to tell me, would you?

154
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:50,515
However,

155
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:53,075
you would not refuse to
tell me if this gentleman here

156
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:55,845
were about to be killed, would you?

157
00:20:55,885 --> 00:21:00,855
Nail will not be as easy
to defeat as you may think.

158
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:06,095
He is the strongest of
the warrior-type Namekians.

159
00:21:06,135 --> 00:21:08,565
You will not be able to do to him

160
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:13,505
as you have the other
Namekians you have killed up to now.

161
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:21,545
It appears you have no intention
of telling me, no matter what, do you?

162
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:26,775
I'm counting on you, Nail.
Buy us as much time as you can.

163
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:28,445
Understood.

164
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,885
Very well. If you are
going to be as stubborn as this,

165
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:40,495
then I will show you the terror of
the strongest being in the universe.

166
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:01,415
You are not a Super Saiyan.

167
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:07,455
But you are at least far stronger than I am.

168
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:13,695
Such incredible strength!

169
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:20,095
<i>Freeza's evil grasp closes</i>
<i>around the Grand Elder and Nail.</i>

170
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:24,205
<i>Will they be able to keep the</i>
<i>secret of the Dragon Balls safe?</i>

171
00:22:24,245 --> 00:22:29,235
<i>And what will be the outcome of</i>
<i>the fight between Goku and Ginyu?</i>

172
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:48,695
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

173
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:54,535
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

174
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,905
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

175
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

176
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:11,915
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

177
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:16,025
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

178
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:19,525
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

179
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,165
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

180
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,775
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

182
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,575
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

183
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

184
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

185
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

186
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,595
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

187
00:23:55,335 --> 00:24:00,605
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

188
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:13,975
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

189
00:24:14,015 --> 00:24:18,785
<i>I-I can't move... W-What am I doing over there?!</i>

190
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,785
<i>I've made an exchange.</i>

191
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:25,295
<i>Your body, with its tremendous</i>
<i>hidden power, for my body.</i>

192
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:27,255
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

193
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:30,865
<i>"Surprise!! Goku is Ginyu</i>

194
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:34,845
<i>Father, Mother is going to</i>
