00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,890
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,230

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:52,080

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:04,590

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,950
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,910
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,370
<i>At last, Cell had become</i>
<i>his ultimate, perfect form.</i>

17
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,040
Miserable Vegeta! Take responsibility!

18
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,720
I knew it. Even if it is his perfect form,
it doesn't appear to be anything special.

19
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,560
Damn it all!

20
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,390
How dare you take No. 18?!

21
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,610
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

22
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,830
Don't you move, Cell!

23
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,410
<i>Kienzan</i>!!

24
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,010
Kuririn-<i>san</i>! Please, get away!

25
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,770
<i>The first casualty is Kuririn.</i>

26
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,690
<i>The overture to the collapse of the Earth–no,</i>
<i>the whole universe–has already begun!</i>

27
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:25,330
<i>"Super Vegeta in Peril!!</i>
<i>An Absolutely Perfect Terror Closes In!!"</i>

28
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:37,880
K-Kuririn-<i>san...</i>

29
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,970
H-He's too awful!

30
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,390
T-This is a first.

31
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,720
There wasn't even time to feel pain.

32
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,740
I-I'm still falling to pieces.

33
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:49,250
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

34
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,930
Such a fortunate man,

35
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:03,390
to be the first to taste of this perfect power.

36
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,390
Stay with us, Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

37
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,400
Here's a senzu. Can you eat it?

38
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,990
Please, swallow it somehow.

39
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,650
Did it make you happy to pick on that scum?

40
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,910
Just as I thought, it would
appear that even in this perfect form,

41
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,420
you're nothing special.

42
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,000
You'll have to excuse me.

43
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,630
Now then, would you assist me in warming up?

44
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,350
Very good. I will finish you off as you warm up.

45
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,890
If you please...

46
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,750
Thank goodness! Kuririn-<i>san...</i>

47
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,970
That was a close call!

48
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,010
I thought you might have had it.

49
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,470
Kuririn-<i>san</i>?

50
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,020
This isn't good! Vegeta's going to get killed!

51
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,820
I'm certainly not much at all
when compared to you Saiyans.

52
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:24,990
However, I more-or-less know
the strength of this opponent.

53
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,030
I-I know... I know how terrible he is!

54
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,040
To him, he probably
did no more than tap me,

55
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,870
but I learned how terrible he is!

56
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,620
C-Cell has truly gotten stronger.

57
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,830
However, Vegeta still
exceeds him in every way.

58
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,970
Y-You can't take the <i>ki</i> you
can feel now as a reference.

59
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,140
He's hiding a much, much
more phenomenal power!

60
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,930
Just like you are, Trunks.

61
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,430
You knew?

62
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,820
It seems the power-up from
this perfect form of yours...

63
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,820
...was not altogether
an exaggeration after all.

64
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,260
Vegeta is that sort of guy,
so maybe he didn't realize it,

65
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,600
but somehow, I could tell.

66
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,940
You've been sort of... reserved toward Vegeta.

67
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,360
You've overcome the wall
that Vegeta could not overcome.

68
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,650
Am I wrong?

69
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,190
What's the matter? Is this all
the power of your perfect form?

70
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,900
Dad has gone beyond
the limits of Super Saiyan.

71
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,930
It would appear that you have
become able to fight a bit more decently.

72
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,980
But you're still a long way
from being a match for me.

73
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,560
Sure enough, this is the
power-up you would have gotten

74
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,440
from absorbing those
flea-market Artificial Humans.

75
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,610
Maybe so.

76
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,610
Smile, will you?

77
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,460
He achieved outstanding power,
such as the strength he has now.

78
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,340
However, one day,
I went beyond even that world.

79
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,010
I realized that this must have
been what Goku-<i>san</i> was speaking of.

80
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,930
I couldn't tell Dad about it!

81
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,930
I couldn't tell Dad, not
with his towering pride!

82
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,640
Trunks...

83
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,310
Dad should have defeated Cell as he was!

84
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,970
Vegeta is sure impressive.

85
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,430
He's fighting toe-to-toe
with the perfect form Cell.

86
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,640
Toe-to-toe, you say?

87
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,140
Vegeta is getting frantic.

88
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:52,150
With someone of equal–no, perhaps
even greater ability before his eyes,

89
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,980
his rational judgment has dropped.

90
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,400
Hey, there!

91
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,410
How long are you two going to
be enjoying this all by yourselves?

92
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,620
You let me know just
what's going on as well!

93
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,280
I mean, really...!

94
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,000
Nice going, Gohan.

95
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,640
That's it! You've just
about got your <i>ki</i> under control!

96
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,350
This is smarting just as I expected.

97
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:32,390
At this pace, you'll soon surpass me!

98
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,110
Mock me, will you?

99
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,600
You can't get away!

100
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,590
Just as I expected, Vegeta.

101
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,260
That attack just now was pretty good.

102
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,610
Don't you make light of me!

103
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,620
Take this!!

104
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,940
Dad...

105
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,650
Vegeta there has lost his composure.

106
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,530
To think that by absorbing No. 17 and No. 18,

107
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,570
Cell's power would rise this much...!

108
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,420
Dammit!

109
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,200
Dammit!

110
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,600
What sort of monster has
Doctor Gero given rise to?

111
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,120
D-Don't you toy with me!

112
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,810
D-Dad...

113
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,440
You mean there's that much
difference between their powers?

114
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,320
You miserable jackass!

115
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:44,460
You're not taking this seriously, are you?!

116
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,960
I did say this would just
be warming up, didn't I?

117
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,960
What?!

118
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,670
H-He's saying everything up
to now was just warming up?

119
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,270
Fight like you mean it!

120
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,310
After that catastrophic beating
from me, you must be angry, right Cell?

121
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,520
You've become your perfect form,
but nothing has changed in the least.

122
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,690
You're just the same as you were
when you were getting beaten up!

123
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,530
If that bothers you,

124
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,290
then show me the power
of this perfect form of yours!

125
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,200
Well, maybe just a little bit.

126
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,800
When I have become
Super Vegeta, do not mock me!!

127
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,680
H-He connected!

128
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,520
W-What?

129
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,540
Super Vegeta, huh?

130
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,380
That should have connected...!

131
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,600
Vegeta's kick had to have connected
perfectly with Cell's vital point!

132
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,060
And yet, there's been no damage at all!

133
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,600
He really is a monster!

134
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,940
Trunks, aren't you going to help,
with that hidden power of yours?

135
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,530
Dad...

136
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,200
Dad would look upon being
helped by myself or Goku-<i>san</i>

137
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,990
to be much more humiliating
than being defeated by Cell.

138
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,290
That's just the kind of person Dad is.

139
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,330
B-But still...!

140
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,600
He'll be beaten! Vegeta will be beaten!

141
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,610
<i>Before the perfect form of Cell, the</i>
<i>power of Super Vegeta is of no avail.</i>

142
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,610
<i>What will you do, Vegeta?</i>

143
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,310
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

144
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:54,110
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

145
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,480
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

146
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,990
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

147
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:11,500
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

148
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,630
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

149
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,130
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

150
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:21,760
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

151
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:29,260
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

152
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,350
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

153
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,190
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

154
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:39,190
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

155
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,910
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

156
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,030
