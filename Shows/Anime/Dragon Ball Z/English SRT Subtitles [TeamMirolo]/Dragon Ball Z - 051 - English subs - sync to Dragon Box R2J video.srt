00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:03,570
<i>On his way to Planet Namek, Son Goku</i>
<i>had fallen into some unexpected trouble.</i>

17
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,650

18
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,390
<i>and he was able to safely escape the danger.</i>

19
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,260
<i>At that same time, on Planet Namek,</i>
<i>Vegeta, who had just defeated Dodoria,</i>

20
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,040
<i>had done an end run around Freeza, setting</i>
<i>out to search for the Dragon Balls himself.</i>

21
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:51,420
<i>"Courage Times One Hundred!</i>
<i>The Warriors Gathered Under Kaio."</i>

22
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,890
Oh, is that so? So that's what happened, huh?

23
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,700
Mm-hmm. I really thought we were done for.

24
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,220
You should eat something. It may not
be that good, but feel free to help yourself.

25
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,590
What was that?

26
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:37,690
You're complaining about the food
that I made, after all you've eaten?!

27
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,790
Eh?!

28
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,630
N-No, I-I would never–!

29
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,570
I meant that it may not be
that good, but it's still delicious.

30
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,550
I don't blame him. Just about everyone
from his village has been killed, right?

31
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,550
Oh, right. This isn't the
right time for a meal, huh?

32
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,860
We don't eat things like this.
We just need to drink water.

33
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,730
No way! There were fields at your village

34
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,200
where you were raising
vegetables or something, weren't there?

35
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,730
Those were Ajissa seedlings.

36
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,170
Ajissa seedlings?

37
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,740
Yes. Long ago, before the
abnormal weather occurred,

38
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:28,720
Namek was said to be a
beautiful world, rich with Ajissa trees.

39
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,710
However...

40
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,120
The Ajissa forests and
most of the Namekians died out.

41
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,770
So now, we're trying to make Namek
beautiful again by growing more Ajissa trees.

42
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,570
And after we'd finally
raised some Ajissa seedlings...

43
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,960
We got him!

44
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,870
Why, you–!

45
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,930
Say, what is your name?

46
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:08,270
Dende. Uh, who exactly are you people?

47
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,880
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, is that–?

48
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,520
What's gotten into you all of
a sudden? Is someone else coming?

49
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,660
N-No, it's not that.

50
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,510
The <i>ki</i> are dropping, one after another.

51
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:47,140
T-The Namekians are being killed once again.

52
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,880
T-The one killing them is
someone we know very well! It's Vegeta!

53
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,450
He's attacking a different village!

54
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:01,060
W-What a horrible bunch these guys are!

55
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,890
V-Vegeta has acquired the
technique for sensing <i>ki</i>, all right.

56
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,960
This is going to be trouble.

57
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,470
Now we'll have to be wary about
moving around until Goku gets here.

58
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:16,510
I'm not sure whether Vegeta and that
Freeza bastard are on the same side or not,

59
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,640
but if either one of them gains
eternal life with the Dragon Balls,

60
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,940
it will be the end of the world.

61
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,250
If we are able to find and
hide even one of the Dragon Balls,

62
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,490
they won't be able to get all seven together.

63
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,490
W-We can't! If we were to do that,

64
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:37,930
then they would keep searching
until they had killed all of the Namekians!

65
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,030
O-Oh, no...

66
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:47,500
It's appalling, no matter
which way it turns out.

67
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,440
A-And even once Goku gets here,
there's no guarantee that he can beat them.

68
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,040
Damn!

69
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,060
If only I had finished Vegeta off back then!

70
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,890
Please tell me about yourselves.

71
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,460
W-Where have you come from?
How do you know about the Dragon Balls?

72
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:18,500
P-Please save everyone else on the planet!

73
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:35,080
W-Why, you–! How could you do this?!

74
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,570
No matter what happens, you have no intention
of handing over the Dragon Ball, do you?

75
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,770
I-I'm not about to hand
it over to the likes of you!

76
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,930
You are one interminably stubborn old geezer.

77
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,970
Well, fine, suit yourself.
I'll look for it myself.

78
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,250
Wait!

79
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,670
You are getting on my nerves.

80
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,110
Here I thought it was going to be hidden,
but there it is, on regal display.

81
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,280
Now then, for this thing...

82
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,470
If I submerge the Dragon Ball here,
no one will be able to find it.

83
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,270
I'm the only one who knows about it.

84
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,110
Freeza and his men have
five of the Dragon Balls.

85
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:11,480
I guess I'll search for the last one.

86
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:43,210
Dodoria is taking far too much time, isn't he?

87
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,650
Could he still be chasing
after those odd pipsqueaks?

88
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:52,150
Never mind him. If that fool cannot
catch those kids, then let him be.

89
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,160
More importantly, go and search
for the remaining two Dragon Balls.

90
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,830
Yes, sir, understood.

91
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:02,130
If we search the remaining villages,
they are sure to have the Dragon Balls.

92
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,130
With the two of us searching, we
should be able to find a village, at least.

93
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:12,080
Well, I will take these five Dragon Balls
and wait for you at the spaceship.

94
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,980
I am counting on you.

95
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,980
With just two more of them, I will be
able to have my wish granted, after all.

96
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,580
Yes, sir.

97
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:31,030
You search over there. If you find
a village, do nothing, and come inform me.

98
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,030
If there are any strong Namekians there,
they would probably be too much for you.

99
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:36,200
Yes, sir.

100
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,600
For now, we will meet back
at the spaceship in three hours.

101
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,940
Yes, sir!

102
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,510
It is possible that Vegeta may have
already found the remaining pair.

103
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,520
And if he has, he ought to be
coming for our Dragon Balls.

104
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,090
As such, he may be saving me
the trouble of searching for them.

105
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,930
When Vegeta comes to get ours,
I will kill him, and take his two from him.

106
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,800
Then I will have all seven of them.

107
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:15,100
Is that how I am to be
endowed with eternal life?

108
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,110
Now then, to wait leisurely at the spaceship.

109
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,570
Right, this Kami<i>-sama</i> person was a
Namekian who had made his way to Earth.

110
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:50,510
We want to use the Dragon Balls
here to bring our dead friends back to life.

111
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,510
If things go right when our wish is granted,

112
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,940
the Dragon Balls on
Earth will be revived as well.

113
00:14:54,980 --> 00:15:02,520
S-So that's why you're here, is it?
I've finally unraveled the mystery about you.

114
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,450
I'm begging you, please come with me!

115
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,290
I will show you where the Grand Elder is!

116
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,090
Grand Elder?

117
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,100
Who is this Grand Elder?

118
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,930
The one who gave birth
to all of us here on Namek.

119
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,500
The only one who survived
the abnormal weather long ago,

120
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,470
and once again brought life to Namek.

121
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,550
I am Grand Elder's 108th child.

122
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,980
The only one? How do you guys have children?

123
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,990
How, you ask? We spawn
eggs out though our mouths.

124
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,060
O-Oh, yeah? T-That's unusual, huh?

125
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,000
Then, this Grand Elder person is a woman, right?

126
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,170
Woman? What's a woman?

127
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,870
W-What's a woman? There are two
kinds of Namekians, right? Male and female.

128
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,050
Let's see... f-for example,
you have a father and a mother...

129
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:10,520
Huh? Two kinds? W-Well, um...

130
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,920
Did you hear that? They don't have
male and female. What a dull planet, huh?

131
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,700
Thank goodness I'm not a Namekian.

132
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,530
N-Never mind that, tell me why
we're going to this Grand Elder.

133
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:31,540
T-The ones who attacked our
village already had four Dragon Balls.

134
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,610
A-And you just said

135
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:38,450
there were a lot of people
being killed in that direction, right?

136
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
Y-Yeah, probably by someone named Vegeta.

137
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,090
T-There isn't a single <i>ki</i> left anymore.

138
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:49,890
They were probably all wiped out.

139
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,060
If that's the case, then there are
hardly any Namekians left on this world.

140
00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,070
I see. Assuming that Vegeta found the
Dragon Ball from the village he attacked,

141
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,070
then there's only one left.

142
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,080
By any chance, does the Grand
Elder have that last Dragon Ball?

143
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,080
Y-Yes.

144
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,910
Oh, no!

145
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,580
Those Freeza guys may have lost their Scouters,

146
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,880
but Vegeta has gained the ability to sense <i>ki.</i>

147
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,460
If he searches for <i>ki</i>, he'll arrive at
the Grand Elder's place before long,

148
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,890
and he'll take the seventh Dragon Ball from him!

149
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,060
T-Then we have to hurry and
go tell the Grand Elder about this!

150
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,500
Please! Please!

151
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,240
Whether it's Freeza or Vegeta,

152
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,110
if either one of them is given
eternal life, it will be terrible!

153
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,510
A-All right, let's hurry. Show me the way.

154
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,110
Right.

155
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,910
I'll go with Dende to meet the Grand Elder.

156
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,290
Gohan and Bulma<i>-san</i>, you wait here for us.

157
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,850
It won't do any good
for all of us to go, right?

158
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,130
U-Understood. Be careful.

159
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,430
Remember, you be careful, too!

160
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,800
Right!

161
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:19,880
<i>Vegeta seems to be even</i>
<i>stronger than he was before,</i>

162
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,890
<i>and I sensed an even more</i>
<i>incredible ki from that Freeza guy.</i>

163
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,320
<i>I don't know what kind</i>
<i>of training Goku is doing,</i>

164
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,890
<i>but this time, even he</i>
<i>might not be up to the task.</i>

165
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,490
<i>In any case, we'll get the one</i>
<i>Dragon Ball the Grand Elder has,</i>

166
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,900
<i>and then just hide for five</i>
<i>and a half days until Goku arrives.</i>

167
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,070
<i>After that, all we can do is wait</i>
<i>for Goku to perform a miracle.</i>

168
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,310
<i>Ah, if I'm starting to hope</i>
<i>for miracles, then we've had it.</i>

169
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,210
<i>Geez, I've never had a</i>
<i>single woman in my life, either.</i>

170
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:33,890
All right... terrific... I'm pretty
used to this twenty-times gravity now...

171
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,460
Okay, maybe I should try thirty-times now.

172
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,060
Goku! Can you hear me? Goku! Huh?

173
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,270
Oh! That voice! Is that you, Kaio<i>-sama</i>?!

174
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,240
Oh, indeed it is Kaio.

175
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,250
By any chance, is that outer space
you're in now? What are you doing in space?

176
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,420
Oh, I get it. Planet Namek, right?

177
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,420
It would be nice if you could
find their Dragon Balls, huh?

178
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,790
What's with you, Kaio<i>-sama</i>?!
Don't you know anything?

179
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:11,190
There's something terrible
happening on Planet Namek.

180
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,630
Something terrible?
Well, I'll ask about that later.

181
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,270
As it happens, I've had
some visitors come by here.

182
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,440
Visitors? What about them?

183
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,270
It's amazing.

184
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:32,280
These visitors cleared the Serpentine Road
and arrived in far less time than you did.

185
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,280
What's more, there are four of them.

186
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,450
<i>Huh?</i>

187
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,850
Four of them?

188
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:40,860
That's right. You know these four quite well.

189
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,330
Y-You don't mean–?

190
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:55,070
They all want even tougher
training than what you went through.

191
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,370
T-That's awesome!

192
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:04,350
You mean that each of them has arrived
there together at your place, Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

193
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,010
Can I talk to Goku?

194
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:10,420
Place your hand on my shoulder and speak.

195
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,820
Yo, do you hear me, Goku?

196
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,390
Yamucha!

197
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,730
We met the dead Kami<i>-sama</i>
here on the Other Side,

198
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:20,830
and he told us about this place.

199
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,200
Hey, we hear that you're
going off to Piccolo's homeworld

200
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,400
in search of the Dragon Balls there for us.

201
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,280
In order to bring us back to life.

202
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,380
He said there were four of you,
right? Yamucha and Tenshinhan...

203
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,410
By any chance, is Piccolo there, too?

204
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,850
Yeah, Piccolo is here.

205
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:46,250
Hmph. My pride won't allow for
only <i>you</i> getting stronger, after all.

206
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,860
Is the last one Kami<i>-sama</i>?

207
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,420
No, it's not.

208
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,260
Kami<i>-sama</i> stayed in the Next World.
It's Chaozu, if you can believe that.

209
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,430
Chaozu?! Chaozu got blown
to pieces. Is he still okay?

210
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:04,270
Yeah, Kami<i>-sama</i> apparently
regenerated his body, especially for him.

211
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:09,440
Wow, that's amazing! Good for you, Chaozu!

212
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,250
Awesome!

213
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,620
That's awesome! With everyone alongside,
my courage is a hundred times greater!

214
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,460
<i>What's this? Familiar faces</i>
<i>gathered together under Kaio-sama.</i>

215
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,800
<i>However, Goku is still unaware of the</i>
<i>atrocities taking place on Planet Namek.</i>

216
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,580
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

217
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,420
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

218
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,800
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

219
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

220
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,810
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

221
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,910
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

222
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

223
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,050
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

224
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,530
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

225
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,660
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

226
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,460
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

227
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,500
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

228
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:45,170
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

229
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,340
<i>So sorry.</i>

230
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,480
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

231
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,490
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

232
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,900
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

233
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,140
<i>Is Freeza really all that incredible?</i>

234
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,370
<i>I can't wait to meet him.</i>

235
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,710
<i>No! This time around, you are no match for him.</i>

236
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,910
<i>You must not make him angry.</i>
<i>This is an order from Kaio.</i>

237
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,680
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

238
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,850
<i>"Listen to Me, Goku! Hands Off Freeza."</i>

239
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,360
<i>I wonder if Piccolo-san can</i>
<i>make a pun in front of Kaio-sama.</i>

240
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,200
"Next time"
"Listen to Me, Goku!
Hands Off Freeza"
