<i>What was his objective?</i>

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,360
This is ridiculous! I-I was
shaking so much, I couldn't move!

22
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:14,640
<i>"The Mightiest Warrior in All of</i>
<i>History is Goku's Older Brother!"</i>

23
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,870
Have you lost sight
of your pride as a Saiyan,

24
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:23,780
the mightiest warriors
in the universe, Kakarrot?!

25
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,080
Kakarrot?!

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,960
Good afternoon!

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,960
It's been so long!

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

29
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,370
You said to come visit you, so I came.

30
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,900
Wow, it really has been a long time!

31
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,670
This house hasn't changed
at all in the meantime, huh?

32
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,740
You sure have been cold to us, huh?

33
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,680
Unless someone tells you to
come over, you never come, after all.

34
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,410
Here!

35
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,850
I brought some <i>manju</i> buns as a present.

36
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,350
You didn't need to go to that trouble.

37
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,390
If you'd just let me touch
your boobs a little bit, I'd–

38
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,760
You just don't appreciate
my gags, the same as always!

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,740
You're just a lecherous jerk,
the same as always!

40
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,350
By the way, Bulma<i>-san</i>, what's
happening with Yamucha<i>-san</i>?

41
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:38,350
Yamucha? That idiot?

42
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,890
How should I know about
that guy? I'm so mad at him,

43
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,920
I didn't tell him that everyone
was getting together here today!

44
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,360
Let's have ourselves a
blast without him being here!

45
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,700
You guys sure do fight a lot.

46
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,260
They sure do.

47
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,930
So then, where's Lunch<i>-san</i>?

48
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,740
She went out somewhere, chasing
after Tenshinhan<i>-san</i>, five years ago.

49
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,020
<i>The position of this power is</i>
<i>moving at considerable speed.</i>

50
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,980
There! That's Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>'s house!

51
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,960
Miserable Kakarrot!
You're not getting away from me!

52
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,830
Yoo-hoo!

53
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,340
It's stopped!

54
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,740
–Son<i>-kun</i>!
–Goku!

55
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,770
Huh? What's up with the boy?

56
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,180
Have you taken up a
job baby-sitting, Goku?

57
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,450
He's my boy!

58
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,050
Y-Yours, Goku?!

59
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,990
Yeah, that's right.

60
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,790
Go on, say hello.

61
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,260
Good afternoon.

62
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,830
–Yes, good afternoon.
–Yes, good afternoon.
–Yes, good afternoon.

63
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,300
His name is Son Gohan.

64
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:02,330
Son Gohan? So, you've given
him the name of your late grandpa?

65
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,770
Yeah.

66
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:06,140
Still, this is a surprise!

67
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,540
To think that Goku
would bring a child along!

68
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,240
Gohan<i>-kun</i>, how old might you be?

69
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,950
I'm four years old.

70
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,350
Wow. He's got good manners,
considering he's your boy, Son<i>-kun.</i>

71
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,860
Chichi is fussy about that.

72
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,660
Say, Gohan<i>-kun</i>, what are you
going to be when you grow up?

73
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,030
A great scholar.

74
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,430
S-Scholar?

75
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,370
A tail?

76
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,570
Yeah. Just like I had before, right?

77
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,670
You're right!

78
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:48,750
S-Say, does anything happen to
your boy that's strange in particular?

79
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,250
Strange?

80
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,750
F-For example, does he undergo any
changes on nights when the moon is full?

81
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,960
Nights when the moon is full?
Well, we all go to sleep early and all...

82
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,600
How come?

83
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,700
It's nothing, it's nothing!
In that case, it's all right!

84
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,270
S-Say, Goku, is your boy strong, like you?

85
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,740
About that...

86
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,040
I think he has quite a bit of power,

87
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,050
but Chichi gets mad
when I try to train Gohan.

88
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,250
Rock scissors paper!

89
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,850
How come? That's such a waste, isn't it?

90
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,420
Ain't it, though?

91
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,030
She says the world is at peace now,
so we don't need martial arts anymore,

92
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,560
and that from now on, it's time for studying.

93
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,580
So that tomboy of a girl turned out to
be an education-minded-mama<i>-san</i>, huh?

94
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,710
Say, is that thing on top
of Gohan<i>-kun</i>'s hat a Dragon Ball?

95
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,280
Yeah. It's <i>Si Xing Qiu</i>, the Four-Star-Ball.

96
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,710
It's a keepsake from my grandpa, you know?

97
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,280
I searched it out and stuck it on there.

98
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:04,490
I also found <i>San Xing Qiu</i> and <i>Liu Xing Qiu</i>
while I was at it. I keep them at home.

99
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,170
That sure takes me back. Dragon Balls, huh?

100
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you going to gather the Dragon Balls
together and wish for something else?

101
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,140
I ain't got anything
special that I want to wish for.

102
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,820
<i>And here I thought that now that Goku has</i>
<i>a family, his power might have diminished...</i>

103
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,990
You've got incredible power,
the same as ever, huh?

104
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,030
W-What is that?!

105
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,030
What's wrong?

106
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,470
S-Something's coming this way!

107
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,610
Something's coming?

108
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,580
I wonder if it's Yamucha.

109
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,420
<i>A-Awesome! I feel an</i>
<i>awesome power! What is it?!</i>

110
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,330
<i>It's here!</i>

111
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,700
<i>Here it comes!</i>

112
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,870
W-What is that?!

113
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
<i>Who is it?</i>

114
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,690
<i>What kind of ferocious bloodlust is this?</i>

115
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:06,410
So, we finally meet.

116
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,720
You've grown, huh?

117
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,060
But I still recognized you
at first glance, Kakarrot.

118
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
Kakarrot?

119
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,220
You look just like Father.

120
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,760
What does that mean?

121
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
What is this? What is this guy saying?

122
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,630
Kakarrot! What is with
the condition of this planet?!

123
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,240
You were supposed to have been
under orders to dispose of humanity!

124
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,610
What the hell have you
been goofing around for?

125
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,050
Now look here, you. I don't know
who you are or where you're from,

126
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,650
but go on back, go on back!

127
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,790
Shoo, shoo! You know,

128
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:50,390
it won't do for you to be out
drunk this early in the afternoon.

129
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,420
Go on back, go on back.

130
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,630
Kuririn! Don't get close to him!

131
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,930
Kuririn!

132
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,870
Why, you-!

133
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,630
A-A tail! This guy has a tail!

134
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,200
Looks like you've finally learned my identity.

135
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,070
Your identity?

136
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,470
What do you mean?!

137
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,540
Over here!

138
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,880
Kakarrot!

139
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,310
Have you even forgotten about that?!

140
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,320
My name ain't that funny
Kaka-whatever nonsense! It's Son Goku!

141
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,090
How can this be?

142
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Hey, go on, now!

143
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,240
Hey, have you ever taken any
strong shocks to the head in the past?

144
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,200
What?

145
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,180
Back when you were a child or sometime,
did you ever hit your head hard?!

146
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,180
Answer my question!

147
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,980
I did!

148
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,980
I don't remember it, but when I
was good and little, I hit my head!

149
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,520
W-What?!

150
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,850
I still have the scar, even now.

151
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:30,150
So that's it after all, huh?

152
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:32,420
But what does that
have to do with anything?!

153
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,930
Goku!

154
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:40,270
Long ago, your grandfather,
Son Gohan, told me something.

155
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:47,170
One day, deep in a valley, he found something
unusual, like it had fallen from the sky.

156
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,380
When he got closer and looked at it,
there was a round capsule,

157
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,440
and inside it was a baby that had a tail.

158
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,890
He took him home, and tried to raise him...

159
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,960
...but he had a violent
disposition, and never took to him,

160
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,300
and he was utterly at his wit's end over him.

161
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,300
But then, one day, he fell
into a ravine by accident...

162
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,070
...and hit his head hard,
nearly dying. However,

163
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,270
having an unbelievable life force,
the baby apparently survived.

164
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,280
What's more, afterward,
his violent nature disappeared,

165
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,310
and he became a good little boy.

166
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,660
T-That was me?

167
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,890
Mm-hmm.

168
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,390
S-So then, what does that mean?

169
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,770
Does this guy and Son<i>-kun</i>
have some kind of connection?

170
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,470
Hey, who the hell are you?!
Tell me who you are!

171
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,910
You're being one difficult bastard,
forgetting everything like this!

172
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,110
Fine. I'll remind you, then.

173
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:06,510
From here on, I'll have a lot of
work for you to do for me, after all...

174
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,990
Are you okay, Kuririn?

175
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,990
Be careful, Goku!
That's no ordinary guy!

176
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,500
Mm-hmm, so it would appear.

177
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,460
To be honest,

178
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,770
just us standing here looking at
each other like this has got me scared!

179
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,440
This has never happened to me before!

180
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,970
I'll tell you, then. You are
not a human from this planet.

181
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,780
You were born on Planet Vegeta.

182
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,450
You are a proud Saiyan, the
mightiest warrior race in the universe!

183
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,020
The universe?

184
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,720
Warriors?

185
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,720
Saiyan?

186
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,700
And I am your older brother, Raditz!

187
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,900
G-Goku's older brother?!

188
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,000
B-Brothers?! You're kidding!

189
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,010
Stop talking nonsense!

190
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,680
R-Right! If Goku is from outer space,
then what is he doing on Earth?!

191
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,350
The answer is simple.
Kakarrot, you were sent here

192
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,990
to exterminate the bothersome
humans that live on this planet!

193
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,320
I was what?!

194
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,060
We Saiyans are a renowned warrior race!

195
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,830
Our task is to go through space,

196
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:30,570
searching for planets
with good environments,

197
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,140
and once we've exterminated
those who already live there,

198
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:42,250
we sell them for a high price to aliens
who are looking for a suitable planet.

199
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,220
Adult warriors embark directly upon planets

200
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,920
where those with a higher battle power live.

201
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,020
But to planets like this one,
which have a lower level,

202
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,560
we send babies like you.

203
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,570
I-If that's the truth,
then you guys are awful!

204
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,140
That's crazy! You even
make Piccolo look lovable!

205
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,480
How can you send babies off on their own?!

206
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,420
Kakarrot,

207
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,920
given several years,

208
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,990
you should have had plenty of time
to purge these nuisances all by yourself!

209
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,660
If only you had
remembered your orders, that is.

210
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,570
Luckily, this planet has a moon, as well.

211
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,140
Hey, why is it so lucky
that there's a moon here?

212
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,580
Don't play stupid! It is
when the moon is at its fullest

213
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,980
that we Saiyans are at our best, you know!

214
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,320
What are you talking about?

215
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,920
I don't understand what you mean at all!

216
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,150
What?

217
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,160
I-It can't be... Where's your tail?

218
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,230
What happened to your tail?!

219
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,830
It got cut off and disappeared long ago!

220
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,810
H-How can this be? You miserable fool!

221
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,380
It's no wonder you were able to get
along with the beings on this planet!

222
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,390
Enough!

223
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,480
It doesn't matter if I <i>am</i>
some whatever-you-call-it guy

224
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,150
from another planet,
or if you <i>are</i> my big brother!

225
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,560
Kuririn is right!
Anyone like that is a lowlife!

226
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,000
I am Son Goku, and I was raised here!
Now get out of here right now!

227
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,160
Right! Right!

228
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,230
Like he said!
Whatever his past may be,

229
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,140
right now, Son Goku is a fine Earthling,
more so than anyone else!

230
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,010
Goku has even saved the world!
Get lost! Get lost!

231
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,860
Even so, I cannot allow this to be.

232
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,150
The Saiyans have always
been a race few in numbers,

233
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,160
but now, after colliding with a giant meteor,

234
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,960
the planet Vegeta has blown up.

235
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,740
Just about all of the Saiyans
were vaporized into space dust.

236
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,800
Our father and mother included!

237
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,410
Including you, there are
only four remaining Saiyans.

238
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,020
Me and one of the others were spared
because we were off assaulting another planet.

239
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,020
And as for the other one, he was lucky
enough to be sent off to another planet,

240
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,260
just like you were.

241
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,890
Earlier, we inadvertently found a nice planet

242
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,600
that we ought to be able to
sell for an extremely high price.

243
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,200
We'd like to go attack it,

244
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,570
but it looks like we'd have a hard
time of it with just the three of us.

245
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,910
That's when I remembered
about you, Kakarrot.

246
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,780
Your battle power is still incomplete,

247
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,080
but if you were to join up with the
three of us, you could still manage.

248
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,580
Stay away!

249
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,960
Open your eyes, Kakarrot!

250
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,590
It will be fun! Is your
Saiyan blood not stirred?

251
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm scared!

252
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,330
Don't be ridiculous!

253
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,810
I'd die before lending my hand to you!

254
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,700
So that's how it is, huh?

255
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,570
For a while now, I've been wondering,

256
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,580
that boy behind you is your son, isn't he?

257
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,150
N-No!

258
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,150
It's no use trying to fool me!

259
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,890
That tail is proof that he
carries Saiyan blood, isn't it?

260
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,490
So... what if he is?!

261
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,930
Since you, his father,
won't listen to reason,

262
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:56,810
I guess I'll have to borrow
your son for a little while.

263
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,450
Keep back!

264
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,320
Just try to come any closer!

265
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,190
I'll knock you flying!

266
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,030
Father!

267
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,510
–Father!
–You mustn't go!

268
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,610
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

269
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,510
Whoa, there!

270
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:48,750
Kakarrot, I'll be taking the child.
If you want him returned alive,

271
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,060
you'll listen to what
your brother tells you to do!

272
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,600
D-Dammit!

273
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,100
G-Goku went down with only one blow!

274
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,340
Kakarrot, I'm giving you
only one day, so think about it.

275
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,110
You'll probably have to
get your friends to help, too.

276
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:17,280
Still, you'll have to show me some proof.

277
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,050
Ah, but that's a simple matter.
By this time tomorrow,

278
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,230
you'll kill a hundred of this
planet's humans, at least for now,

279
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,890
and pile their bodies up here!

280
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,330
What?!

281
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,280
You heard me, right? I'll be
looking forward to tomorrow.

282
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,970
He is my brother's son, after all.

283
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,480
If possible, I don't
want to have to kill him.

284
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,780
Father!

285
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,190
I'm scared!

286
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,980
G-Gohan!

287
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,110
<i>Exceedingly strong,</i>
<i>and exceedingly cold-blooded,</i>

288
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:21,150
<i>he's Goku's brother, Raditz!</i>

289
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:27,680
<i>Will Goku be able to</i>
<i>save his son, Son Gohan?</i>

290
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,370
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

291
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:54,240
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

292
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,620
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

293
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,120
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

294
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:11,600
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

295
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,700
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

296
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,200
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

297
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,870
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

298
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:29,380
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

299
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,420
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

300
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,290
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

301
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,360
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

302
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,030
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

303
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,200
<i>So sorry.</i>

304
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,300
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

305
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:00,280
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

306
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,960
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

307
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,260
<i>Wah! Father!</i>

308
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,360
<i>No fair, Raditz! Give me back my child, Gohan!</i>
