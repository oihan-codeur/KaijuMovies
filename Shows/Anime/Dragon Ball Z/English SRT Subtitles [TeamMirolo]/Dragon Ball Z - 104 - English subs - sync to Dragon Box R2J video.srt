<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:55,230
There ain't any reason to kill you,
now that you've started trembling.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,400
You should go on living with the shock
you have undergone here in tranquility.

18

Nevertheless.

19
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,750
Am I to have lost?!

20
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,050
You're an impossible fool!

21
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,760
I had given you one last chance!

22
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,330

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,100
I won't fall for such an old trick!

27
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,740
Got you!

28
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,370
Over here, Freeza!

29
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,050
That was an after image, huh?

30
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,430
The monkey's not too bad, is he?

31
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:15,060
I just can't bring myself
to fight with you any more.

32
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,770
Not if you're pinning all your
hopes on such a petty technique.

33
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,710
If you absolutely have to settle this with me,

34
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:27,910
then regain your strength
and brush up on your skills.

35
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,750
<i>Petty technique, you say?</i>

36
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,420
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what has happened?

37
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,060
F-Freeza there is trembling...

38
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,070
Then, that means Goku has won!

39
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,100
Goku is fighting with
composure to spare. But... but...

40
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,770
There's no time!

41
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,250
Only moments remain
until Planet Namek explodes!

42
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,720
M-My technique... is a
petty technique, you say?!

43
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,400
In that case, how about two of them?!

44
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,410
You ignorant fool!

45
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,090
Someone who uses the
same pattern lacks innovation!

46
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,070
Kakarrot and Freeza will both be
destroyed along with Planet Namek!

47
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,430
There's no longer anyone in my way!

48
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:09,430
I, Vegeta<i>-sama</i>, am the
greatest in the universe!

49
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,090
I've been waiting for this day.

50
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,440
Having endured the
humiliation, being at Freeza's side...

51
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,060
We did it!

52
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,930
This battle has left me worn ragged!

53
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,800
I'd like to hurry up and
get to a recuperation capsule!

54
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,370
With just the three of us,
we subjugated Planet Shatts!

55
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,380
Quite a feat!

56
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,410
I wonder what Freeza<i>-sama</i> will give us.

57
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,060
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, we have just
returned from Planet Shatts.

58
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,390
They gave us a little trouble,

59
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,060
but we were able to conquer
them in three days' time.

60
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,970
Hmm, is that so?

61
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,600
Three days for such a planet...

62
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,590
I see. Please stand aside.

63
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,100
J-Just a minute! Is that all?!

64
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,400
We ran ourselves ragged, you know!

65
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,730
What about that?!

66
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,070
Zarbon<i>-san</i>, how long would it
take you to subjugate that planet?

67
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,410
Sir. If I were to have one day's time,
I am sure it would be enough.

68
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,740
I would think so.

69
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,620
It is such a tiny planet, after all.

70
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,300
Is there anything else?

71
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,200
I am quite busy.

72
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,570
If not, you may stand aside.

73
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,370
You filthy rat!

74
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,410
Stop, Nappa!

75
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:20,090
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, if you will excuse us...

76
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,070
You monkey scum.

77
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,160
Vegeta, doesn't it upset you?

78
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,560
I heard something–our world, Planet Vegeta,

79
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,200
was not destroyed in a collision
with another planet–or so they say!

80
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,870
What's that?

81
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,870
It was all Freeza's doing!

82
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,880
I-It was what?!

83
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,550
Vegeta, your father,
King Vegeta, being killed...

84
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,550
...as well as the destruction
of our homeland, Planet Vegeta,

85
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,250
it was all done under the
direction of Freeza there!

86
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,890
I'm aware of it!

87
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,360
Y-You knew?!

88
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,900
In that case, why the hell
are we working for that guy?!

89
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,770
Whoever may have killed my old man,

90
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,410
whoever may have destroyed my home,

91
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,080
that sort of thing doesn't matter to me.

92
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:59,590
In this world, strength is everything!

93
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,730
The strong stand at the top,
and subdue everyone else.

94
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:11,070
I know of Freeza's boundless strength.

95
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,570
There's no way I can stand against him now.

96
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,240
But just you watch!

97
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,240
We Saiyans have the blood of a
warrior race running though us!

98
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,910
And so, the more we fight,
the stronger we get!

99
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,520
Just watch me get stronger and stronger!

100
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,190
And then, one day,

101
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:36,520
I will take the place of Freeza,
and rule the entire universe!

102
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,730
I have the power within me.

103
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,870
At last, that time has come.

104
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,400
Kakarrot and Freeza are going down together!

105
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,720
Father will not die!

106
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,590
He is certain to come home alive!

107
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:17,530
You keep on spouting that nonsense.

108
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:22,070
Father will defeat Freeza,
and will surely return to Earth!

109
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,890
Lousy monkey!

110
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,590
These will follow you wherever you may go!

111
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,900
You think you can get away?!

112
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,770
You're going to be sliced to pieces!

113
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,920
He'll never learn.

114
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,430
Hmph! Someone who uses the
same pattern lacks innovation!

115
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,110
Dammit! You expect me to
fall for such a childish trick?!

116
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,780
Where is that monkey scum?!

117
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,770
You're no longer a match for me!

118
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,280
Get him! Attaboy! Nice going, Goku!

119
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,450
Right there! Give it to him! Goku!

120
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,620
I will not be beaten by that monkey scum!

121
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,290
Don't stand up! Get down!

122
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,920
Get down!

123
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:59,760
I-It can't be...!

124
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,910
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what is it?!

125
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,740
D-Don't tell us Goku has lost!

126
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,080
Freeza's been...

127
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,420
cut clean in two!

128
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,390
Even though you may reap
what you sow, this ain't like you.

129
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,090
What a miserable end!

130
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Somehow or other, I'm going back to Earth.

131
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,570
Now share the same
fate as this Planet Namek,

132
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,780
which you yourself have destroyed.

133
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,770
Help...

134
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:46,270
H-Help...

135
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,440
Help... me...

136
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,690
G-Goku! What are you dawdling around for?!

137
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,220
Hurry and take off!

138
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:23,200
P-Please... s... s...

139
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,070
Save me!

140
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,090
Save...

141
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:42,560
Save me!

142
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,730
You dare ask anything for yourself?!

143
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,200
You... you...

144
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,870
How many people have you killed as
they begged for their lives like that?!

145
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:55,540
Please... save... me!

146
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,070
Please!

147
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,080
Freeza...

148
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,230
I've shared a little bit of my <i>ki</i> with you.

149
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:30,200
Knowing you, you should be
able to move, even in your shape.

150
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,080
The rest is up to you!

151
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:30,100
<i>Goku and Freeza's ceaseless conflict</i>
<i>has come to a conclusion. However...</i>

152
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,280
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

153
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,120
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

154
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,490

<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

156
