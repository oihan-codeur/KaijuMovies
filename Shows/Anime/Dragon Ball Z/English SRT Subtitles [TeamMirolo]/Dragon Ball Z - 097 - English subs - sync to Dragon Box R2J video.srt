00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

<i>Sparking!</i>

00:02:15,805 --> 00:02:19,265
W-Wh-What the hell are you?!

17
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,965
As you are surely well aware...

18
00:02:23,315 --> 00:02:28,145
I am the Saiyan who came
from Earth to defeat you.

19
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:31,915
Despite my calm, quiet heart,

20
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:35,615
I am the legendary warrior,
awakened by intense anger.

21
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:51,265
I am the Super Saiyan, Son Goku!!

<i>"The Destruction of Planet Namek!?</i>
<i>A Demonic Flash Pierces the Ground."</i>

I-Indeed.

24
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:14,915
It appears that somehow
you really are a Super Saiyan.

25
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:26,405
Having a calm, quiet heart,
then awakened by intense anger, huh?

26
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:27,705
I see.

27
00:03:27,745 --> 00:03:32,235
Which is why no matter how hard Vegeta
worked at it, he could not become one.

28
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:54,395
<i>Kuririn-san... Dende... Father</i>

<i>He will surely win, and avenge you,</i>
<i>Kuririn-san and Dende!</i>

30
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:38,105
You bastard!

31
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:49,785
<i>W-What humiliation on my part!</i>

32
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:52,755
<i>That I–that Freeza-sama</i>
<i>should take this from him–</i>

33

34

<i>It's unbelievable! I didn't think</i>
<i>this sort of thing could happen!</i>

35
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:23,455
Contact with the gentlemen from the
Ginyu Special Corps has been cut off,

36
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:26,785
and the signal from Freeza<i>-sama</i>'s
Scouter has also disappeared!

37
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:31,455
What... what the hell is
happening on Planet Namek?!

38
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,795
Perhaps it has finally come!

39
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:36,465
A new era, that is!

40
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:37,795
A new era?

41
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:42,645
Freeza, the one who wiped out
my species, has finally been defeated!

42
00:06:12,175 --> 00:06:15,465
You miserable fool!

43
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:17,805
C-Commander!

44
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,745
That we may stand here this day,

45
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:25,145
triumphant over the rest of the
universe, is due entirely to Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

46
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,485
And that is not all,

47
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:31,815
he has promised me that some day, my
clan would be raised higher than any other!

48
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:34,795
Isn't that true of your races as well?!

49
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:42,725
Freeza<i>-sama</i> is the
very savior of the universe!

50
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:45,435
Treachery will not be tolerated!

51
00:06:51,815 --> 00:06:54,445
Signal on sensors! It is Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

52
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:57,445
It's an incredible battle power reading!

53
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:01,785
That's it! Freeza<i>-sama</i> must
finally have gotten serious!

54
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:05,115
Another one! What is
this other giant reading?

55
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:06,455
What's the matter?!

56
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,125
There is another, incredible
reading right near Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

57
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,795
What?!

58
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:14,465
I will give you a level reading.

59
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:57,475
You're finished, Freeza.

60
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:07,155
I-I...

61
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:11,085
I am Freeza!

62
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,455
You're telling me I'm finished?!

63
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:28,065
That's it!

64
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:33,445
The spaceship that Father rode here in!

65
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:47,085
Still not yet?!

66
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:50,455
If you don't cut that out,
I'm really goin' to get angry!

67
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:55,855
I have mentioned that this
would be a piece of cake–yeow!

68
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:59,895
–if you would not rush me so.

69
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:08,465
Someone has gotten
aboard Goku's spaceship!

70
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:16,075
I installed sensor devices in there.

71
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,105
So, who could it be?

72
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,785
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

73
00:10:30,795 --> 00:10:34,795
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, wait here a moment.

74
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:39,595
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

75
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:41,105
Mother!

76
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:45,105
Gohan<i>-chan</i>! You're alive, aren't ya?!

77
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,135
Thank goodness! Really, thank goodness!

78
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:52,445
Mother!

79
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,745
–Gohan, what about Goku?!
–What are you doin'?!

80
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:58,315
How are Goku and Kuririn?!

81
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:02,925
Father is fighting against Freeza.

82
00:11:02,965 --> 00:11:06,095
Kuririn<i>-san</i> has died.

83
00:11:06,135 --> 00:11:07,765
W-What did you say?!

84
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:09,095
I'm sorry,

85
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:13,435
I don't have the time to go into
detailed circumstances right now.

86
00:11:13,475 --> 00:11:15,965
<i>I have to go get Bulma-san!</i>

87
00:11:16,815 --> 00:11:19,775
Gohan<i>-chan</i>! Don't you be goin' anywhere!

88
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:21,445
You stay right where you are!

89
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:25,815
–I'm waiting here for you!
–Wait, Gohan! Wait, I say!

90
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:46,735
If it is to come down to me
being killed by the likes of you,

91
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:50,105
I will choose death by my own hand!

92
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:53,445
Whichever you like.

93
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:16,765
Fool. You expect me to die?

94
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:19,465
It is you who will die.

95
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:24,235
I can continue to live,
even in the vacuum of space.

96
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,775
I wonder though, how about you Saiyans?

97
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:38,115
Now perish, together
with this whole planet!!

98
00:12:39,795 --> 00:12:41,785
Blow up!!

99
00:12:58,475 --> 00:13:02,145
Now perish, together
with this whole planet!!

100
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,115
Oh no!!

101
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:44,585
W-What is it? What's that light?!

102
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,285
Gohan<i>-chan</i>! Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

103
00:13:57,135 --> 00:14:00,475
What is this? What's happening?!

104
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:18,815
Father!

105
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:03,625
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

106
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:14,605
D-Don't tell me...!

107
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:18,605
Son Goku did well.

108
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:23,755
Against Freeza,

109
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:29,925
his overwhelming strength proved
him entirely triumphant in their battle.

110
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:32,055
So then, Goku is...?

111
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:35,125
He's defeated Freeza, hasn't he?

112
00:15:35,165 --> 00:15:39,795
No. Having been cornered, Freeza...

113
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:50,915
...destroyed the entire planet of Namek itself.

114
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:55,115
So then, what about Goku and the others?

115
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:59,755
If the planet is lost, no one can survive.

116
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:02,885
No one except Freeza.

117
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:05,795
T-That can't be!

118
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:12,895
It's over. All of it.

119
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:15,565
Kaio<i>-sama...</i>

120
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:20,245
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, are you able to hear me?

121
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:26,145
It is I, the Kami of Earth.

122
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,485
Yeah. What is it? I hear you!

123
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:35,455
I am now having Mister Popo
gather the Dragon Balls of Earth.

124
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:40,295
I believe he will have all
seven together very shortly.

125
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:42,295
Is that so?

126
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:45,095
If I could have you wait briefly,

127
00:16:45,135 --> 00:16:51,475
I can have those who have
been in your care resurrected.

128
00:16:53,845 --> 00:16:59,805
However, Chaozu there is
now dead a second time, and so...

129
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,155
That is...

130
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:09,665
J-Just a moment! Are you alive?

131
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:15,865
Y-Yes, gratefully so, thanks to
the Dragon Balls of Planet Namek...

132
00:17:15,905 --> 00:17:21,205
Which would mean that
Piccolo is not dead either, correct?

133
00:17:21,245 --> 00:17:27,475
A-As I believe you are aware, myself
and Piccolo were originally one single...

134
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:30,145
That's right! Then perhaps...

135
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:31,775
Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

136
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:43,485
Er, Kaio<i>-sama</i>? Kaio<i>-sama</i>?
Are you hearing me?

137
00:17:43,525 --> 00:17:46,155
Hey, keep it down!

138
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,965
What a start!

139
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,885
<i>I-I'm not going to let myself die</i>

140
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:18,455
<i>in a place like this!</i>

141
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:42,125
<i>Father!</i>

142
00:18:56,505 --> 00:19:00,235
Planet Namek has not been lost!

143
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:06,805
Goku and Gohan and Piccolo and
the girl called Bulma are all alive!

144
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:10,645
–All right!
–All right!

145
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:13,555
–Thank goodness!
–Okay!

146
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,815
I restrained my power too much, didn't I?

147
00:19:46,855 --> 00:19:52,485
That's because you were fearful of
being caught in the explosion of the planet.

148
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,825
You failed.

149
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:04,995
As a result, I've hung on to life.

150
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,775
Hung on to life, you say?

151
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:14,435
You don't seem to understand at all, do you?

152
00:20:15,515 --> 00:20:19,145
You have avoided the
planet's instantaneous explosion,

153
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:22,745
but I've completely destroyed its core.

154
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:26,125
Do you understand what that means?

155
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:31,125
Five more minutes.

156
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,865
Five more minutes,

157
00:20:34,905 --> 00:20:39,895
and then Planet Namek will undergo
a great explosion, becoming space dust!

158
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:03,085
Five minutes will be plenty.

159
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:08,465
I will defeat you, then leave
together with my friends in my spaceship.

160
00:21:11,835 --> 00:21:16,465
Unfortunately for you,
it will be I who can hope to do so.

161
00:21:16,505 --> 00:21:21,475
At least, it's a much
greater hope than you have.

162
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:26,775
In this event, I will show
you my 100 percent full power!

163
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:30,755
There's no way you can defeat me!
Prepare yourself for this!

164
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:34,455
Why wait until now for full power?

165
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,755
I know why.

166
00:21:38,795 --> 00:21:43,465
If you used all your power,
your body couldn't withstand it!

167
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:48,235
I can't let you stall for any more time!

168
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:51,265
I'm going to settle this now!

169
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:08,155
<i>There are five minutes until</i>
<i>the destruction of Planet Namek.</i>

170
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:29,975
<i>What will be the outcome of this fierce battle</i>?

171
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:48,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

172
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

173
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

174
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

175
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

176
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,985
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

177
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:19,495
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

178
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

179
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

180
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

181
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

182
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

183
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

184
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

185
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

186
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,565
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

187
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:13,745
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

188
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,585
<i>Freeza ain't holding back anymore.</i>

189
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:17,655
<i>He's finally planning to</i>
<i>take me on at full power.</i>

190
00:24:17,695 --> 00:24:22,225
<i>Sorry to keep you waiting. Here</i>
<i>is the 100% full power you wanted.</i>

191
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:26,495
<i>I'm going to fight you at your best, and win!</i>

192
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:28,425
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

193
00:24:28,465 --> 00:24:32,135
<i>"I Will Be the One Who Wins...</i>
<i>Risking Survival, a Final Attack."</i>

194
00:24:32,175 --> 00:24:35,975
<i>Father, hurry! The planet is about to...</i>

195
00:24:36,015 --> 00:24:38,245
"Next time"
"I Will Be the One Who Wins...
Risking Survival, a Final Attack"
