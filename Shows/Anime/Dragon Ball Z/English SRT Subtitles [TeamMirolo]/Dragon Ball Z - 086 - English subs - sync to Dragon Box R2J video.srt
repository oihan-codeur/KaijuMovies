<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,050
<i>Unable to do anything before</i>
<i>the overwhelming power of Freeza,</i>

17
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>Vegeta thoroughly loses his will to fight.</i>

18
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,060
<i>Until finally, Vegeta's death draws near.</i>

19
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,930
<i>At that moment...</i>

20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,410
<i>Son Goku finally rises!</i>

21
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,760
<i>"Such Regret...!!</i>
<i>Vegeta, Pride of the Saiyans, Dies."</i>

22
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,700
Damn...

23
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,990
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

24
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,200
All right, they're very close.

25
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,070
My apologies, I'm coming now!
Something might just become of this!

26
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,760
How dull. You've utterly
lost the will to fight back.

27
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,180
It's a little soon, but
maybe I should finish you off.

28
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,510
So then, the identity of that
huge <i>ki</i> was Piccolo after all.

29
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,380
S-Son!

30
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:14,220
Nice. You were brought back
here with the Dragon Balls, huh?

31
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,050
Father!

32
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,390
Are you all right now?

33
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:23,420
Yeah. Thanks to you guys,
I've recovered from all that damage.

34
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,270
You've stuck it out well,
Gohan! Leave it up to me now.

35
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,300
What?!

36
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,280
Leave it up to you? What, are you
planning on taking that freak on by yourself?

37
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,980
Yep.

38
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,810
Father!

39
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,890
A-Are you really Goku?

40
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,290
There's something different about
the way your <i>ki</i> has felt up until now...

41
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,290
S-Son!

42
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,060
<i>Is that Son? He's got an</i>
<i>unbelievable strength of ki.</i>

43
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,440
<i>There's no comparison</i>
<i>to when he was on Earth.</i>

44
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,050
So you're Freeza?

45
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,760
You're much more of
a runt than I'd imagined.

46
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,760
So there's still another one of you scum left?

47
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,740
Vegeta has promised to fight with me.

48
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,770
Don't you interfere!

49
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,440
You... It's like I've seen you before...

50
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,990
K-Kakarrot, it's you...

51
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,470
K-Kakarrot? But that name is Saiyan.

52
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,770
It's him!

53
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,440
Freeza! Get out here!

54
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,420
I won't let you get away with this!

55
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:47,900
<i>He looks just like that last Saiyan who</i>
<i>opposed me when I destroyed planet Vegeta.</i>

56
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,900
I won't let a single one of you Saiyans live.

57
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,940
Don't you see, you would do
well just to tremble before me.

58
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,420
Maybe so.

59
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,380
<i>H-He's not the same Kakarrot as before...</i>

60
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:13,390
<i>He's at last climbed over</i>
<i>the wall of his limitations...</i>

61
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,760
<i>W-Which means...</i>

62
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,490
Are you ready, then?

63
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,060
Yeah.

64
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,090
W-What was that?
Did Goku just do something?

65
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,020
Unreal!

66
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:52,230
<i>Not even I could see that clearly.</i>
<i>He's exceeded Freeza's speed!</i>

67
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,250
Oh, no! Get out of the way, Goku!

68
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,040
Oh, no! Get out of the way, Goku!

69
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,570
You're an impudent one!

70
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,540
It can't be! He deflected every
one of them, and with just one hand!

71
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,110
Freeza, you'd better fight like you mean it!

72
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:33,130
H-He's the very thing you fear most...

73
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,060
A Super Saiyan!

74
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,200
That's right!

75
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,080
The strongest warrior in
the universe, a Super Saiyan!

76
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,750
Freeza, you're finished now! Serves you right!

77
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,070
Vegeta!

78
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:29,640
You knew, Vegeta, that I hate
such petty jokes, didn't you?

79
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,980
Vegeta!

80
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,980
Hey! Vegeta was in a state
where he couldn't even move!

81
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,990
There was no reason to
finish him off on purpose!

82
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:43,990
The Super Saiyan is nothing
more than a frivolous legend.

83
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,100
He wouldn't stop going on about it.
I hate it when people get tedious.

84
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,540
–K-Kakarrot...
–Vegeta!

85
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:06,580
Are you... still reciting that soft crap?
Are you not a Super Saiyan?!

86
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,920
Wait!

87
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:19,560
You foolish scum! Get cold-hearted!

88
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,970
If you had only discarded your
leniency, you would surely already be...

89
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,740
...a Super Saiyan!

90
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:34,040
I just don't see how I could
act as cold-hearted as you do.

91
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,210
And as for this Super Saiyan
business, I don't know what you mean.

92
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:43,490
A-A Super Saiyan is...

93
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,200
How wonderful!

94
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,370
Look at it, Zarbon<i>-san</i>, Dodoria<i>-san</i>!

95
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,570
Behold such beautiful fireworks!

96
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:48,090
L-Listen well, Kakarrot...

97
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,050
And here I've pierced his heart.

98
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,960
What nerve. Are you going to keep talking?

99
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:05,030
Your... our planet of birth,
Planet Vegeta... was not destroyed...

100
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:11,410
i-in a collision with a giant meteor...

101
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,810
Don't say any more!

102
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,650
You're just hastening your death!

103
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,650
Freeza did it...!

104
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:30,560
This after we Saiyans...
served as his hands and feet...

105
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,230
working exactly as he ordered...!

106
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,670
Everyone besides us was killed...!

107
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:45,270
Your father... and my
father, the king, as well...!

108
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:51,380
Freeza... was afraid that as
the Saiyans gathered strength...

109
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:57,290
a Super Saiyan would be born among us...

110
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,090
Just listen to you.

111
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,760
Vegeta!

112
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:20,410
I-I beg you...! Freeza... defeat Freeza...!

113
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:31,120
Please... by your Saiyan hand...

114
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,740
<i>Vegeta...</i>

115
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,240
Has he finally croaked?

116
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,950
Well, shall we reconvene
this Show of Terror, then?

117
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,620
For you to cry...

118
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:10,000
For you to beg of me, must
have been awfully difficult, I bet.

119
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,700
I understand.

120
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,740
It wasn't that your fellow Saiyans
had been killed that was rough on you–

121
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:10,090
Having to do as he told you must have
been worse than anything you could stand.

122
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,760
I hated you so much...

123
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,770
...but you had your Saiyan pride.

124
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:53,090
And now I too will share in
some of that pride of yours.

125
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,770
I am a Saiyan raised on Earth!

126
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,410
For all the Saiyans who were killed by you...

127
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:10,440
...as well as for all the Namekians here...

128
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:15,580
I am going to beat you!

129
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,420
Such drivel.

130
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:26,290
<i>Son Goku opens his eyes to his Saiyan pride.</i>

131
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,200
<i>Just how great is his terrible anger?</i>

132
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

133
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

134
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,860
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

135
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,360
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

136
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,870
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

137
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

138
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

139
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,120
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

140
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

141
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

142
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

143
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

144
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

145
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,410
<i>So sorry.</i>

146
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

147
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

148
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,440
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

149
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,370
<i>Freeza! Don't go messing up</i>
<i>other people's planets so much!</i>

150
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,040
<i>What will you do once you break it?!</i>

151
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,310
<i>These Saiyan characters are strange ones.</i>

152
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,280
<i>There's no upper limit to his strength.</i>

153
