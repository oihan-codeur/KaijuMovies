<i>He was happily living the free</i>

22
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,840

Just– Hey–Cut that out, will you, Goku?

25
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:00,670
Hey! This is dangerous! Stop it! Hey!

26
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,480
The Serpentine Road
is as long as ever, huh?

27
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,940
So, Kaio-<i>sama</i>, can't you run a little faster?

28
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,730
Goku, there's no reason to be in such a rush.

29
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,360
We are utterly dead, here.
We've got plenty of time.

30
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,330
But I want to hurry and meet
these masters of the Next World!

31
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,500
I want to fight them,
and see how strong they are!

32
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,670
That may be easy for you to say,

33
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,880
but if you take the masters
of the Next World too lightly,

34
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,540
you'll get yourself in a big mess.

35
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,710
Those dudes are really that strong?
These masters of the Next World?

36
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,130
Now look here!

37
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,550
I won't have you calling them "dudes"!

38
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,970
With all due respect to him,

39
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,720
the masters include the greatest
gentleman in the Next World!

40
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,850
The Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

41
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,640
The Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>...?

42
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,650
The Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you see...

43
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,330
The Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>
stands at the head of us Kaio,

44
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,330
who preside over the North,
South, East, and West Galaxies,

45
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,040
and is the most important, most
powerful person in the Next World.

46
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,510
On top of that, the Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>
is a great fan of the martial arts.

47
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,510
On Grand Kaio's World, those
fighters who are champions of justice,

48
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,520
who, like yourself, have been given
special bodies, engage in daily training.

49
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,860
Now I want to meet this Grand
Kaio guy all that much sooner!

50
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,330
Oh yeah, I can fly!

51
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,550
Whoopsie, whoopsie!

52
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,550
I forgot to ask how to
get to Grand Kaio's World!

53
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,510
You get to Grand Kaio's
World by taking an airplane.

54
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,600
All right, an airplane, you say? Okay, then!

55
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,530
There's just no helping that guy.
I'll bet he comes back here again.

56
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,610
There, see! Here he comes!

57
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,370
So, where is this airplane?

58
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,960
It's at the airport next to
Great King Yama's castle,

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,330
for those that are going to heaven.

60
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,580
All right, got it! Later!

61
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,970
I wonder if he'll be coming back once more.

62
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,550
I sure hope he comes back.

63
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Here he comes! Here he comes!

64
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,030
If we're going to Great King Yama's
place, it's faster to go this way!

65
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,160
Goku! See here!

66
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,470
Okay, now, don't push.
Please observe your place in line.

67
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,510
You go to heaven.

68
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:48,900
Yay! Yay! I made it to heaven!
Yay! Yay! All right! Yay!

69
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,270
All right...

70
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,400
Bring in the next one.

71
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,860
Heya!

72
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,700
Of all the people it could have
been, if it isn't you, Son Goku!

73
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,540
Have you died again?
And you're here too, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

74
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,500
Well, a lot has happened
to bring us here, you see.

75
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,920
Well, Great King Yama, I need to hurry on ahead.

76
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,920
Whoa, won't you have some tea before you go?

77
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,340
Excuse me, there, we can't have you taking cuts.

78
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,340
You have to remain in line
and receive your judgment.

79
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,060
You've got a body...!

80
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,440
Y-You're one of those special
"free pass" people, aren't you?

81
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,530
You're the first one I've ever seen!

82
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,740
Frankly speaking, I am impressed!

83
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,370
Now, now, be my guest!

84
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,370
Th-Thank you...

85
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,080
Good grief, that guy just goes around
putting people out one after another.

86
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,420
Well, see you around, Yama!

87
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,840
Sure, take care.

88
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,180
So that's a body given
only to just martial artists,

89
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,810
that you can train with
even in the Next World?

90
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,020
Oh, Goku saved the Earth,
did he? That explains it...

91
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:30,540
Okay, those spirits in A Group
going to heaven, please follow me.

92
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,500
You there, don't get out of line.

93
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,670
Please be sure to follow right
behind the spirit in front of you,

94
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,670
so you don't get lost, okay?

95
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,010
Right!

96
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:56,020
How come our airplane is
the only one this run-down?

97
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,030
I wanted to ride on one
of those bigger airplanes.

98
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:09,030
Is that heaven? It sure is huge!

99
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,710
We're just about there, Goku.

100
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,880
Huh? Where, where? Where?

101
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,710
Look, look. Over there.

102
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,710
Huh? Where?

103
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,000
That is Grand Kaio's World.

104
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,260
Wow, it's a smaller planet than I imagined.

105
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,680
N-Now look here! How can you say that?!

106
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,390
Sorry, sorry. It's definitely much
bigger than your planet, Kaio-<i>sama.</i>

107
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,650
That's plenty rude in it's own right.

108
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,460
Awesome! These folks all
look pretty strong, all right.

109
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,260
Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

110
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,680
It's been so long!

111
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,260
Excuse us for not coming
to see you for so long.

112
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,560
Yeah, you're working hard, aren't you?

113
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,680
Yes.

114
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,140
Wow, Kaio-<i>sama</i>, you're pretty
famous here in the Next World.

115
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,270
They come from the North Galaxy, you see.

116
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,270
You mean, the same as me?

117
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:26,280
Yeah, which would make them
about 2,300 years your seniors.

118
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,700
2,300 years...?

119
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,870
Eh?! 2,300 years?!

120
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,210
They've been training
here for that long a time?!

121
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,630
45,303...

122
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,990
This is the Hall of the Grand Kaio,
where Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i> lives.

123
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,950
I'm about to meet the strongest
guy in the Next World, the Grand Kaio.

124
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,330
You'll call him Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

125
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,920
If you conduct yourself disrespectfully,
you're going to wind up hurting later!

126
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,090
Is that how strong he is? This Grand Kaio?

127
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,090
<i>Sama</i>!!

128
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,090
<i>Sama</i>, I meant.

129
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:35,760
The truth is, not even I have
seen Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i> fight before.

130
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,110
However, his fighting is
widely said to be so wonderful,

131
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,860
yet so terrible, that it
cannot be described in words.

132
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,410
Yeah! Th-This is it! This is the car that I wanted!

133
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,960
Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>, how nice,
how nice! I want one of these, too!

134
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,290
Oh, the hind end on this is so sexy!
Wow! It's the greatest! It's the greatest!

135
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,090
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, let's hurry up and go!

136
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,840
You!

137
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,470
W-What?!

138
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,980
Kaio of the West!

139
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,280
Huh?

140
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,920
What's going on? Eh? Eh?
What? What? What? What is this?

141
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,420
What are you doing here?!

142
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,210
What are you doing here yourself?!

143
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,470
Today, I'm here to see Paikuhan
here, after a long absence.

144
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,770
Paikuhan is the West Galaxy's
greatest martial artist, you know.

145
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,440
What?!

146
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,160
W-What?!

147
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,280
Wha–?!

148
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,920
Y-You've died, have you?!

149
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,550
Y-You mean this...?!

150
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,420
A Kaio that has died...!

151
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,510
This is much funnier
than any of your lousy jokes!

152
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,560
Lousy jokes? What do you mean, lousy jokes?!

153
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,640
There are a number of
circumstances that account for this.

154
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,190
I got Kaio-<i>sama</i> dragged into this.

155
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,440
Who is this kid?

156
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,860
Me? I'm Son Goku.

157
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:59,410
Goku is a just martial artist, who saved
a planet in the North Galaxy named Earth.

158
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,580
He's one exceptionally strong fellow.

159
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,960
What? You say he's exceptionally strong?

160
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,540
Ha! But he's not as
strong as Paikuhan here.

161
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,090
Nope. Goku is the stronger one.

162
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:17,510
Ridiculous! No, Paikuhan
is obviously the stronger one!

163
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,510
No, that would definitely be Goku!

164
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,310
It's definitely, definitely, Paikuhan!

165
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,140
You don't get it, do you?!

166
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,730
You're the one who doesn't get it!

167
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,060
In that case, how about
we let them fight?!

168
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,860
That's just what I wanted!

169
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,410
Okay, go get him, Goku!

170
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:43,120
Eh? Go get him? You mean, fight right here?

171
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,120
Paikuhan, put him away nice and easy!

172
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,960
Just a minute!

173
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,840
That voice!

174
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,500
It's the Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

175
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,840
Huh? Where?

176
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,590
Come on, come on,
come on, Goku! Bow your head!

177
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,120
Hii!

178
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,410
Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

179
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,090
<i>That's the Grand Kaio-sama?</i>

180
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,310
Forgive me for interrupting you
while you're busy, but Paikuhan-<i>chan,</i>

181
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,860
would you go to Ku-jigo for me for a little bit?

182
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,860
Yes, sir.

183
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,860
What's Ku-jigo?

184
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,320
He's talking about Jigoku.
[<i>Jigoku</i>: Hell]

185
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,490
You take the "ku" from Jigoku
and put it in front to get Ku-jigo.

186
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:04,160
Something troubling has cropped up in Ku-jigo.

187
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,120
Something troubling?

188
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,000
Recently, this guy named Cell was
sent to Ku-jigo by Ma-ya-<i>chan</i>, you see...

189
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,290
Cell?!

190
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,920
Cell, you go to hell!

191
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,850
This Cell, accompanied
by someone named Freeza,

192
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,310
is going around wreaking havoc.

193
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,520
–Cell?
–Together with Freeza and them?

194
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,110
So, I'd like for you to
go and take care of them.

195
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,940
As you wish.

196
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,530
You can't do it alone! I'm going with you!

197
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,950
G-Goku! You can't do this without permission!

198
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,530
Oh, it's okay.

199
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,280
Kaio-<i>chan</i> of the North, why
don't you let him do as he likes?

200
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,630
I don't remember anyone asking you to help.

201
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,090
You don't know Cell or Freeza,
which is why you can say that!

202
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,590
Those guys are awfully strong!

203
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,190
This is terrible.

204
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,110
Please <i>oni</i>!

205
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,530
I-If you would, let us go please <i>oni</i>!

206
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,870
Huh? If it ain't Gozu and Mezu!

207
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,960
You're the one who fell from the
Serpentine Road before! Son Goku!

208
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,960
Thank goodness we haven't
been found by Cell <i>oni</i>!

209
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,090
We've come to put down Cell.

210
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,260
–Eh? Really <i>oni</i>?
–Eh? Really <i>oni</i>?

211
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,180
Well? You've learned well who it
is you should be following, right?

212
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,570
Who's the boss of this place?

213
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,160
I can't hear you!

214
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
C-Cell...!

215
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,460
You mean Cell-<i>sama</i>, don't you?

216
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,290
<i>Oni</i>!

217
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,340
You guys! You still plan on
misbehaving here in Hell?!

218
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,140
Son Goku!

219
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,930
You ain't repented one bit, have you?

220
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:39,190
This is terrific. It appears
that you have died, too.

221
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,940
I'm glad to see you again.

222
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,530
Men of the Special Corps...?

223
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,730
Yes, sir!

224
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,200
Paikuhan!

225
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,310
W-What?!

226
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,930
W-When did Goku get so–?!

227
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,270
Do not panic!

228
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,860
That was nothing. I did kill him, after all.

229
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,440
I-I should have known,
Cell-<i>san</i>. If you would be so kind...

230
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,000
What the...

231
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,330
What?!

232
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,850
Impossible!

233
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,440
<i>Paikuhan...!</i>

234
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,350
<i>W-What speed!</i>

235
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,490
D-Damn!

236
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,070
To just get trounced like
this, and not be able to die...

237
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,990
It's like being in Hell.

238
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,170
They shouldn't be causing
any more mischief now.

239
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:08,210
Yeah, I doubt it.

240
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:13,970
<i>Awesome. To think that there'd</i>
<i>be someone as awesome as this...!</i>

241
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,100
<i>The Next World is going to be pretty exciting!</i>

242
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:22,100
<i>There were masters in the Next</i>
<i>World that were even better than Goku.</i>

243
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,770
<i>Goku's chest swelled greatly with anticipation.</i>

244
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,420
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

245
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:54,260
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

246
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,630
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

247
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:05,140
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

248
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,650
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

249
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:15,740
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

250
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,240
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

251
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,910
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

252
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,420
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

253
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,510
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

254
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,300
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

255
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,350
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

256
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,020
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

257
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,190
<i>So sorry.</i>

258
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:52,310
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

259
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,320
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

260
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,630
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

261
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,470
<i>Kaio-sama, if I win the Anoyoichi Tournament,</i>

262
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,720
<i>the Grand Kaio will train me, right?</i>

263
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:23,060
<i>Yeah. But Goku, everyone</i>
<i>who enters this tournament</i>

264
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,980
<i>is going to be like Paikuhan.</i>

265
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,940
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

266
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,860
<i>"I'm the Best in the Next World!!</i>
<i>Heroes of the Ages Assembled."</i>

267
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,190
<i>How nice. I wish I could enter, too.</i>

268
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,990
"Next time"
"I'm the Best in the Next World!!
Heroes of the Ages Assembled"
