3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,000
<i>In order to combine with No. 17</i>
<i>and No. 18 to become his perfect form,</i>

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,030
<i>the terrifying Artificial Human</i>
<i>Cell has come from the future!</i>

18
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,220
<i>During all this, Trunks</i>
<i>and Kuririn discover the plans</i>

19
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,690
<i>for No. 17 in Doctor Gero's laboratory.</i>

20
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,130
I-If I have Mom look at these,

21
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,830
she just might be able to
catch on to a weakness in No. 17!

22
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:48,120
<i>However, even as they are doing this,</i>

23
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,990
<i>Cell continues his cruelty</i>
<i>and slaughter over and over,</i>

24
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,830
<i>steadily storing up life energy for himself.</i>

25
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,110
<i>"Goku Awakens to Battle!</i>
<i>Go Beyond Super Saiyan!!"</i>

26
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,610
Right! One-two, one-two...

27
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,250
One-two, one-two...

28
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,440
Hello? What's the matter? Hello?

29
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,410
And so, as we continue, we relay
this report from a different city.

30
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,350
Following the incidents of the
Metro West suburb of Gingertown,

31
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:04,020
the citizens here in Nickytown
have also suddenly disappeared.

32
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,430
There is only one person who can be
thought of as the perpetrator here...

33
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,030
That devilish being with the power to
annihilate the Metro West Armed Forces,

34
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:16,470
and then turn this city into
a ghost town in an instant!

35
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,830
Just how long will this terror continue?

36
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,700
Where is he now, and what is he doing?

37
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,830
Investigators are combing the city,

38
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,670
but have not as yet located his whereabouts.

39
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,240
This has been a report from the scene.

40
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,410
Right. That was a live relay from Nickytown.

41
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,820
At the present time, this
calamity seems likely to continue.

42
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,290
We urge everyone to please be cautious.

43
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,660
Be cautious? That's a good joke!

44
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,820
Sense anything?

45
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,330
No! I'm sure I felt his <i>ki</i> a moment ago, though.

46
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,460
Damn!

47
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,670
We have to make sure he doesn't
become his perfect form no matter what!

48
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,260
Sis!

49
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,410
Kuririn, huh?

50
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,080
How nice of you to find me here!

51
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,860
I can't have you taking stabs at these people!

52
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,250
<i>Here I am taking a shortcut</i>
<i>back to the Kame House,</i>

53
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,820
<i>and I have to run into this terrible guy!</i>

54
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Uh, ahem...

55
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,430
Thank you very much.

56
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,430
N-Never mind, hurry and run away!

57
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,270
–Right!
–Thanks!

58
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,740
Suits me just fine.

59
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,050
Why don't I just have your life energy first?

60
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,060
Hurry and get in!

61
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,680
I'm taking off!

62
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,820
<i>It pains me to say it, but</i>
<i>he's not an opponent I can beat!</i>

63
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,230
<i>In this situation...</i>

64
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,240
<i>Taiyo-ken</i>!!

65
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,260
We did it!

66
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,100
Where is he? Where'd he go?!

67
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,640
Oh, hell!

68
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,760
Mister!

69
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,080
This would seem to be the end, wouldn't it?

70
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,660
Kuririn!

71
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,270
It's those guys.

72
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,750
He's hidden his <i>ki</i> once again!

73
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,750
Are you all right, Kuririn?

74
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,230
I'm saved!

75
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,290
Oh, Son Goku is still alive?

76
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,860
Of course he is!

77
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,660
<i>It appears things are starting</i>
<i>to turn out slightly different</i>

78
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,330
<i>from the history I know.</i>

79
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,710
<i>History is starting to turn out differently...</i>

80
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,340
<i>Evidently, ever since I came</i>
<i>here in the time machine,</i>

81
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,150
<i>things have been changing in subtle ways.</i>

82
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,520
<i>At the time,</i>

83
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,790
<i>I thought that if only</i>
<i>Goku-san hadn't died of his illness,</i>

84
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,360
<i>and instead lived,</i>

85
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:02,700
<i>he could save us from a</i>
<i>future wrought with devastation</i>

86
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,710
<i>by the Artificial Humans.</i>

87
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,320
<i>However, when I came</i>
<i>once again three years later,</i>

88
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,730
<i>Goku-san and the others were fighting</i>
<i>against different Artificial Humans...</i>

89
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:07,130
<i>Artificial Human No. 16, whom</i>
<i>I had never seen before, appears,</i>

90
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:13,140
<i>and then, this guy Cell or whatever also appears.</i>

91
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,890
<i>On top of that, the time</i>
<i>machine he came back in...</i>

92
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,690
<i>It was definitely my own.</i>

93
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,510
<i>Does that mean that Cell</i>
<i>coming here four years ago</i>

94
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,910
<i>was my future self's fault,</i>
<i>in that other dimension?</i>

95
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,920
<i>By coming here from the future,</i>
<i>with the changes to history,</i>

96
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,790
<i>have I instead plunged</i>
<i>this world into a crisis?</i>

97
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:13,360
I will go beyond, count on it!
Beyond even Super Saiyan!

98
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,700
<i>Dad...</i>

99
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,700
<i>Mom, I'm going to go try to train with Dad.</i>

100
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,480
If Dad can overcome Super Saiyan, why not me?

101
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:29,720
Mom...

102
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,060
Dammit! Has he gotten away again?!

103
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,790
If he's able to search out our <i>ki</i> and
escape every which way from us this well,

104
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,740
we have absolutely no way to strike at him!

105
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,890
<i>If I keep taking life essences at this pace,</i>

106
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:16,890
<i>then the time when I absorb No. 17 and No. 18</i>

107
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,560
<i>and become my perfect form is not far off.</i>

108
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,710
Come on!

109
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,780
Aren't there any decent roads?

110
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,160
Hmph, isn't this more fun?

111
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,230
No. 16, aren't we at Son Goku's house yet?

112
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,900
Yeah. It's right nearby.

113
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,300
Indeed! How nice for you two to be so carefree.

114
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,740
Won't it be easier if I do this?

115
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:29,300
See? I feel much better.

116
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,100
Aw, how could you do such a thing?

117
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,900
This isn't any fun at all, is it?

118
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,440
You know, you really are strange.

119
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,540
There's quite a bit of humanness left in you.

120
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,480
<i>And so, two days pass,</i>
<i>and while a third was passing...</i>

121
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,920
This time, the monster has
appeared in the southern zone,

122
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,790
in a large city in Sector 48.

123
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,090
We have also had reports

124
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,700
that over half the inhabitants
have been killed already.

125
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,300
Damn!

126
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,300
Now it's the southern zone?

127
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,910
They said there were already a good
deal of casualties in the Metro West area.

128
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,140
I know!

129
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,420
Gohan! Be careful!

130
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,690
If we come up on him like this,
Cell won't be aware of our <i>ki</i>!

131
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,320
This time, we've got him for sure!

132
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,690
Let's defeat him before he
combines with No. 17 and the others,

133
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,730
and becomes his perfect form!

134
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,330
Yeah! The way we are now, we can do it!

135
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,670
That's right! Piccolo<i>-san</i> is here,

136
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,300
and he's merged with Kami<i>-sama</i>
and gotten incredibly strong!

137
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,310
Cell is a crafty one.

138
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,710
Even if we do get close,

139
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,550
if he hides on us, there'll be no way to find him.

140
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,730
W-What's that?!

141
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,740
Have the Artificial Humans come attackin'?!

142
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,200
"Yaaaa!" is uncalled for, there's no "Yaaaa!"

143
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,370
Here you are pouring water over people–

144
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,880
It's been a long time since
I've had the pleasure of a gal!

145
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,320
Then again, it might be a little bit
difficult to still call you a gal, huh?

146
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:37,320
I should've expected as much from
a former martial artist. Well done!

147
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,800
Ah, Goku<i>-sa</i>!

148
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:47,140
Goku<i>-sa</i>?! Huh?

149
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,580
Goku<i>-sa</i>?

150
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,160
What's wrong?

151
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,700
–Goku<i>-sa</i>!
–Goku!

152
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,710
Well, me too!

153
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,850
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

154
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,560
Chichi!

155
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,860
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

156
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,500
Sorry to make you worry so!

157
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,100
Looks like I'm completely over my illness!

158
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,100
Are you really okay?

159
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,540
Yeah! See for yourself!

160
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,840
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

161
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,720
Hey, cut it out!

162
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,720
I inadvertently put too much power into that!

163
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,820
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

164
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,660
Sorry, sorry!

165
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,830
Goku!

166
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,230
Old-timer!

167
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,230
You've recovered from your illness?

168
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,230
Yeah, I'm all right now!

169
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,500
I heard what everyone has
been saying in my dreams.

170
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,810
I pretty much know what's going on.

171
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,640
Looks as though things
have gotten awful again, huh?

172
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,810
Goku, don't tell me you're already...

173
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,710
You gotta be kiddin'!

174
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,020
You're thinkin' of fightin' already? You'll die!

175
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,320
Don't worry, I ain't fighting yet.

176
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,220
If Vegeta can't win against
them now, I can't win either.

177
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,720
That's why I'm thinking of
aiming for something higher, too.

178
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,570
Higher?

179
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,720
Higher than Super Saiyan.

180
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,720
<i>Son Goku has finally recovered.</i>

181
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,130
<i>However, is it really possible</i>
<i>to go beyond Super Saiyan?</i>

182
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

183
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

184
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

185
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

186
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

187
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

188
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

189
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

190
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

191
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

192
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

193
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

194
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

195
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

196
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

197
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

198
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,170
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

199
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,540
<i>I'm gonna take Gohan and go somewhere–</i>

200
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,670
<i>a place where you do a year's</i>
<i>worth of training in one day.</i>

201
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,010
<i>Vegeta, you guys do it, too!</i>

202
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,610
<i>Hurry and get going, Goku!</i>

203
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,510
<i>If Cell achieves his perfect form,</i>
<i>it will be too late for anything!</i>

204
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,520
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

205
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,190
<i>"Hasten Your Training, Saiyans!</i>
<i>In the Room of Spirit and Time..."</i>

206
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,230
<i>All right, I'm going to</i>
<i>surpass Super Saiyan, too!</i>

207
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,060
"Next time"
"Hasten Your Training, Saiyans!
In the Room of Spirit and Time..."
