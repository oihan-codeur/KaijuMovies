<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,780

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:33,310
<i>Dammit, three years from</i>

17
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,920

22
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,760
<i>How can Vegeta suddenly start</i>
<i>training himself under 300-times gravity?</i>

23
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,450
This is pretty severe.

24
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,220
At this very moment,

25
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,460
those terrible monsters
might be being born somewhere.

26
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,830
Just the thought of it
is keeping me on edge.

27
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,500
Bulma<i>-chan</i>! Bulma<i>-chan</i>!

28
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,740
I've discovered a new cake store.

29
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,250
Look! Aren't they pretty?

30
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,810
Well? Don't they look yummy?

31
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,780
How nice for you, Mama,
not to have any worries.

32
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,150
Bulma<i>-chan,</i>

33
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:29,750
lately you've been upset because
Yamucha<i>-chan</i> and Vegeta<i>-chan...</i>

34
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,220
...are too occupied with their training...

35
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,430
...to be able to pay you any attention, huh?

36
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,770
Of course not! Don't make me laugh.

37
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,760
Boy, that Vegeta is one guy
who sure likes to do crazy things.

38
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,440
Not only is he crazy to be
training under 300g of gravity,

39
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,450
but he keeps ordering
new gadgets to train with,

40
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,110
and then breaks them right away.

41
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,780
He's got an aberrant fanaticism for battle.

42
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,790
Dear, no! Vegeta<i>-chan</i> is quite sharp!

43
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,950
Mama!

44
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,420
You've said before you liked Son<i>-kun,</i>
but now you're saying Vegeta?

45
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,100
My, my, Goku<i>-chan</i> is sharp too!

46
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,860
But Vegeta<i>-chan</i> has this well-moderated,

47
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,730
stoic sense about him that I can't pass up.

48
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,770
Not to mention that wide forehead
of his is so individualistic and cute!

49
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,110
I know! Some time your Mama
will have to take him out on a date!

50
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,270
It's no wonder this would happen,

51
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,440
not with his dangerous mode of training.

52
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,780
Vegeta?

53
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,150
He couldn't have...

54
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,810
You're alive?

55
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,340
Of course I am!

56
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,420
What do you think you were doing?!

57
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,450
You came this close to wrecking my house!

58
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,760
Vegeta!

59
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,240
Y-You mind your own business,
bothersome human slave!

60
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,240
How is this training?

61
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,570
You can't do anything
in the shape you're in!

62
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,250
Injuries such as these are nothing!

63
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:43,920
I'm the number one Saiyan in the universe.

64
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,750
Y-You'll see how I overcome Kakarrot in no time!

65
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,920
Right, right.

66
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,420
Vegetables, carrots,
whatever, it doesn't matter.

67
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,130
Just do what I tell you now.

68
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,790
Don't you tell me what to...

69
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,970
Vegeta!

70
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,830
<i>Masenko</i>!

71
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,050
Father...

72
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,930
There!

73
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,150
What's wrong, Gohan?
Your motions are too slow!

74
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,280
To get off like he did
after such a major accident?

75
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,810
I'd have to say it's a miracle.

76
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,790
These Saiyans really are something!

77
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,820
Poor Vegeta<i>-chan</i>!

78
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,500
Kakarrot...

79
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,980
I-I will surpass you...
I will surpass you! Count on it!

80
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:42,150
Kakarrot!

81
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,850
Y-You're...

82
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,800
Why?

83
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,410
Why? Why is it I can't reach them?!

84
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,420
<i>Why</i>?!

85
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,320
<i>Why is it?</i>

86
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,990
<i>You are to become the king of the Saiyans,</i>

87
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,160
<i>the greatest fighting race in the universe.</i>

88
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,440
As soon as we Saiyans are born,
our abilities as warriors are investigated.

89
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,750
The ones with the lower readings

90
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,780
are sent off to planets where
they will not face great opponents.

91
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,160
Those good-for-nothings!

92
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,790
But you, Prince, your abilities
were the highest of anyone's,

93
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,800
that of a super-elite Saiyan!

94
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,470
You are certain to become the
greatest Saiyan in the universe!

95
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:14,170
In fact, you may even become
a legendary Super Saiyan!

96
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,480
<i>He's right. I am super-elite.</i>

97
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,180
<i>There's no reason I should be beneath</i>
<i>lower class warriors like Kakarrot!</i>

98
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,430
I am the greatest Saiyan in the universe!

99
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:41,460
Pu-erh, we're going on a training journey.

100
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,330
Okay!

101
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,100
Hold on, Vegeta!

102
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,480
Do you think you're in any
shape to be over-exerting yourself?!

103
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,820
You keep that up, and those
injuries we're treating will never heal!

104
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,420
Carping vermin. You really are a vulgar woman.

105
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,800
Oh, look at that.

106
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,330
I'll tell you flat-out, you're not
the type who's going to live that long.

107
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,100
You can't refute that, can you?

108
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:31,010
I don't suppose you can,
since what I'm saying is the truth.

109
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,650
Do you want to die in three years?

110
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,920
O-Of course I'd rather live.

111
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,090
After all, I'm still a well-built,
young, beautiful lady, you know.

112
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,660
In that case, shut up!

113
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,450
<i>Three years remain until the</i>

136
