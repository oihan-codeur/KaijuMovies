<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:30,245
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:36,005
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:41,635
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:48,885
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:54,645
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:57,235
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,275 --> 00:01:00,155
<i>The sky is clear</i>

00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:02,985
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:05,575
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:08,575
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:11,575
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,595
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:28,595
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,935
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:34,145
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:36,975
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,775
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

23
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:57,665
<i>Under manipulation by Madoshi Babidi's</i>
<i>magic, Vegeta returns as an evil warrior.</i>

24
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:01,835
This fight is between me and Kakarrot!

25
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:05,135
It does not matter to me what
happens with Majin Boo or anything else!

26
00:02:05,175 --> 00:02:09,595
Babidi! Change us to a place
where no one else is around!

27
00:02:09,635 --> 00:02:13,185
I have decided to fight Vegeta!

28
00:02:13,225 --> 00:02:15,725
Papparapa!

29
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:25,655
<i>At last, Goku and Vegeta's</i>
<i>unprecedented, fierce battle had begun!</i>

30
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:35,415
<i>Elsewhere, Kaioshin and Gohan</i>
<i>have arrived in front of Majin Boo's ball.</i>

31
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:42,625
<i>Incredible. This is an enormous, evil ki,</i>
<i>the likes of which I've never felt until now.</i>

32
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:45,045
I welcome you here.

33
00:02:46,505 --> 00:02:51,715
<i>"The Seal is Broken!</i>
<i>Out Comes the Vicious Majin Boo!!"</i>

34
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:25,675
Gohan-<i>san</i>, no matter what,
we have to put them away

35
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:28,675
before the energy
accumulates in Majin Boo's ball.

36
00:03:28,715 --> 00:03:34,725
If Majin Boo is revived, this
Earth will be destroyed in a flash!

37
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:36,225
Right.

38
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,895
Kaioshin!

39
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:42,935
Shall we go up to the surface?

40
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:48,865
Majin Boo is just about to emerge from
this sphere, having reached full power.

41
00:03:48,905 --> 00:03:50,865
When he does, it will
be with devastating force,

42
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:54,955
and it won't do for me to
have my spaceship destroyed.

43
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:58,705
Fine. But no matter what may
come, we are going to beat you,

44
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:01,625
and stop Majin Boo's revival!

45
00:04:02,835 --> 00:04:06,585
You think it will be that easy?

46
00:04:09,675 --> 00:04:11,925
Papparapa!

47
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,945
Well, Dabura?

48
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:35,655
Just to be sure, let me ask you if you're
certain you can beat that Earthling.

49
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:39,825
Of course! I fought him
for a bit earlier, after all.

50
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:43,375
That scum! I can
undoubtedly take care of him.

51
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:53,175
Do whatever you like with him!
You may turn him to stone like those others,

52
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:56,175
or mess him up even worse if you like!

53
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:58,135
Right!

54
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:26,545
You've gotten strong, Kakarrot!

55
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,965
This is the result of your
training in the Other World?

56
00:05:32,005 --> 00:05:36,675
You too, Vegeta! You're much
stronger than I'd thought!

57
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:56,485
Kaioshin, I'm so happy you came!

58
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:59,445
Now I can finally take revenge, you see!

59
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:07,915
Long ago, you killed my papa.
Surely, he must have been careless.

60
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:13,585
But I'm not going to be killed by
the likes of you, the way Papa was.

61
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:17,595
I have entirely greater
magical power than Papa did.

62
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:20,555
Dabura is here too, after all.

63
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:34,695
He's got it all covered.

64
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:38,155
If I'm not careful as I attack,
I'll be done in by his magic!

65
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:46,625
Damn! To think I had a
hard time with this guy...

66
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:50,955
While we're here like this, Majin
Boo is rapidly collecting energy!

67
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:54,125
Get angry! Get angry, Gohan!

68
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,965
F-Father!

69
00:06:56,005 --> 00:06:59,255
Get angry, remember what
happened when you fought Cell,

70
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:02,555
and call up all the power you possess!

71
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:07,055
If you do, you can't lose to any
kind of guy in the whole world!

72
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,515
Any kind of guy, you hear?

73
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:16,615
I am angry! I am angry, but I can't
bring myself to the way it was then...

74
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:19,525
the way it was when I fought Cell...

75
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:29,165
<i>Ka... me... ha... me...</i>

76
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:31,125
<i>Ha</i>!!

77
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,325
Dammit!

78
00:08:13,585 --> 00:08:15,505
<i>I'll just have to do it now!</i>

79
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:08,055
I-It can't be...!

80
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:14,055
It can't be! Not this soon!

81
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:26,485
What is it?

82
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:38,085
What is the matter, Babidi-<i>sama</i>?

83
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:46,965
F-Full... Full power! He's at full power!

84
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:53,475
Majin Boo is at full power!!

85
00:09:53,515 --> 00:09:59,275
He's at full power! He's at full power!

86
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:06,525
Majin Boo is finally revived!

87
00:10:13,165 --> 00:10:16,585
I-Impossible! Why has
Goku-<i>san</i>'s damage energy

88
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,495
collected as suddenly as this?

89
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,505
Th-That's why!

90
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:29,975
Father is fighting at a level
even beyond Super Saiyan!

91
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:33,935
Perhaps, as his and Vegeta-<i>san</i>'s
two incredible powers collide,

92
00:10:33,975 --> 00:10:36,935
the damage done is also extraordinary!

93
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:38,145
Ah, dammit!

94
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:40,985
We did it, Dabura!

95
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:43,195
Yes, Babidi-<i>sama.</i>

96
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:49,285
H-How can this be? How can this
come out in the worst possible way?!

97
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:52,575
I've completely misjudged things!

98
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:12,265
Die!

99
00:11:30,575 --> 00:11:32,945
What's the matter, Kakarrot?

100
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:48,505
There you are!

101
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:52,515
Die, Kakarrot!

102
00:11:52,555 --> 00:11:54,555
Not bad, Vegeta!

103
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:03,315
I'm starting to burn now, too!

104
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:29,795
Mister Satan, congratulations on your victory!

105
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:34,765
This time there were a number of
accidents, and it must have been tough.

106
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:39,305
Well, it's always difficult
to win through to the end.

107
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:43,775
It's he who can overcome and be
victorious that is the true world champion!

108
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:47,855
That's true, isn't it? It looked
as if you had an especially

109
00:12:47,895 --> 00:12:50,735
difficult battle in the
final match against No. 18.

110
00:12:57,655 --> 00:13:00,165
That's why amateurs are so troubling.

111
00:13:00,205 --> 00:13:04,125
Actually, if I'd wanted to defeat her,
five seconds would have been plenty.

112
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:06,715
My opponent being a girl, and all...

113
00:13:06,755 --> 00:13:09,715
But it would have been
inexcusable to my many fans,

114
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:13,555
who came to see my strength,
if I'd ended it so readily.

115
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:16,515
That's why I intentionally drew things out.

116
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:21,555
Wow! You think that much about the fans?

117
00:13:21,595 --> 00:13:24,765
This is precisely why you're
the true champion, isn't it?

118
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:28,815
That's right, that's right.

119
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:33,235
You're pretty sharp, aren't you?
You'll be a fine reporter!

120
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:39,205
Er, could you once again tell us the
technique that clinched the final match?

121
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:43,835
Eh, um, Satan Miracle Very Wonderful...

122
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,745
...Special Strong Bari-bari...

123
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:48,585
...Punch, I believe it was!

124
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:52,545
Ah, I have a feeling that is
a little bit different from before...

125
00:13:52,585 --> 00:13:55,095
R-Really?

126
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:58,515
<i>I-I don't even remember it myself!</i>

127
00:13:58,555 --> 00:14:03,105
Moving along, what can you tell us about
that group that attacked the grounds?

128
00:14:03,145 --> 00:14:09,185
I'm sure they must have come thinking
to challenge me, the World Champion.

129
00:14:09,225 --> 00:14:14,565
There's a lot of those kind, who come to
challenge me using their bluffs and tricks.

130
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:18,745
However, once they saw my no-nonsense
attitude, they became afraid and ran off.

131
00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:20,655
So that's it!

132
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:30,125
Let me take this occasion to say to all
the martial arts combatants in the world,

133
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:35,795
Mister Satan will accept
any challenge from anyone!

134
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:38,765
Bring it on, fair and square!

135
00:14:38,805 --> 00:14:40,725
Way to go, Mister Satan!

136
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:43,145
Mister Satan, you're so cool!

137
00:14:43,185 --> 00:14:48,435
Satan...! Satan...! Satan...!

138
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:56,775
<i>S-She doesn't have to look at me</i>
<i>with that frightening look in her eye!</i>

139
00:14:56,815 --> 00:14:59,695
<i>I'm going to promptly</i>
<i>pay her the money, after all!</i>

140
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:14,675
There's been this wild,
incredible <i>ki</i> for a little while now.

141
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,505
Who is it? Our Papas?

142
00:15:16,545 --> 00:15:18,675
I don't know. I felt it a little while back

143
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:21,095
from the direction of the tournament!

144
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:26,145
Why is it we're feeling such an
incredible <i>ki</i> going back and forth?

145
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:29,515
Could it be that fights are
occurring all over the world?

146
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:32,775
I have utterly no idea what's going on.

147
00:15:32,815 --> 00:15:35,155
Should we give up going, and head back?

148
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:39,775
No, no way! I want to see Majin Boo!
I absolutely want to see him!

149
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:45,615
All right, Goten! Okay! Let's go
look toward where the biggest <i>ki</i> is!

150
00:15:45,655 --> 00:15:46,665
Yeah!

151
00:16:10,555 --> 00:16:13,065
It's been a long time since I've gotten this wild!

152
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:17,395
Vegeta, no matter what
happens, I ain't losing to you!

153
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,425
Back at you!

154
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:08,535
You evaded that well, huh Kakarrot?

155
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:10,915
All that valuable power, and you still missed!

156
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:14,625
Hey, I'm just starting!

157
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:30,475
I-I can't believe it! I thought I had
trained considerably on the Other Side.

158
00:17:30,515 --> 00:17:32,895
And here we are, utterly even!

159
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:36,475
You must have trained even harder than I did!

160
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:41,105
That's not it! Though I suspect
I have trained harder than you did,

161
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:44,115
you have a talent for
going even higher than I do.

162
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:47,945
No matter how much time has passed,
that difference has not changed.

163
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,455
I knew it.

164
00:17:49,495 --> 00:17:55,875
When you fought that
monster Babidi sent you...

165
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:19,025
It was a shock, Kakarrot!

166
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:21,945
How could I, the prodigal prince of bloodshed,

167
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:25,945
forever be outdistanced
by you, a lower-class warrior?!

168
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,825
A-And so, I secretly made my resolution.

169
00:18:32,155 --> 00:18:35,955
So that's it! Babidi!

170
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:38,955
That's why you intentionally
fell under Babidi's spell!

171
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:42,175
Yeah! That's when I remembered about those

172
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:46,675
two men of Babidi's, back at the tournament.

173
00:19:05,905 --> 00:19:07,485
He's completely different from before!

174
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,775
It's like he's a different person, he's so strong!

175
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:19,915
Those who had known the men from before

176
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:23,795
spoke of how much stronger they had gotten.

177
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,845
I remembered it and began to think.

178
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:32,885
If I were to be controlled by him... Kakarrot,

179
00:19:32,925 --> 00:19:35,765
the gap between us might be closed...

180
00:19:38,895 --> 00:19:41,935
The result was just as I thought.

181
00:19:44,485 --> 00:19:47,525
It wasn't a very favorable mode, however.

182
00:19:47,565 --> 00:19:51,945
Vegeta, with your great pride,
you allowed yourself to be controlled

183
00:19:51,985 --> 00:19:54,825
by that guy just because you
wanted to become stronger?

184
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:59,415
I... I...

185
00:19:59,455 --> 00:20:05,795
I... wanted to return to the way I was long ago!

186
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,885
I wanted to return to the brutal,
cold-blooded Saiyan that I was,

187
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:13,975
so I could fight all-out with
you and not worry about anything!

188
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:16,975
I hated it!

189
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,895
I hated how, before I had realized it,

190
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:23,985
I had been influenced by
you guys and become so gentle!

191
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:29,445
I, of all people, had a family.

192
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:32,445
It wasn't an unpleasant feeling...

193
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:38,285
I came to like this comfortable Earth as well!

194
00:20:41,535 --> 00:20:43,585
That's why it was necessary for me

195
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:48,465
to be controlled by Babidi
and return to my evil self!

196
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:56,845
And thanks to that, I feel great now!

197
00:20:58,385 --> 00:21:00,805
Is that really so, Vegeta?

198
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:29,005
It is just about time, Babidi-<i>sama.</i>

199
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:32,885
Majin Boo's seal will be broken!

200
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:38,845
He's emerging! Majin Boo is emerging!

201
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:01,785
<i>The seal is at last broken!</i>

202
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:07,045
<i>Majin Boo is appearing!</i>

203
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:12,885
<i>And what about the conclusion</i>
<i>to Goku and Vegeta's fight?</i>

204
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:18,755
<i>Hurry, Goku! Something</i>
<i>terrible is happening to Earth!</i>

205
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:38,945
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

206
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:45,535
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

207
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:56,095
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

208
00:22:56,135 --> 00:23:02,225
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

209
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:09,185
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

210
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:14,565
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

211
00:23:15,235 --> 00:23:18,445
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

212
00:23:18,485 --> 00:23:27,535
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

213
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,085
<i>Even now?</i>

214
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:36,715
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

215
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:42,095
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

216
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:48,605
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

217
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:58,605
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

218
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:15,835
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

219
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:20,595
<i>Empty?! Hey, did you say</i>
<i>Majin Boo's egg was empty?</i>

220
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:24,175
<i>Too bad for you, Babidi.</i>
<i>Gohan-san's attack just now</i>

221
00:24:24,215 --> 00:24:27,055
<i>appears to have obliterated Majin Boo.</i>

222
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:29,015
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

223
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:32,185
<i>"I Won't Allow the Revival!!</i>
<i>A Kamehame-Ha of Resistance."</i>

224
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:36,275
<i>Ah! The smoke that came out</i>
<i>of the egg is taking human form!</i>

225
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:39,695
"Next time"
"I Won't Allow the Revival!!
A Kamehame-Ha of Resistance"
