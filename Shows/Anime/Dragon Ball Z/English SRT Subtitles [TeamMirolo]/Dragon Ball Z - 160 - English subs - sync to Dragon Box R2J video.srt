5

6

<i>Don't you disappoint me this time!</i>

22
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:21,975
What?

23
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:36,035
<i>I-I'm to blame for all of this.</i>

24
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,535
<i>It's all because I didn't destroy No. 18!</i>

<i>W-Why, you...!</i>

26
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:51,525
I won't... I won't let you do
with the future as you like!

27
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:52,125
To think that it could be this bad!

28
00:06:57,425 --> 00:07:02,555
M-Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>, at this rate,
the house is gonna be washed away!

29
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:05,725
We need to be runnin' away somewhere!

30
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,265
That's right!

31
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:11,895
What with Cell and Vegeta and
so on, we're getting caught up in...

32
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:14,945
...something terrific, aren't we?

33
00:07:15,945 --> 00:07:20,035
It's no use. This situation is
spread out over the entire Earth.

34
00:07:20,075 --> 00:07:22,535
No matter where we go, it would be the same.

35
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,745
The Earth will be wrecked!

36
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:37,355
Are you finally done?

37
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,885
The trembling of the
atmosphere has finally died down.

38
00:09:01,925 --> 00:09:05,055
We survived then, huh?

39
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:07,055
No.

40
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:10,185
This is where it begins.

41
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,105
Muten Roshi-<i>sama...</i>

42
00:09:16,105 --> 00:09:19,185
The real terror, that is.

43
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:31,035
Cell has become his perfect form.

44
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:41,885
How is that? Did Kuririn
not use the controller I made?

45
00:09:41,925 --> 00:09:45,925
Kuririn himself stomped the controller.

46
00:09:48,095 --> 00:09:49,725
Why?!

47
00:09:53,265 --> 00:09:56,935
Miserable Vegeta! Take responsibility!

48
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:44,505
Are you okay, Gohan?

49
00:12:01,105 --> 00:12:02,435
Gohan?

50
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:29,375
Piccolo-<i>san</i> said long ago that you
would be unsuitable as a teacher, Father!

51
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:34,635
That you were too gentle, Father!

52
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:38,225
That you were utterly lacking...

53
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:42,065
...in the harshness it takes to do this!

54
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:46,235
That just by seeing how
coddled I was, he could tell!

55
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:47,735
Gohan!

56
00:12:51,065 --> 00:12:53,115
I finally understand that!

57
00:13:02,075 --> 00:13:05,955
I have always been spoiled
by your gentleness, Father!

58
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:18,265
Father, please treat this
like you are trying to kill me!

59
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:23,895
Then, even supposing I really do die,

60
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:26,315
that will have been all I was capable of!

61
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:31,235
And if that is my level,

62
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:36,115
there's no way I could surpass you, Father!

63
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:09,725
If I won't bring myself to die...

64
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:17,655
...there's no way I can obtain real strength.

65
00:14:17,695 --> 00:14:22,325
I can't ever become a Super Saiyan!

66
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:40,635
<i>Ka... me... ha... me...</i>

67
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:42,225
<i>Ha!!</i>

68
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:58,865
<i>Damned if I'm running from this!</i>

69
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:14,215
<i>I-I've been a pampered child...</i>

70
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:20,715
<i>There was the time...</i>

71
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:28,055
Gohan! Now! Shoot!

72
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:46,495
<i>Then there was the time...</i>

73
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:08,685
<i>Then there was the time...</i>

74
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:56,275
<i>It was my fault for being weak.</i>

75
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,145
<i>It was because I depended on everyone else...</i>

76
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,695
You've finally become a Super Saiyan!

77
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:48,245
Just like that.

78
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:51,535
Now, you have to control
your excitement in that state.

79
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:19,065
You did good, Gohan!

80
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:23,235
Sorry, Father. It's so hard!

81
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:27,695
Hey, you just have to
take it a little at a time.

82
00:18:27,735 --> 00:18:29,695
Let's take a short break.

83
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:33,115
Should I cut your hair? It's getting too long!

84
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,295
I knew it. Even if it is his perfect form,

85
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:23,255
it doesn't appear to be anything special.

86
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,125
He's shrunk, compared to how he was before.

87
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,315
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

88
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:00,705
<i>T-This can't be...!</i>

89
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,895
<i>So this is my perfect form?</i>

90
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:23,225
<i>This is my body, perfect in every way?</i>

91
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:27,275
<i>Splendid! I've finally obtained it!</i>

92
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:49,465
Very good! Those are
wonderful attacks, you guys!

93
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:55,215
Move away, Trunks!

94
00:20:56,925 --> 00:20:59,055
Don't you move, Cell!

95
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:03,475
<i>Kienzan</i>!!

96
00:21:09,445 --> 00:21:12,105
G-G-Got him!

97
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,045
<i>I-It can't be!</i>

98
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,755
<i>That was the Kienzan that</i>
<i>cut through even Freeza...!</i>

99
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:14,295
<i>Tremendous power and speed!</i>

100
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:18,465
<i>Is this the true ability of</i>
<i>the perfected form of Cell?</i>

101
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,515
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!!

102
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:47,545
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

103
00:22:47,585 --> 00:22:53,375
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

104
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,755
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

105
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:04,265
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

106
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:10,775
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

107

110

<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

111
00:23:30,795 --> 00:23:32,625
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

112
00:23:32,665 --> 00:23:34,425
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

113
00:23:34,465 --> 00:23:38,465
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

114
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:44,135
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

115
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:46,305
