<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:52,300
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:04,820
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,290
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,910
<i>Facing the persistent attack of Vegeta,</i>
<i>who had transformed into a Great Ape,</i>

17
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,310
<i>Goku was near death.</i>

18
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,780
<i>However, he was unexpectedly saved by Yajirobe.</i>

19
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,920
<i>Still, the damage to his whole body was severe,</i>

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,520
<i>and he faced his greatest pinch.</i>

21
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,240
<i>The only means left to them was the Genki Dama.</i>

22
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,150
<i>Goku entrusted the ki he had</i>

<i>"Shoot, Kuririn!</i>
<i>The Genki Dama, Packed with Hope."</i>

24
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:59,100
Stay with it, Kuririn...
Gohan can't control this <i>ki...</i>

25
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,000
T-T-There it is! Is this–?

26
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,570
A <i>Genki Dama...</i> You did it...

27
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:20,210
Hit him... with that...

28
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,590
I can't make another <i>Genki Dama...</i>
Make sure you hit him... please!

29
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,360
Y-You got it! I'll try. Let me take care of it.

30
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,120
He's so strong! He should be fairly
worn out from fighting with Father, too...

31
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,340
<i>You're a tough little runt, but</i>
<i>you appear to be nearing your limit.</i>

32
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,210
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, fight!

33
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,160
Fight, Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

34
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,220
W-W-What are you sayin', Chichi?!
Gohan's no match for that guy!

35
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:40,530
Gohan, get out of there!

36
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,230
<i>Gohan-chan...</i>

37
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,760
Chichi, are you–?

38
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,970
Pa!

39
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,140
Chichi...

40
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,720
They've vanished!

41
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,120
Gohan<i>-chan</i>?

42
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,530
Uranai Baba, hurry up and show me Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

43
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:25,800
A-All right! All right! I'll try! Let me go!

44
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,180
You've got a ridiculous
amount of strength for a woman!

45
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,930
<i>Kamehame-Ha!</i>

46
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,110
Is that your last-ditch effort?!

47
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,740
Darn it!

48
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,180
One more!

49
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,300
Damn! With my skill, I can't hit
him when he's moving around like that!

50
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,910
You don't hit him with the
<i>Genki Dama</i> by using your eyes.

51
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,580
You sense out his evil <i>ki</i> and shoot at that.

52
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,310
W-Who's there?!

53
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,850
I am Kaio, the one who
taught Son Goku the <i>Genki Dama.</i>

54
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,290
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

55
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:54,730
Everything will be decided by your one shot.

56
00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,330
Know that the ball of that <i>Genki Dama</i>
is filled with the hopes of the whole earth.

57
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,770
The ball is filled with the
hopes of the whole earth?

58
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:21,660
No matter how many of you scum gang
up on me, you're still no match for an elite.

59
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,770
It looks like once you
realized that, it was already too late.

60
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:41,240
S-Sense out his evil <i>ki</i>
and shoot at that... So that's it...

61
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,410
Kuririn, we're counting on you!

62
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,180
You'll only get one chance.

63
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,960
I'm done playing around.

64
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
You think you can get away?!

65
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,170
<i>F-Feel it! Feel his evil ki!</i>

66
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,350
<i>K-Kuririn!</i>

67
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,730
<i>H-He's fixin' to do somethin'.</i>
<i>That's a humungous amount of ki.</i>

68
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,360
<i>If you're gonna get him, then get him, already!</i>

69
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,120
Watch closely, Kakarrot!
This is the end of your foolish son!

70
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,720
I've got him!

71
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,290
What're ya doin', ya dimwit?!
Hurry up and hit him with that!

72
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,300
<i>W-What?</i>

73
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,730
T-That idiot!

74
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,170
Damn it all!

75
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,170
W-What is that?!

76
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,310
Hit him!

77
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,320
It missed!

78
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:19,730
W-What happened?!
How could my crystal ball crack?!

79
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,140
G-Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

80
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,710
It's hopeless now!

81
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,550
Bounce it back, Gohan!

82
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,290
Gohan, that thing is on our side!

83
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,160
As long as you don't have any evil in you,
you should be able to bounce it back!

84
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,810
You did it!

85
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,770
Yahoo!

86
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,880
We did it! We did it!

87
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,820
We did it, Goku!

88
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,900
Turtle, do you have any quick-drying glue?

89
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,470
Glue? Hmm, I seem to remember
having some around here somewhere...

90
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,180
What about Gohan<i>-chan</i>?!

91
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,580
Uranai Baba, can't you do
something about the crystal ball?!

92
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,420
Chichi! Stop that!

93
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,190
Pa! Gohan<i>-chan</i> is still alive! So's Goku<i>-sa</i>!

94
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:03,460
Y-You're right. But how are we
goin' to get to where Goku and them are?

95
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,630
All right, Chichi<i>-san</i>, I'll take you there.

96
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:12,800
Really? But how?

97
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
In my airship.

98
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,640
Bulma<i>-san</i>, thank you!

99
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,710
If I were to ever have a husband
and son who were in trouble,

100
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,520
I would rush to their side, no
matter what. That's human nature.

101
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,050
All right, I'm going too.

102
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,920
I'm going, too.

103
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,360
K-Karin<i>-sama</i>!

104
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,860
Father...

105
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:11,260
You guys finally got him, huh?

106
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,070
Time and again, I thought we were done for.

107
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,900
You two sure are a mess.

108
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,880
We're not as bad off as you.

109
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,900
T-The Saiyan!

110
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,260
It's okay. He's dead.

111
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,010
We can relax, now.

112
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:06,020
Damn it all, he was one horrible
fellow, but we could at least dig a grave.

113
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,820
You mean, a grave for you guys?

114
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:32,040
T-T-That's impossible!
He took that <i>Genki Dama</i> dead-on!

115
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,920
You put me through quite
an awful experience, huh?

116
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,020
E-Even I thought I was
going to die from that one.

117
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:52,630
I may have taken quite a bit of damage,

118
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,230
but I still have enough
power left to take care of you trash.

119
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,640
After I've killed you,

120
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,050
I'll wait until I've recovered my strength,
and then thoroughly destroy this planet!

121
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,810
Just keep on going straight.

122
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,980
Bulma! For Karin<i>-sama</i> to
deign to give you directions...

123
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,390
...is an <i>extremely</i>
magnanimous thing for him to do!

124
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,860
It is? He looks like an ordinary cat to me.

125
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:22,890
Y-You guys dare to make me,
Vegeta<i>-sama</i>, use up nearly all of my power?

126
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,530
Never mind that you ganged up on me,
against trash like you, it wounds my pride...

127
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:38,270
Would you die already?!

128
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:47,080
D-Dammit... Dammit!

129
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,250
G-Goku!

130
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,420
Damn it! Coming from me,
that destructive force was pathetic!

131
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,890
All three of them are still barely alive!

132
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:57,910
I-I've taken more damage than I thought...
I-I have to put them all away quickly...

133
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,820
and then recuperate...

134
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,410
T-This brat has...

135
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,650
...re-grown his tail!

136
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:41,260
H-His tail? That's right... In the past,
Goku's tail suddenly grew back, too...

137
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,570
If he were to transform,
that would be a problem!

138
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,640
<i>Gohan's tail has once again grown out.</i>

139
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,510
<i>Could this be a symbol</i>
<i>that the fate of the Earth–</i>

140
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:13,490
<i>that the fate of mankind–</i>
<i>is to be saved from extinction?</i>

141
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,690
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

142
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,560
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

143
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,930
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

144
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,430
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

145
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,910
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

146
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,010
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

147
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,520
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

148
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,190
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

149
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,700
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

150
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,760
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

151
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

152
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,670
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

153
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:45,340
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

154
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,510
<i>So sorry.</i>

155
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:52,620
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

156
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,590
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

157
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,210
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

158
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,610
<i>Gohan, look at the ball of light in the sky!</i>

<i>It's our last gamble!</i>
<i>Transform into a Great Ape!</i>

160
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,580
<i>T-That's right! If Gohan becomes a Great Ape,</i>

161
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,120
<i>he'll revert to being a ferocious Saiyan!</i>

162
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,950
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

163
