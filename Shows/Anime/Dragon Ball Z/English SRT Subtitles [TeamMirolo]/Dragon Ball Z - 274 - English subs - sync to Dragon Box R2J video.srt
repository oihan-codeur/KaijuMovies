<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,065
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:41,695
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,705
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,635

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,645

00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,655

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,045

24
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:12,665
<i>Goku and Vegeta have slipped</i>
<i>inside the body of Majin Boo.</i>

25
00:02:12,705 --> 00:02:16,535
<i>However, there was plenty</i>
<i>lying in wait for the two of them...</i>

26
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:42,185
<i>One after another, the two</i>
<i>were assaulted by many traps.</i>

27
00:02:42,225 --> 00:02:47,105
<i>Will they indeed be able to</i>
<i>safely find Gohan and the others?</i>

28
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:17,055
What the hell are you doing, Kakarrot?!
Tear those lower life forms off of you!

29
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:21,065
I know! But my body is...!

30
00:03:21,105 --> 00:03:22,645
Kakarrot!

31
00:03:27,735 --> 00:03:33,945
<i>"Nightmares or Illusions!?</i>
<i>Goku and Gohan's Father-Son Confrontation."</i>

32
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:38,615
Kakarrot!

33
00:03:58,635 --> 00:04:00,185
My stomach hurts!

34
00:04:02,685 --> 00:04:05,605
Of all the... You're such an idiot!

35
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,275
And you told me not to
make such a commotion!

36
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,655
He's sure to have found us out from that!

37
00:04:10,695 --> 00:04:16,785
M-Maybe so. And I was even
trying to hold back quite a bit, at that!

38
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:40,475
Big brother!

39
00:04:40,515 --> 00:04:43,475
Big brother! Big brother! Big brother!

40
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:47,105
Poppa! It's Big brother!

41
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:52,445
P-Poppa? I've got an
awfully bad feeling about this!

42
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:57,575
K-Kakarrot! Despite how I may seem,
I cannot stand squirmy things!

43
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:04,665
Sure enough, here he comes!

44
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,505
I think I'm gonna vomit!

45
00:05:06,545 --> 00:05:09,795
Poppa! Those guys were bullying us!

46
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:16,845
Hey, Kakarrot! We've already been
found out from what happened earlier!

47
00:05:16,885 --> 00:05:19,685
No need to worry about that any more, right?

48
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:23,805
Well, I don't know... H-Hey, Vegeta!

49
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:29,565
W-What?!

50
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:34,065
Poppa, hurry up and put those guys away!

51
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:36,365
Yeah, yeah!

52
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:44,705
What did you do that for, Poppa?

53
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:49,415
You've done something
naughty again, haven't you?!

54
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:51,715
How many times do I have to
tell you before you understand?

55
00:05:51,755 --> 00:05:54,595
I told you, you can't go
straying off so far from the herd!

56
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:58,755
You really don't listen to
a thing your Poppa says!

57
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:09,525
Um, has this boy committed any misdeeds?

58
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:10,685
Misdeeds?

59
00:06:10,725 --> 00:06:15,525
I-If that face moves any closer, I'll kill him...!

60
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:21,705
You see, this boy has the bad habit of
taking off after anything he sees moving.

61
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:25,705
I am not about to be attacked because
of someone's habit! For the love of...

62
00:06:25,745 --> 00:06:28,705
Ah, that's right! Say...

63
00:06:28,745 --> 00:06:31,415
There are these people
that are dressed like we are.

64
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:33,715
They would have looked a
bit less handsome than me.

65
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:35,715
I wonder, have you seen anyone like that?

66
00:06:35,755 --> 00:06:37,545
I know who you mean!

67
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:40,715
There was one who was green, too!

68
00:06:40,755 --> 00:06:42,675
Piccolo, huh?

69
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:48,305
Say, where are those guys now?

70
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,275
Y-You turn into a toilet!

71
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:00,985
All right...

72
00:07:10,535 --> 00:07:16,135
W-What's this? What's Boo
making a toilet for all of a sudden?

73
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:19,135
Maybe he's upset his stomach or something.

74
00:07:19,175 --> 00:07:21,135
Is that so?! All right, then...!

75
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:23,135
J-J-Just a minute!

76
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:27,475
This is our chance! Right now,
even I might be able to beat him!

77
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:29,645
Th-That's crazy! You can't!

78
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:32,645
Let's not do this! It's obviously not sensible!

79
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:37,695
No! Today, for sure, I, the strongest
man in history, Mister Satan, will...

80
00:07:43,535 --> 00:07:44,495
Pee-yew!

81
00:07:44,535 --> 00:07:48,415
Th-That was a fart every
bit worthy of the name "Boo"...

82
00:07:55,045 --> 00:07:57,625
The green person went up above here.

83
00:07:57,665 --> 00:08:01,135
Yeah. The people I saw
went up above here too.

84
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,055
Up?

85
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:17,695
It's Boo's toilet-time!

86
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:21,405
Why is that?! This is earlier than he usually is!

87
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:28,455
Hey! Tell us more! Where do
you mean by "above here"?

88
00:08:32,575 --> 00:08:35,085
I'm sure I heard him
say it's toilet-time, right?

89
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:38,545
Yeah! Which, you don't
suppose means that we...

90
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,545
Aw, crap!

91
00:08:40,585 --> 00:08:43,425
...is what we're going to become?!

92
00:08:46,595 --> 00:08:47,845
Hey, Vegeta!

93
00:08:53,435 --> 00:08:54,605
Hey!

94
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:13,085
Still, to think that while
I was sealed up by Bibidi's spell,

95
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:17,205
so many guys as strong as
them would appear on Earth...

96
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:33,935
However, now they have all become
my power! My muscle! My blood!

97
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:47,115
Looks like we've finally
come to the inside of Boo's head.

98
00:09:47,155 --> 00:09:49,495
This is the only place left.

99
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:52,535
Gohan and the others must
be inside here somewhere.

100
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:07,005
Kakarrot, which way do you think?

101
00:10:07,045 --> 00:10:09,465
Let's see...

102
00:10:09,505 --> 00:10:10,635
The left way, I guess!

103
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:14,975
Is that so? In that case, I'm going right.

104
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,975
Hey, you can't just do that!

105
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:19,985
When I'm together with you,
nothing good happens.

106
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:22,525
Fine, suit yourself!

107
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:52,055
Who's that?! Who's over there?!

108
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:06,445
Gohan!

109
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:26,585
You guys! Are you okay?

110
00:11:28,635 --> 00:11:32,595
Come on, we're breaking
out of here, quick! Hurry!

111
00:11:49,605 --> 00:11:51,115
What?

112
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:19,095
They've done it! Everyone is safe!
Now, quickly, outside of Boo you go!

113
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:23,105
Don't you think it's strange?

114
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:27,435
Why do you suppose those little
squirts have undergone Fusion?

115
00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:38,575
Gohan! I've been looking for you!

116
00:12:44,705 --> 00:12:48,295
W-What are you doing, Gohan?!

117
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:05,395
Why, you... You're not Gotenks at all, are you?!

118
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:13,025
Now that I know that... I'll show you no mercy!

119
00:13:22,165 --> 00:13:25,665
It's the whole lot of you!
Mess around with me, huh?

120
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,665
H-How come?!

121
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:32,295
What are Gohan-<i>san</i> and the rest
doing to Goku-<i>san</i> and Vegeta-<i>san</i>?

122
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,675
Is that it?

123
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,845
That is indeed Boo's brain.

124
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:42,685
The Gohan and Gotenks and such
that are in there are not the real items.

125
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:47,065
They're memories! Those are Gohan and
the others from among Boo's memories!

126
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:49,645
From among Boo's memories?

127
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:03,875
I figured it out right away
that you ain't the real Gohan!

128
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:05,625
Just by looking in your eyes!

129
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:13,715
Though it seems you have
the same power as the real thing.

130
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:16,085
You really have gotten stronger!

131
00:14:48,585 --> 00:14:50,045
W-Where am I?!

132
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:55,335
R-Rotten Boo! You will face me! Come on!

133
00:15:05,765 --> 00:15:09,435
Ah, I'm so hungry.
Before I extinguish this planet,

134
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,475
I first need to fill my stomach!

135
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:21,655
That Boo!

136
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:26,325
Have you once again grown afraid
of me, Mister Satan, and run away?

137
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:45,305
Come, let us follow after him.

138
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,685
Y-You can't mean it!

139
00:15:48,725 --> 00:15:52,605
W-W-Why?! After he so graciously went away?

140
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,945
If the Earth is destroyed, then it will
be the same no matter where we are!

141
00:15:55,985 --> 00:15:57,605
We have to do something to him!

142
00:15:57,645 --> 00:16:01,115
W-W-What do you mean, do something?

143
00:16:01,155 --> 00:16:03,825
Boo has gone off looking for something to eat.

144
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:10,495
While he's eating, I'm sure we can
create an opening! That's where...

145
00:16:10,535 --> 00:16:16,505
<i>That's where I go "Whammo,"huh?</i>
<i>And then "Kaboom"and "Bam!"</i>

146
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:20,545
<i>B-But, can I do that?</i>
<i>I can't betray his expectations...</i>

147
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:23,675
<i>What will you do, Mister Satan?</i>

148
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,515
Come.

149
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:29,145
We're going already?
We don't have to go so soon...

150
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:31,555
Th-This can't be...!

151
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:48,035
Fighting against these
two opponents is truly hard!

152
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:51,535
And at a critical time like this,
Kakarrot is not around!

153
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:13,185
They gave me a lot of trouble!

154
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:28,615
W-What's this?

155
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:45,345
<i>Ka... me... ha... me... Ha</i>!!

156
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:12,115
Kakarrot!

157
00:18:12,155 --> 00:18:13,865
We meet again, Vegeta!

158
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:51,985
It's the smell of cake!

159
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:34,655
Sheesh, these guys don't quit!

160
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:38,075
No matter how many times we beat them,
they just keep getting right back up!

161
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:42,205
Yeah... On top of that, they
ain't taking a bit of damage!

162
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:02,855
Th-This is bad!

163
00:20:09,445 --> 00:20:15,155
Shortcake! <i>Choux à la crème</i> over
here! There's chocolate cake too!

164
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:30,335
W-What?!

165
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:40,095
W-W-What does this mean?!

166
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:43,315
Lucky! The instant he looked upon that cake,

167
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:47,565
his head became filled with thoughts of cake!

168
00:20:47,605 --> 00:20:49,645
Now's your chance, both of you!

169
00:21:15,045 --> 00:21:18,635
Where have Gohan and the others gone?

170
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,645
Have they been done in after all?

171
00:21:20,685 --> 00:21:23,645
Hey, Kakarrot!

172
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:26,355
This way! They're here!

173
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:34,565
It's Piccolo.

174
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:43,115
Great! He ain't dead!

175
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:48,495
Hey, Vegeta, over there!

176
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:03,055
Gohan! Trunks! Goten! Everyone's here!

177
00:22:04,185 --> 00:22:06,355
<i>Finally, with great trouble,</i>

178
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:09,525
<i>Goku and Vegeta have</i>
<i>discovered Goten and the others.</i>

179
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:14,525
<i>Rescue Gohan and the others as</i>
<i>soon as you can, and defeat Majin Boo!</i>

180
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:18,025
<i>Before the Earth is destroyed!</i>

181
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:38,385
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

182
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:44,975
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

183
00:22:49,185 --> 00:22:55,525
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

184
00:22:55,565 --> 00:23:01,655
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

185
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:08,665
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

186
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:14,045
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

187
00:23:14,715 --> 00:23:17,885
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

188
00:23:17,925 --> 00:23:26,975
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

189
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:28,515
<i>Even now?</i>

190
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:36,155
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

191
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:41,535
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

192
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:48,035
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

193
00:23:48,075 --> 00:23:58,045
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

194
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,025
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

195
00:24:15,065 --> 00:24:19,365
<i>Huh? What's this?</i>
<i>Boo has appeared inside Boo!</i>

196
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:21,985
<i>I thought something was funny,</i>
<i>and sure enough, it's you guys!</i>

197
00:24:22,025 --> 00:24:25,825
<i>How dare you release</i>
<i>everyone that I've absorbed!</i>

198
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,665
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

199
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:31,035
<i>"A Majin's Secret!!</i>
<i>Two More Boos Inside Of Boo"</i>

200
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:35,045
<i>He's finally found them. Will we</i>
<i>be able to get out of here safely?</i>

201
00:24:35,545 --> 00:24:39,175
"Next time"
"A Majin's Secret!!
Two More Boos Inside Of Boo"
