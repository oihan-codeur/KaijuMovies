1
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:17,500
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,300
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,810
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:04,820
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,180
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,910
<i>Kaio-ken!</i>

17
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,650
T-Thanks, Vegeta...

18
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,430
Not at all.

19
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,270
Die!

20
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:50,460
<i>The curtain is rising over a final</i>
<i>battle, with the fate of the Earth at stake.</i>

21
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,270
<i>"A Hot, Unbounded Battle!</i>
<i>Goku vs. Vegeta."</i>

22
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,610
We're going to change
the location of our battle.

23
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,210
Suit yourself. It will all end up the same.

24
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,030
<i>I should have guessed.</i>

25
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,470
<i>He's following with confidence to spare.</i>

26
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,450
Gohan...

27
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,520
Hey, Gohan!

28
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,220
–Yes?
–Let's hurry back to Kame House.

29
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:06,500
Let's stop worrying about him already.
We've left the fate of the Earth up to him.

30
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,740
It's okay, Gohan! I'm sure
Goku will come through for us!

31
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,210
Come on, let's go. Show
your mom that you're all right.

32
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,690
Right.

33
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,970
All right, there won't be any
people or animals around here.

34
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,620
I see...

35
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,460
You've chosen here to
be your gravesite, have you?

36
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,270
You should be thrilled.

37
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,400
A lower-class warrior such as yourself

38
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,940
is about to be toyed around
with by a super-elite, after all.

39
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,250
Saiyans have their warrior ratings
examined right after they are born.

40
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,620
When they do, the scum that
have lower ratings, such as yourself,

41
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,220
are sent off to planets that do not
have terribly formidable opponents.

42
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,430
In other words...

43
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,430
You were a left-behind!

44
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,300
And as a result, I was sent to Earth here?

45
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,430
I should be thankful. But what's more...

46
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,280
Even a left-behind might be able to overcome
an elite, if he tries desperately enough.

47
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,280
An amusing joke.

48
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,180
Now then, allow me to show you
a barrier that you cannot overcome,

49
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,120
no matter how hard you try!

50
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,650
What's the matter, Kakarrot?!
You can do better than this, can't you?!

51
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,430
When you defeated Nappa, you had
to have been doing better than this!

52
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:21,900
Let me see it!

53
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,940
I should have expected as much...

54
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,040
He still ain't the least bit serious,

55
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,610
but his speed and techniques
already surpass my own.

56
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:46,420
Show me what you've got! Or have
you already used up all of your power?

57
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,260
You got it. I'll show you!

58
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,950
<i>Kaio-ken!</i>

59
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,220
If that's the limit of what you've got,
then I'll be greatly disappointed!

60
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,660
<i>What a powerful bastard!</i>

61
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,260
And yet,

62
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,170
even though I'm in this kind of
trouble, I'm starting to get excited.

63
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,830
I don't see a thing.

64
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,230
What's the matter?

65
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,830
This is because you got violent with it!

66
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,830
What, are you blaming someone else?!

67
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,840
Well it's the truth!

68
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,040
No, no, that's not why, Sis.

69
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,640
It's not because the crystal ball is broken,

70
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,210
it's because the terribly
fierce power of their <i>ki</i>

71
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,980
is concealing them from even
the spiritual powers of your crystal ball.

72
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,750
Then, at least they're still fighting, right?

73
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,350
Probably.

74
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,460
I know! If I use that thing, I can tell!

75
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,730
How about it?

76
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:17,070
There are two large readings to the west.

77
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,870
Just two?

78
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,970
<i>He's smiling. Has he given up,</i>
<i>and adopted a defiant attitude?</i>

79
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,410
<i>Or is he poised because he can</i>
<i>raise his battle power up even higher?</i>

80
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,040
What's the matter?! Finished already?!

81
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,610
You seem to be at your limit.

82
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:02,780
In that case, let me show you
something, as your dying gift.

83
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,490
The overwhelming power of a super-elite Saiyan!

84
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,290
Let's see it!

85
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,020
That smirk of yours is
going to disappear very soon.

86
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,370
What a <i>ki</i>! It's as if the
whole Earth is shaking!

87
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,530
As before, images from the site of
battle have been completely broken off.

88
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,100
A-As of now, there is no way for us
to be able to conceive what is happening,

89
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,600
or indeed if it has all ended.

90
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,570
Now then, changing the schedule a little,

91
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,410
we now join this discussion of "What will
become of the Earth, and what is left for us?"

92
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,950
They ultimately don't know anything, do they?

93
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,580
Hey, if you're going to sleep, go sleep at home.

94
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,190
Shut up. Give me another.

95
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,990
Eh? That's your tenth one!
Do you have any money?

96
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,600
Tenshinhan is dead and all...

97
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,440
I don't have any need for this money anymore.

98
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,340
Hey, are you all right?

99
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,650
B-By the way, do you have
a place to stay? If you like–

100
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,650
I can hear it.

101
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,490
W-What?

102
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,090
Can't you hear that sound?!

103
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,650
W-What are you going on about?

104
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,860
H-Hey, look!

105
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,740
W-What is that?!

106
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,520
T-The crows are fleeing from something!

107
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:30,520
It's like there's a typhoon!

108
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,770
The trembling of the atmosphere has stopped.

109
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,800
A-All the clouds have been blown away, too.

110
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,700
It's over, Kakarrot!

111
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,680
You fool! Behind you!

112
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,810
<i>Kaio-ken</i> times two!

113
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,010
All right, nice going. Way to avoid it.

114
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:54,590
<i>Damn... What power and speed! I can't</i>
<i>even keep up with him with a 2x Kaio-ken.</i>

115
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,000
I guess I ain't got much choice.

116
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:05,170
Even if I wreck my body, it's better than dying.

117
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,570
I'll have to raise the <i>Kaio-ken</i> to 3x.

118
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,740
I intentionally made that
one easy to dodge for you.

119
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,450
It wouldn't be any fun to have
you die on me so easily, after all.

120
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,900
<i>They came close by, so I can't help but</i>
<i>come take a look at 'em, but what's this?</i>

121
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,570
<i>Both Goku and that bastard're so strong,</i>
<i>it's like I'm havin' a bad dream here!</i>

122
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:50,080
<i>Now then, I wonder how long my body</i>
<i>will hold out once I raise the Kaio-ken to 3x...</i>

123
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,320
What's the matter, Kakarrot?! Come get me!

124
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,560
<i>Either way, I have to do it.</i>
<i>Ain't no way I can win like this.</i>

125
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,200
Have you lost everything up your sleeve?
Looks like you picked the wrong opponent.

126
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,600
I was the number-one most
powerful man, even among the Saiyans.

127
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,770
No matter how much training
you've done, you're still just a left-behind.

128
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:18,780
Looks like your time of death
has been extended by only a little bit.

129
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,150
<i>T-This is bad. That Saiyan</i>
<i>bastard's overwhelmin'ly got it over him.</i>

130
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:29,390
<i>I'd best be gettin' outta here now,</i>
<i>while I can, huh? Yeah, I'd better get goin'.</i>

131
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,660
<i>It won't do no good</i>
<i>for me to be here anyhow.</i>

132
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:57,520
May my body withstand this!
Times three <i>Kaio-ken!</i>

133
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,690
No! You can't go any
higher than 2x, Son Goku!

134
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,490
Although, there's definitely
no way he can win like this.

135
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,560
I never imagined he'd
have that much strength.

136
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,010
He may not be able to win this fight.

137
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,530
W-What's going on?

138
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,970
H-Has something happened?

139
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:57,010
I think it's probably Son<i>-kun</i>, but this
battle power reading is rising incredibly...

140
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,510
–Goku!
–Goku<i>-sa</i>!

141
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,580
17,000... 19,000... 21,000...

142
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,760
It can't be!

143
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,410
W-What?

144
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:17,250
<i>Ignoring Kaio's warnings,</i>
<i>Goku uses a times three Kaio-ken.</i>

145
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:24,100
<i>Will Goku's body be able to</i>
<i>withstand a battle power beyond its limits?</i>

146
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,320
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

147
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,190
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

148
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,560
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

149
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,070
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

150
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,540
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

151
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,650
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

152
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,150
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

153
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,790
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

154
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:29,300
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

155
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,400
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

156
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,230
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

157
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,270
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

158
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:44,940
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

159
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,110
<i>So sorry.</i>

160
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,250
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

161
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,230
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

162
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,700
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

163
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,840
<i>My body is at its limits! I need a</i>
<i>times three Kaio-ken Kamehame-Ha!</i>

164
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,910
<i>At this point, as much</i>
<i>as I dislike how ugly it is,</i>

165
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:22,380
<i>I'll transform into a Great Ape, and crush you!</i>

166
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:26,220
<i>The strength of my Great</i>
<i>Ape form is nothing to sneeze at!</i>

167
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,920
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

168
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,520
<i>"Now, Goku! A Final Technique</i>
<i>With Everything On the Line."</i>

169
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,100
<i>My father is the strongest guy in the universe!</i>

170
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,830
"Next time"
"Now, Goku! A Final Technique
With Everything On the Line"
