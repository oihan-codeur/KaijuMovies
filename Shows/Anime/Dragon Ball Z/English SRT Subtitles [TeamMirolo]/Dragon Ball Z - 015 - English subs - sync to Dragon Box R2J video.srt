4

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,380
<i>The Saiyans, strongest in the universe,</i>

17
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,950

Let's see...

21
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:46,310
Goku<i>-sa</i>, look at this! Gohan is
already solvin' problems as difficult as this!

22
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,520
I can't wait to see what kind of
great scholar he'll become in the future!

23
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,420
Yeah, I'll bet!

24
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,700
Mother... Father...

25
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,350
<i>Try taking this on! Makankosappo!</i>

26
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:17,070
H-He avoided it! W-What kind
of bastard is he, with such speed?

27
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,310
You pierced through this armor
quite easily. That's quite a technique.

28
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,450
If I had taken that head-on,
I would have been out!

29
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,450
That doesn't mean anything if I don't hit you!

30
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,580
To think that you would inflict injury upon me!

31
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,290
You're going to pay for
this! I'm through playing around!

32
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,700
It doesn't mean anything if I don't hit you!

33
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,580
All right!

34
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,040
Wow, I did it!

35
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,160
I lost a great deal of
time to Old Lady Snake there.

36
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,360
If I don't hurry up, things will get nasty!

37
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,660
Oh, no you don't!

38
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,390
Hey, we meet again!

39
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,770
It sure is big!

40
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,420
I wonder how long this beach goes on for.

41
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,020
Mother...

42
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,430
Chichi!

43
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,780
I brung some of my special-made porridge.

44
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,280
Eat some of this, you'll feel better, Chichi.

45
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,710
Nope.

46
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,950
You ain't eaten nothin'
for a whole week now, have you?

47
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,220
Come on, just eat this.

48
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,730
I'm not goin' to...

49
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,120
Gohan...

50
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,410
Huh? That's what I made!

51
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,990
I've come back to the starting point.

52
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,920
All right, then...

53
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,870
This is an island!

54
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,530
Beyond there is Mother! All right, then!

55
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,310
<i>Makankosappo!</i>

56
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:56,630
This one looks like it's the best.

57
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,170
All right, then...

58
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,670
Thank you!

59
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,480
Move it, move it, you're in the way!

60
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,610
It's finished!

61
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,780
I did it! I did it!

62
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,720
All right, now...

63
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,760
All right, here I go!

64
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,170
It's okay, I'll be back right away!

65
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,270
I'm just going to go see
my mother for a little while.

66
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,210
That should be good enough...

67
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,500
–The kid!
–It couldn't be!

68
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,490
Rain?

69
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:37,220
There's a storm coming!

70
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,970
<i>I can't turn back now!</i>

71
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:58,640
<i>I've got to tough it out!</i>
<i>Got to tough it out!</i>

72
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,860
It's okay, it's okay. I'll get through...
I'll get through the storm soon enough!

73
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:29,210
Ah, this is bad! If this keeps up,
I'll be swamped! And I can't swim!

74
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,740
I... can't swim! I can't swim!

75
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,280
<i>That dirty brat! Where the hell did he go?</i>

76
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,760
<i>Gohan, what about your training with Piccolo?</i>

77
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,860
<i>Have you forgotten</i>
<i>about the crisis the world is in?</i>

78
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,600
<i>Eight months remain until the Saiyans arrive.</i>

79
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,490
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

80
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:54,390
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

81
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,770
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

82
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,270
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

83
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,740
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

84
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,810
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

85
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,320
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

86
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,990
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

87
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,500
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

88
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,600
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

89
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,430
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

90
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,470
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

91
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:45,140
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

92
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,310
<i>So sorry.</i>

93
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,420
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

94
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,390
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

95
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:15,170
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

96
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,880
<i>What? Gohan ran away from Piccolo?</i>

97
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,950
<i>You brat! Tell me your mission!</i>

98
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,880
<i>To defeat the Saiyans, and to save the Earth.</i>

99
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,750
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

101
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,230
<i>But I still do want to see Mother.</i>

102
