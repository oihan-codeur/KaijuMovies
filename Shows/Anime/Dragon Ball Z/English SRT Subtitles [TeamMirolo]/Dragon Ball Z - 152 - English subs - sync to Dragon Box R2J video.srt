<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:24,535
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,575 --> 00:00:29,785
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:36,545
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:43,095
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:51,975
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,015 --> 00:00:55,475
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,515 --> 00:01:04,485
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:07,955
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:14,085
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:17,455
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:26,425
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,465 --> 00:01:29,975
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,015 --> 00:01:36,855
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:38,815
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:05,885
<i>In order to protect No. 17,</i>
<i>No. 16 at last steps forward.</i>

17
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,515
<i>No. 16 fights evenly balanced against Cell</i>

18
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:11,225
<i>with his incredible power. However...</i>

19
00:02:53,305 --> 00:02:57,095
<i>I can regenerate myself, at</i>
<i>least to an extent such as this!</i>

20
00:02:58,475 --> 00:03:04,855
<i>"No. 17 Swallowed...</i>
<i>The Transforming Cell Is a Super Gourmet."</i>

21
00:03:55,745 --> 00:03:59,335
Then in order to keep you
from becoming your perfect form,

22
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,705
there's nothing I can do but
squash the very life out of you?

23
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:05,665
Such a thing is impossible, however.

24
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,925
I won't know until I try.

25
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:15,055
I do know.

26
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:43,995
Hell's Flash!!

27
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:33,915
What an incredible shockwave! What's going on?

28
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,095
<i>Unfortunately, it's not Piccolo.</i>

29
00:07:39,135 --> 00:07:43,015
<i>His ki vanished a bit earlier.</i>

30
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:44,425
<i>Is it Cell?</i>

31
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:47,185
<i>Or is it No. 17 and the others?</i>

32
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,015
In any case, I have to hurry
and bring back the controller.

33
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:53,225
That's the only thing I can do right now!

34
00:07:55,565 --> 00:07:58,065
F-Father!

35
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:01,195
Yeah. I felt it too.

36
00:08:01,235 --> 00:08:04,995
T-That Cell guy's <i>ki</i> has suddenly gotten small!

37
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:09,115
<i>I don't know who you are, but keep it up!</i>

38
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:13,915
<i>Until the time when Vegeta</i>
<i>and Trunks finish their training!</i>

39
00:08:35,185 --> 00:08:37,145
U-Unbelievable!

40
00:08:38,945 --> 00:08:41,615
He's that strong?

41
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,325
N-No. 16...

42
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,825
Incredible...

43
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:53,085
Are you still here? I thought
I told you to get away, No. 18!

44
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:56,085
It's okay now, isn't it?
You've taken care of him!

45
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,795
I haven't beaten him at all!

46
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:59,295
He has to have taken damage,

47
00:08:59,335 --> 00:09:02,345
but he's not the kind of
opponent to die from such an attack!

48
00:09:02,385 --> 00:09:06,595
No. 17, while you have a chance!
You get out of here too!

49
00:09:06,635 --> 00:09:08,305
Get out of here, you say?

50
00:09:08,345 --> 00:09:09,935
You've got to be joking!

51
00:09:09,975 --> 00:09:11,515
He's given me a rough time of it,

52
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:13,975
and you expect me to run off
without scaring the hell out of him?!

53
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:17,645
He's taken damage, right?

54
00:09:17,685 --> 00:09:21,815
Then I will finish him off with my own hands!

55
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:24,615
Come on out, you monstrous freak!

56
00:09:24,655 --> 00:09:28,365
What's the matter,
weren't you going to absorb me?!

57
00:09:29,865 --> 00:09:32,785
I will neither run nor hide!

58
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:35,915
Not until I've squeezed
your life's breath from you!

59
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:44,925
No. 17, behind you!! It's Cell!!

60
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:52,055
As you wish, I've come forward!

61
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,195
Oh, hell!

62
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:31,385
H-He swallowed him!

63
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,085
Run away, No. 18!

64
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,005
What are you doing?! Run!!

65
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,135
You'd better get out of here too!

66
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:01,605
That Cell guy's <i>ki</i> has billowed up incredibly!

67
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:03,145
This isn't good!

68
00:12:03,185 --> 00:12:07,895
No. 17 or No. 18–one of them
appears to have been absorbed by Cell!

69
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:20,975
Come on, let's get out of here, No. 18!

70
00:13:44,785 --> 00:13:47,545
W-What incredible speed!

71
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:54,255
This is bad. This is really bad!

72
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:06,185
Did you think you would
be able to escape from me?

73
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:21,785
Forgive me, Chaozu. I just might die.

74
00:14:24,535 --> 00:14:28,165
Even I myself am surprised
by my magnificent speed.

75
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:32,045
Of course, this is due to absorbing No. 17.

76
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:35,635
I wonder how my power is.

77
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:29,645
Oh, it appears to have
gone up quite a bit as well.

78
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:39,485
Now then...

79
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:49,495
That's good.

80
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:51,495
You at least understand
that trying to escape from me

81
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:53,585
is an utter waste of effort.

82
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,165
You're a sharp one.

83
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:05,135
And so, now it's your turn.

84
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:09,345
Together, let us create the perfect form!

85
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:33,165
Just try coming any closer!
I'll blow myself up if you do!

86
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:35,755
If I die on you, you're screwed, right?!

87
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:51,935
Do you hear my voice, No. 18? It's me, No. 17!

88
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:56,065
I've now joined bodies with Cell.

89
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:59,985
It's a great sensation! It's wonderful!

90
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:02,525
You should have yourself absorbed right away!

91
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:07,575
Only by doing that can we
become the ultimate life form!

92
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:09,575
N-No. 17...

93
00:17:09,615 --> 00:17:12,205
D-Don't fall for it, No. 18!

94
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:14,745
That is Cell!

95
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,715
He's only using No. 17's voice!

96
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:21,045
You keep your unnecessary
remarks out of this! Be silent!

97
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:24,635
Robots cannot understand our feelings.

98
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:28,725
Come, No. 18. There is no losing your way.

99
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:32,265
Hurry and become one with us,
and obtain the greatest of powers!

100
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:35,565
Then we will carry out
Doctor Gero-<i>sama</i>'s will...

101
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:41,275
...defeating Son Goku, and placing
the entire universe in our hands!

102
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:45,485
You are not No. 17!!

103
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:51,745
We hated Doctor Gero for
reconstructing us as he pleased!

104
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:55,245
Under no circumstances would
he ever say "Doctor Gero-<i>sama</i>!!"

105
00:17:56,585 --> 00:18:01,255
Having come to this, I will absorb
you, even if I have to force you!

106
00:18:03,795 --> 00:18:05,965
Cut out the useless resistance!

107
00:18:06,005 --> 00:18:10,975
For you to launch an energy blast,
you will need a moment to charge it.

108
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:12,645
There's a possibility

109
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:16,475
that I can move sooner than
that and prevent your suicide.

110
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:21,435
Give it up!

111
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,655
Dammit!

112
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:59,515
Small fry! What the hell is it you're trying to do?!

113
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:13,405
<i>Shin-Kikoho</i>!!

114
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:33,555
This ki...!

115
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:35,725
It's Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>'s <i>ki</i>!

116
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:39,395
D-Don't tell me Tenshinhan is taking on Cell!

117
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:29,565
What are you doing?! Get out of here, now!!

118
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:33,615
Why, you!

119
00:20:48,465 --> 00:20:49,215
Can you fly?

120
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:50,755
Yeah, more or less.

121
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:28,125
Cut it out! Stop it already! Stop it, Tenshinhan!

122
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:31,005
If you use the <i>Kikoho</i> technique
any more than this, you'll die!

123
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:45,685
<i>Cell has at last absorbed No. 17.</i>

124
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:13,715
Stop it, Tenshinhan!

125
00:22:13,755 --> 00:22:16,885
<i>Not even Tenshinhan's</i>
<i>Shin-Kikoho has an effect on Cell...</i>

126
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:19,845
<i>...as he approaches his perfect form!</i>

127
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:27,105
<i>Will the Saiyans, Vegeta,</i>
<i>Trunks, Goku and Gohan, be in time?</i>

128
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:47,795
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

129
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:53,635
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

130
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:56,005
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

131
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:04,515
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

132
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:10,985
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

133
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:15,105
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

134
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:18,615
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

135
00:23:18,655 --> 00:23:21,235
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

136
00:23:22,995 --> 00:23:28,745
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

137
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:32,835
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

138
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,675
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

139
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:38,675
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

140
00:23:38,715 --> 00:23:44,345
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

141
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:46,515
<i>So sorry.</i>

142
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:51,685
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

143
00:23:54,395 --> 00:23:59,695
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

144
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,625
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

145
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:14,165
<i>Maybe I ain't got the power now, but Cell,</i>

146
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:17,335
<i>just you wait one day, and I'll</i>
<i>be sure to thoroughly defeat you!</i>

147
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,675
<i>What can you do in just one day?</i>

148
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:24,015
<i>You just watch on wistfully</i>
<i>as I achieve my perfect form.</i>

149
00:24:24,055 --> 00:24:25,975
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

150

<i>"Tomorrow, I Am Going to Pulverize You!!</i>
<i>Goku's Challenge."</i>

151

<i>Don't blame us if you end up in tears tomorrow!</i>

152
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:35,855
"Next time"
