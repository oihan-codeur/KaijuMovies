3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:14,145
<i>Vegeta, with his gift for fighting,</i>
<i>easily defeats No. 1 9. But then...</i>

17
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:38,235
Looks like he's gotten too
used to using an opponent's <i>ki...</i>

18
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,765
...to follow their moves.

19
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:08,425
If I drain all of their energy,

20
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:13,465
and add it to my own, then I can beat Vegeta!

21
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:25,085
<i>"A Reality More Terrifying than the Future!?</i>
<i>Trunks' Suspicions."</i>

22
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:14,755
Oh. Don't scare me like that!

23
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:29,445
Shoot. Not being able to
see your foe like this is eerie.

24
00:05:53,865 --> 00:05:59,365
Damn. Really, where did
he disappear to, anyhow?

25
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:00,835
If this is the way it's going to be,

26
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:06,245
I wish I'd done like Vegeta said
and went home to have some milk!

27
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:19,025
So then, whose energy should I take first?

28
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:29,875
It has to be Piccolo, the most
powerful one next to Vegeta!

29
00:06:37,745 --> 00:06:41,075
With what I can get from Piccolo,
anything becomes possible!

30
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:45,045
You just wait until I come for you, Vegeta!

31
00:06:56,635 --> 00:06:58,595
Damn.

32
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:01,035
He might already have gotten away.

33
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:18,045
No one will find us!

34
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:21,055
I know exactly where everyone else is!

35
00:07:23,955 --> 00:07:27,655
Now then, to take your energy...

36
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:46,745
G-Gohan, come here! Now!

37
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:51,615
T-The Artificial Human's got me...

38
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,985
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

39
00:07:54,025 --> 00:07:55,855
Which way?

40
00:08:06,435 --> 00:08:08,995
A faint <i>ki</i> disruption. This way!

41
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:18,835
Only a small amount of
your energy still remains.

42
00:08:33,725 --> 00:08:36,855
All that's left is for you to die–

43
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:04,915
Y-You saved me, Gohan.

44
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:11,495
B-But how?!

45
00:09:11,535 --> 00:09:14,435
There wasn't any way he could have found me!

46
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:37,025
Kuririn<i>-san</i>! Let Piccolo<i>-san</i> have a senzu!

47
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:39,715
Yeah!

48
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:55,205
<i>I still can't beat Vegeta,</i>
<i>not even with this level of energy.</i>

49
00:09:56,645 --> 00:09:58,875
You flea-market doll...

50
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:07,455
<i>I'll have to take energy from the others as well.</i>

51
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:13,285
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

52
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:41,985
Let me handle this, Vegeta!

53
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:46,855
Stay out of this, no matter what!

54
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:52,555
If you're wanting to die, that's up to you...

55
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:56,465
but won't you just be providing
him with more energy unnecessarily?

56
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:09,005
<i>"Stay out of this"?</i>

57
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,485
<i>This is perfect!</i>

58
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,985
<i>I'll just absorb his energy once again!</i>

59
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:19,615
<i>And once I do...</i>

60
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:22,025
<i>Vegeta won't pose any...</i>

61
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:28,685
<i>That shouldn't have happened!</i>

62
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:32,565
<i>I must have let my guard down, that's all.</i>

63
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:11,135
I-Impossible!

64
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:15,505
There's no reason I shouldn't
be able to defeat him!

65
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:20,175
After all, it was his energy
I took and added to my own!

66
00:13:22,545 --> 00:13:27,545
At the least, the power I have acquired
should be more than equal to his!

67
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:56,505
I-I was afraid of this. I'm too late.

68
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:57,315
Both Goku<i>-san</i>'s team...

69
00:13:57,355 --> 00:14:00,475
...and the Artificial Humans are no longer here.

70
00:14:01,255 --> 00:14:04,415
The island is all blown apart, but
just what exactly happened here?

71
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:10,695
I'd like to take the time machine
a little further back in time,

72
00:14:10,735 --> 00:14:13,725
but I've just barely got enough
energy to get back home.

73
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,325
On top of that, the machine
doesn't exactly work perfectly.

74
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:18,165
I might miss my intended time again.

75
00:14:24,575 --> 00:14:28,205
<i>Ki</i>! I sense fighting <i>ki</i>!

76
00:14:28,245 --> 00:14:31,045
So that's it! They're fighting in a different place!

77
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:49,495
Piccolo<i>-san</i>! Incredible!

78
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,235
Such strength!

79
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:54,105
What kind of training could Piccolo have done?

80
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:56,765
He's not even a Super Saiyan!

81
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:10,985
Why, you...!

82
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:33,705
Hang in there, Goku!

83
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:37,585
Get better quickly, so we can
go back and beat those guys!

84
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:49,125
I'm positive! They must be
where that explosion just was!

85
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:52,225
There's no reason fer us to go there, right?

86
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,325
Let's jes' go back home.

87
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:57,395
We'll be better off lettin'
Goku an' them take care of this.

88
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:59,995
'Sides, we got this tyke.

89
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:13,745
Did you see that just now?
That was the boy from the future!

90
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:18,115
Hey, lookit! You raised
yer voice and woke 'im up!

91
00:16:18,155 --> 00:16:20,285
That boy is on his way to fight!

92
00:16:20,325 --> 00:16:22,325
I knew this is the right direction!

93
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:25,355
All right, Let's go!!

94
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:31,725
Down there.

95
00:16:49,155 --> 00:16:50,745
Behind you!

96
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,505
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

97
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,655
Make a note of this.

98
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:35,195
As we fight, we can take
our energy, as you call it,

99
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:38,565
amplify it, then release
it in one explosive burst.

100
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:48,175
This is why the energy
you took from me earlier...

101
00:17:48,215 --> 00:17:50,145
...made so little difference.

102
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:56,545
We've won!

103
00:17:56,585 --> 00:18:01,755
Looks like what that young man
from the future said was wrong!

104
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:25,215
What kind of Artificial Human is this?

105
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:29,745
What is everyone else fighting against?

106
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:48,135
This isn't right. What's going on?

107
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:53,145
The fight is still going on!

108
00:18:56,045 --> 00:19:00,785
<i>That one... was different from</i>
<i>the Artificial Humans I know of.</i>

109
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:03,585
<i>How can that be?</i>

110
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,825
<i>Are there three Artificial Humans?</i>

111
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,675
Curse you, Piccolo!

112
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:29,175
To think even you raised
your power by so much...

113
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:30,675
According to the original order of history,

114
00:19:30,715 --> 00:19:32,775
you two Artificial Humans...

115
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:36,185
...were supposed to have killed
just about every single one of us.

116
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:39,815
But it looks as though that future
is going to change, doesn't it?

117
00:19:39,855 --> 00:19:44,195
Does that mean you guys weren't
as strong as you were supposed to be?

118
00:19:44,235 --> 00:19:45,565
Or maybe...

119
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:50,695
...we just became too strong for you?

120
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,135
Hey, we did it!

121
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,705
We're going to win this
time even without Goku!

122
00:19:57,745 --> 00:19:59,735
Right!

123
00:19:59,775 --> 00:20:02,745
I'm not all that happy with the
unusual increase in power both Piccolo...

124
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,715
...and Vegeta have undergone, but
for now, at least I'm relieved about this.

125
00:20:06,755 --> 00:20:10,015
Piccolo! Hurry up and put him away!

126
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:13,025
That is, unless you'd like me to do it?

127
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,985
Thanks anyway,

128
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:20,095
but I am the embodiment of
evil cast off by Kami, after all.

129
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,365
I'm not all mushy about this the way Goku is.

130
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:30,105
Who's that?!

131
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,635
I-It's...

132
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,115
Trunks?!

133
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:40,745
<i>What?</i>

134
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:42,415
<i>Trunks?</i>

135
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:47,425
<i>Trunks, did you say?!</i>

136
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:49,655
<i>But that's the same name as my kid!</i>

137
00:20:49,695 --> 00:20:51,355
<i>The same name!</i>

138
00:20:52,135 --> 00:20:54,325
<i>He came from the future–</i>

139
00:20:56,135 --> 00:20:58,735
<i>So that's it!</i>

140
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:08,585
<i>H-He's different too!</i>

141
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:16,115
<i>A-Another new guy just arrived!</i>
<i>Who is this one?</i>

142
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:18,595
<i>I-I have no data on him at all.</i>

143
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:28,125
<i>Regardless, this was all a terrible</i>
<i>miscalculation, especially for me.</i>

144
00:21:28,165 --> 00:21:30,735
<i>All that remains is for me to go back...</i>

145
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:33,135
<i>...to the laboratory.</i>

146
00:21:37,715 --> 00:21:40,905
W-Who is that guy down there?

147
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:43,745
He is who you were fighting with, isn't he?

148
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:44,715
What?

149
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:50,555
Who is he? Isn't he one of the
Artificial Humans you told us about?

150
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:56,125
What does this mean?

151
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:59,155
Y-You mean he isn't?!

152
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:04,335
W-What's this? You're saying he isn't?

153
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,495
It can't be!

154
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:11,135
<i>Trunks' unexpected statement...</i>

155
00:22:11,175 --> 00:22:14,505
<i>Can this mean there are other Artificial Humans,</i>

156
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:18,545
<i>in addition to No. 1 9 and No. 20?</i>
