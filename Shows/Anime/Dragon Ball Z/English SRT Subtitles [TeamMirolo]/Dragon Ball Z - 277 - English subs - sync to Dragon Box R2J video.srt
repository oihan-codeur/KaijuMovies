<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,065
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:41,695
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:48,955
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:54,705
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,595

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,045

What would happen if I rip this guy out?

24
00:01:57,105 --> 00:02:04,155
P-Please! You must not rip that guy
out by force! I won't be me any more!

25
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:09,485
That sounds interesting! Did you
think I would listen to what you say?!

26
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,785
Come on!

27
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:01,755
<i>At last, Goku and Vegeta,</i>
<i>together with Gohan and the others,</i>

28
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:04,165
<i>escaped from the inside of Majin Boo's body.</i>

29
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:09,755
<i>However, Boo once again began to transform.</i>

30
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:22,565
He's intent on transforming again!

31
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:24,685
I wish he'd cut that out already.

32
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:29,615
H-He's turning back...!

33
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:45,755
We did it, huh Vegeta? We may be
able to manage something like this!

34
00:03:45,795 --> 00:03:53,755
<i>Stay sharp, Goku and Vegeta! That's</i>
<i>no ordinary way that Kaioshin is terrified!</i>

35
00:03:55,675 --> 00:04:02,145
<i>"Earth Disappears!!</i>
<i>Boo's Reverse-Transformation of Evil."</i>

36
00:04:19,915 --> 00:04:24,875
Is that Boo? He's just a child now, isn't he?

37
00:04:24,915 --> 00:04:28,875
All right! This will work!
I'll settle things this time for sure!

38
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,885
No, you won't!

39
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:32,795
That's not the way it is.

40
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:39,385
I'm having a chill run through
the very core of my body...

41
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:53,775
Apparently, Boo has turned back into a kid.

42
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:57,485
In any case, let's carry Gohan and
the others to someplace where it's safe.

43
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,445
Snap out of it!

44
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:32,735
Hey, snap out of it, Gohan!

45
00:05:38,115 --> 00:05:41,705
Vegeta, it's all right! Everyone's still alive!

46
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:50,795
Turned back, you say?

47
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:55,635
What do you mean by that? Tell me!

48
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:58,095
I-It's like this...

49
00:06:00,465 --> 00:06:05,645
At the time, Earthlings were
first beginning to walk on two legs.

50
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,605
In the Kaioshin Realm,

51
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:11,275
under a kind and gentle
Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama,</i>

52
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:13,855
there lived the Kaioshin of the North...

53
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,945
...the Kaioshin of the West...

54
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:19,655
...the Kaioshin of the South...

55
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:23,705
Come on, give that back!

56
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:30,625
Come and get it!

57
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:44,265
...as well as myself, the Kaioshin of the East.

58
00:06:44,305 --> 00:06:49,475
That is, until Madoshi Bibidi
created the terrible Majin Boo.

59
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:06,785
Get them! Give it to them!

60
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,455
Kill them all!

61
00:07:37,895 --> 00:07:43,445
That was quite over-the-top
of you, again. Incredible, Boo!

62
00:07:48,915 --> 00:07:52,795
Papparapa!!

63
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:58,335
You idiot! A little closer and you
would have done me in as well, you know!

64
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:04,135
So then, onto the next planet...

65
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:11,015
At first, two of the Kaioshin were killed.

66
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:17,815
In order to oppose Boo, Kaoishin of
the West and Kaioshin of the North acted...

67
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:33,535
I'm sick of listening to the Kaioshin!
They can't stand up to us, can they?

68
00:09:04,905 --> 00:09:07,365
Where does he think he's going this time?

69
00:09:07,405 --> 00:09:11,915
Good grief, he doesn't listen
to a single order I give him!

70
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:49,325
K-Kaioshin of the West!
K-Kaioshin of the North, too!

71
00:11:33,015 --> 00:11:37,435
And then, Kaioshin of the South,
who was the most hardy and strong of us,

72
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:41,225
was absorbed by Boo...

73
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:45,775
And that's how he became that
huge Majin Boo from earlier, then?

74
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:49,025
Yes.

75
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:11,545
I was the youngest, and most
powerless, but somehow I was spared,

76
00:12:11,585 --> 00:12:14,465
and was only badly hurt.

77
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:17,225
That was thanks to
the Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama...</i>

78
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:47,005
G-Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

79
00:13:27,495 --> 00:13:31,625
G-Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

80
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:34,675
The next one to be absorbed was the chubby,

81
00:13:34,715 --> 00:13:38,555
yet kind and gentle Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama.</i>

82
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:48,645
H-Hey, Boo! Are you really Boo?

83
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:52,985
Hey, I've been playing a lot,
and now my tummy's empty.

84
00:13:53,025 --> 00:13:55,695
Gimme something to eat.

85
00:13:58,615 --> 00:14:02,665
I-I'm sure there was some cake back at home.

86
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:07,495
Cake? Is that yummy?

87
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,665
Y-Yeah!

88
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:17,675
It's quite yummy! Cake is the
most delicious food in the universe!

89
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,675
It's really that yummy?

90
00:14:21,715 --> 00:14:24,685
I'll let you eat cake every day from now on.

91
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:30,645
In exchange, you have to obey
everything I tell you to do. Okay?

92
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,485
Yep!

93
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:36,485
The Majin Boo that Bibidi
created was the very essence of evil.

94
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:40,495
It was a failed creation, that not
even Bibidi himself could handle,

95
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:42,745
but by absorbing the Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama,</i>

96
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:46,115
he became somehow or
other able to control him.

97
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:53,175
So then he finally became complete.
Which then would mean...

98
00:14:53,215 --> 00:15:00,675
That little Majin Boo now is the
very first, most difficult one, then?

99
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:05,935
Yes. His heart, which through absorption
had allowed his power to even be reduced,

100
00:15:05,975 --> 00:15:08,265
has returned back to its original form.

101
00:15:10,515 --> 00:15:15,485
To an existence without
any self-control, of evil itself.

102
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:25,205
Boo is on the move!

103
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:20,505
W-What is that?!

104
00:16:20,545 --> 00:16:22,845
His screaming is impossibly loud!

105
00:16:35,685 --> 00:16:36,775
What is he...?!

106
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,165
Th-That was close! That bastard!

107
00:16:55,205 --> 00:17:00,505
He tried to blow the Earth away
all of a sudden! Thank you, Vegeta!

108
00:17:00,545 --> 00:17:05,515
He's got to be joking! Was he
trying to blow himself away too?!

109
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:10,595
No. Even if he were blown to bits,
he'd soon return to normal again.

110
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:18,775
Hey, Boo! If you're going to
blow up this planet, that's up to you,

111
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:22,025
but how about you do
it after you've fought us?!

112
00:17:27,115 --> 00:17:29,325
That's more like it.

113
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:44,255
W-What's this?!

114
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:49,805
I-It's huge! He's kidding, right?
Is he planning to launch that?

115
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:55,265
We can't repel something like that!

116
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,315
H-Hey...

117
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:09,655
Go hand over your Potara to them!

118
00:18:09,695 --> 00:18:12,405
R-Right! O-Okay!

119
00:18:29,715 --> 00:18:32,515
S-Stop, Boo!

120
00:18:32,555 --> 00:18:35,095
Please! The Earth will be...!

121
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,605
You were going to fight us, right?

122
00:18:55,455 --> 00:18:57,665
H-Have to save everyone...!

123
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,665
Vegeta! This way! I'll do
Instantaneous Movement with everyone!

124
00:19:02,705 --> 00:19:04,215
All right!

125
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,095
Grab on!

126
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,275
<i>It's no use! There ain't enough time!</i>

127
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:40,875
<i>It's hopeless! I can't do Instantaneous</i>
<i>Movement in such a brief amount of time!</i>

128
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:45,505
H-Here!

129
00:19:51,045 --> 00:19:52,965
H-Hey!

130
00:20:09,605 --> 00:20:12,405
So you see, he wanted to get
a better grade, but it dropped!

131
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:14,325
Really?!

132
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:16,505
Thank goodness! You made it!

133
00:21:20,635 --> 00:21:27,605
We may have made it, but the
Earth, and Gohan and the others...

134
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:30,895
W-Where am I? H-Heaven?

135
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:41,615
Hey!! Kakarrot!!

136
00:21:41,655 --> 00:21:46,995
Why the hell did you save these guys
and that dog before Trunks and the others?!

137
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:57,055
I am sorry.

138
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:09,525
<i>In the end, Goku was unable to</i>
<i>save the Earth, or Gohan and the others.</i>

139
00:22:09,565 --> 00:22:16,115
<i>However, there's no time to be</i>
<i>despondent! Boo is not yet dead!</i>

140
00:22:34,175 --> 00:22:38,795
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

141
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:45,345
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

142
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:55,945
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

143
00:22:55,985 --> 00:23:02,035
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

144
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:09,045
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

145
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:14,415
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

146
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:18,295
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

147
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:27,355
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

148
00:23:27,395 --> 00:23:28,895
<i>Even now?</i>

149
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:36,525
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

150
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:41,945
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

151
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:48,415
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

152
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:58,465
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

153
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:15,735
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

154
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:17,905
