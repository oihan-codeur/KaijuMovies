<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,530
<i>Awaiting resurrection,</i>

17
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:59,240

<i>As had Goku.</i>

19
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,690
<i>However, the scramble over</i>
<i>the Dragon Balls on Planet Namek</i>

20
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,400
<i>was growing even more intense.</i>

21
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,950
Hurry! Hurry and go after him!

22
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,250
H-He escaped outside!

23
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:58,270
<i>"An Enormous Battle Power!!</i>
<i>Freeza's Scheme is Shattered."</i>

24
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,230
Where are you?! Where are you?!

25
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,710
Where did you run off to, Vegeta?!

26
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,510
He couldn't have gotten away that fast.

27
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,170
He must be hiding somewhere.

28
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,180
Have you not found him yet, Zarbon<i>-san</i>?!

29
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,850
If you disgracefully allow
him to escape you like this,

30
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,880
I will have you take
responsibility with your life.

31
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,730
Fool! Go ahead and search
outside as much as you like.

32
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,270
1... 2... 3... 4...

33
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,070
There are indeed five of them here.

34
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,940
Not only have they healed my injuries,

35
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,750
they're going to have every last one
of their Dragon Balls taken from them.

36
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,850
But I can't get away carrying all five of them.

37
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,720
What's more, it doesn't look like
I have the time to calmly think this over.

38
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,330
All right...

39
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,550
Please, let this work!

40
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,920
Hey! You fell for it! I'm still inside the ship!

41
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,550
What was that?!

42
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,580
D-Damn it all!

43
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,060
Now!

44
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,070
Where is Vegeta?!

45
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,510
D-Do not tell me that
Vegeta is after the Dragon Balls!

46
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,440
All right, and now for me!

47
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,110
T-The Dragon Balls!

48
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,100
That bastard!!

49
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,820
W-Where is he this time?!

50
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,260
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, is he still inside the spaceship?

51
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,270
Look for him!

52
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,800
Y-Yes, sir!

53
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,850
<i>If I were to unwisely escape through the air,</i>

54
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,380
<i>Freeza would overtake me in an instant.</i>

55
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,670
What disgraceful behavior!

56
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,810
Not only did you allow Vegeta to escape,

57
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,540
but with the Dragon Balls, as well!

58
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,980
There is no way that
he could have run away

59
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,210
with all five Dragon Balls in that short moment!

60
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,480
I will search the inside of the spaceship,

61
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,550
so you are to thoroughly search outside!

62
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,890
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,660
You are prepared to answer for this, yes?

64
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:26,190
If you are unable to bring
Vegeta back here in one hour...

65
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,810
Y-Yes, sir!

66
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,880
Let's see...

67
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,010
It's around here.

68
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,520
T-This is awful...

69
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,990
Vegeta must have done this.

70
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,490
Who's there? Is someone there?

71
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,820
Oh...

72
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,830
And after they had grown this many of them...

73
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,070
I'm sure they should have
fallen around here somewhere.

74
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,240
There they are! There they are!

75
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,040
That's magnificent control,
if I do say so myself.

76
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,920
Take that, Freeza.

77
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,090
I've finally gotten your Dragon Balls!

78
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,890
Now, including the one
that I sunk at that village,

79
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,600
I only need one more to have all seven.

80
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,270
A strong battle power! Is that Zarbon?

81
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,070
No, the battle power is lower than Zarbon's.

82
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,240
I-Is that?!

83
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,550
Just you wait, Gohan!

84
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,220
Once you go to Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>'s place,

85
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,250
you'll become much, much stronger!

86
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,400
He's that Earthling!

87
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,900
W-Why is he here on Planet Namek?

88
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,610
What's more, he was
holding the final Dragon Ball.

89
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Just how far is luck going to go my way?!

90
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,180
That's the last one.

91
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,390
People of Planet Namek,
may you please rest in peace.

92
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:26,520
Now then, I have to hurry
and look for that Dragon Ball.

93
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,880
Huh? This way?

94
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,250
It's not inside a house?

95
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,140
I get it. Not even Vegeta
would find it if it's in the lake, huh?

96
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,510
Here it is!

97
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,530
Here it is, here it is.

98
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:18,040
9995... 9996...

99
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,390
9997...

100
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,520
After I've done 10,000 of these,

101
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,530
I'll do 60-times gravity. I'm on it...

102
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,730
9998...

103
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,900
9999...

104
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:51,070
10,000!

105
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,840
W-What is this? I can't move my body at all...

106
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,710
Dammit...

107
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,380
That was fast! I'll be there real soon!

108
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,020
It looks like that Earthling is
after the Dragon Balls as well.

109
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:45,030
But I'm going to take
that one that you're holding.

110
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,060
Then I will have all
seven of the Dragon Balls!

111
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,370
Dammit! Where the hell is Vegeta?!

112
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,040
If only I had a Scouter,
I could easily detect him!

113
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,060
If it keeps going like this, I'll have
to surrender my life to Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

114
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,560
Is that Vegeta?!

115
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,240
No, that's the guy who
rescued that Namekian kid.

116
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,770
But he's carrying something
that looks like a Dragon Ball.

117
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,180
Vegeta!

118
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,550
I've finally found you!

119
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,420
You're mine now!

120
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:08,340
There's a huge battle power following me.

121
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,110
It looks like Zarbon has found me.

122
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,150
What an annoying bastard.

123
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,620
But this is a good opportunity.

124
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,820
I'll take care of him for sure this time.

125
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,660
He'll be full of confidence in
himself after our previous battle.

126
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,530
His guard ought to be down.

127
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:39,200
It will take more than this!

128
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,510
This is crazy, Goku!

129
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,880
Bulma's daddy...

130
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,460
You're going to die, suddenly
jumping to 100-times gravity like that.

131
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,130
I-I was doing it at 50-times gravity...

132
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:04,800
Are you sure the machine ain't broken?

133
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,800
Don't be absurd! My machine is flawless.

134
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,110
B-But still...

135
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,140
<i>Just a moment.</i>

136
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,350
W-What's this?

137
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,830
I figured it out, Goku.

138
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,170
The gravity device control has become unstable.

139
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:43,540
It's because your spaceship has
entered an intense magnetic storm.

140
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,870
W-What do I do?

141
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:53,780
It will take another hour before
you're through the magnetic storm.

142
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,850
A-An hour?

143
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,790
I ain't going to last that long!

144
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,790
In any event,

145
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,790
you have to turn off the gravity
machine's switch without a moment's delay.

146
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,000
T-That's easy for you to say...

147
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,860
Huh?

148
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,440
Well if it isn't Kuririn!
Don't startle me like that!

149
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,110
I-Isn't this dangerous, Bulma<i>-san</i>?

150
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,180
If you're outside leisurely reading a book,

151
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,450
they're going to find you.

152
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,680
What are you talking about?

153
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,120
If I stay inside that cave all the time, I'll–

154
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,220
Huh? Could that be... a Dragon Ball?

155
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,390
You got it!

156
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,900
Native Dragon Balls are gigantic, huh?

157
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,800
The Grand Elder was quite understanding.

158
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,370
Oh, right, right! Bulma<i>-san,</i>
is Gohan inside the house?

159
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:28,810
I'd like to take him to
the Grand Elder's place, too.

160
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,810
He went to go find another Dragon Ball.

161
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,480
Huh?

162
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,050
It showed up on the Radar.

163
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,820
Remember, near that
village that Vegeta attacked?

164
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,490
Huh? Really?

165
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,560
A <i>ki</i>! It's heading this way!

166
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,830
It's right next to us!

167
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,830
It's Gohan<i>-kun.</i> That was fast, huh?

168
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,100
N-No, it's not Gohan!

169
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,100
V-Vegeta!

170
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:09,820
<i>Oh, crap! I was so ecstatic over</i>
<i>becoming stronger that I didn't notice his ki!</i>

171
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,490
This is an unexpected place
to run into you, huh, Earthling?

172
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,360
I didn't think you guys
had the civilization it took

173
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,160
to make it all the way to this planet.

174
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,700
Looking at that Dragon Ball that
you're so carefully holding onto,

175
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,400
it appears our goals are the same.

176
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,070
Listen, before I take that Dragon Ball
from you, there's something that I have to do.

177
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,840
But you'd better not get any funny ideas,
like running away with that thing.

178
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,750
It won't be just you–that
woman will end up dying as well.

179
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,420
He's here.

180
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,570
W-Who is that?

181
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,870
Judging by his face, I wonder
if he isn't a champion of justice...

182
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,070
T-This is the worst...

183
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,550
<i>Once again, a battle to</i>
<i>the death was about to begin.</i>

184
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,750
<i>What fate will Kuririn and the others meet?</i>

185
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,590
<i>And what about Goku?</i>

186
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

187
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

188
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

189
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

190
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

191
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,910
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

192
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

193
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

194
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,560
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

195
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

196
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

197
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

198
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

199
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

200
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,480
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

201
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,490
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

202
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

203
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,540
<i>I've been knocked back by my Kamehame-Ha.</i>

204
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,840
<i>That's 100 Gs for you. I've</i>
<i>broken bones throughout my body!</i>

205
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,780
<i>Goku, get here, quick!</i>

206
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,410
<i>Whether Vegeta or Zarbon wins,</i>
<i>it's a worst-case situation!</i>

207
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,420
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

208
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,390
<i>"I'm Back to My Old Self Again!!</i>
<i>Goku Under 100-Times Super-Gravity."</i>

209
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:36,330
<i>It looks like Zarbon has</i>
<i>underestimated the power of Saiyans.</i>

210
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,090
"Next time"
"I'm Back to My Old Self Again!!
Goku Under 100-Times Super-Gravity"
