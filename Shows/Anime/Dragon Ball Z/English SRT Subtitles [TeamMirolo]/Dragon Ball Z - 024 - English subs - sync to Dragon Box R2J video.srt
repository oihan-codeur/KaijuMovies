<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:52,300
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

7
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,810
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:04,820
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,290
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:37,180
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,020
<i>With the fate of the Earth at stake,</i>

17
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,560
<i>the deathmatch between the Saiyans</i>
<i>and Piccolo and the others continued.</i>

18
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,910
<i>And so, at length,</i>
<i>Yamucha became its first casualty.</i>

19
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,220
Y-Yamucha<i>-san</i> must have
had a bad feeling about this.

20
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,720
T-That's why he went in my place.

21
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,670
Damn it all! Damn it all!
What do I tell Pu-erh and Bulma<i>-san</i>?!

22
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,970
<i>"Farewell, Ten-san!</i>
<i>Chaozu's Suicide Strategy."</i>

23
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,130
There, there...

24
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,990
Y-Yamucha...

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
Pu-erh!

26
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,030
Hey, Pu-erh!

27
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,470
Stay with me! Hey!

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,370
Pu-erh too, huh?

29
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,220
My, my, the sofa is
going to be all full at this rate.

30
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,360
Come on, Bulma, take heart.

31
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,360
What are you talking about?!
How can I be calm with Yamucha dying?!

32
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,870
You don't have to worry about Yamucha.

33
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,380
This is the first time
Yamucha has died, right?

34
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,290
We can always bring him back to
life with the Dragon Balls, can't we?

35
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,820
That's right! That's right, isn't it?

36
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,060
Yes, that's right!

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,370
You dirty old man!

38
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,200
What a pathetic Saibaiman–ending in a draw!

39
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,250
What did he think he was
doing, against scum like that?!

40
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,550
Hey, clean that up. He's dirtying up the place.

41
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,620
That pile of filth.

42
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,300
<i>You dirty bastard!</i>

43
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,470
Get back, everyone!

44
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,420
Let me show you the results of my training!

45
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,090
Go!

46
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,130
What is that...

47
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,040
slow-moving blast?

48
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,010
We'll be caught in the blast!

49
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,180
It's got tremendous energy,
but almost no speed at all.

50
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,150
It's like it's saying, "Get out of the way!"

51
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,520
You did it!

52
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,550
He did it! He did it!

53
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:50,700
He did it! He did it! He did it! He did it!

54
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,440
H-Hold on, B-Bulma... L-Let me go...

55
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,370
I-Incredible!

56
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,380
Kuririn, are you okay?

57
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,080
Yeah. But I missed one of them.

58
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,760
Burn in hell!

59
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,120
<i>Just what you'd expect from Piccolo.</i>

60
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,220
<i>I shudder to think about him</i>
<i>becoming my enemy again someday.</i>

61
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,130
Thank you, Piccolo<i>-san.</i>

62
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:02,510
Don't get the wrong idea.
You think I would save you?

63
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,180
I was just warming up for the marvelous
battle that is about to get underway.

64
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,350
Assuming that's the kind
of fight it turns out to be...

65
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:32,270
Well then, as you wish, how
about we put an end to the games?

66
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,670
This means it's time for the real thing!

67
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,180
<i>Impossible! It had</i>
<i>hardly any effect on him at all!</i>

68
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,510
<i>They were hit dead-on!</i>

69
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,520
I-I did that at full power!

70
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,060
So that's what a Saiyan is, is it?

71
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,210
Please let me handle them. I'll put all
five of them away in the blink of an eye.

72
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,010
Do as you like.

73
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,380
However...

74
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,510
...do not kill the Namekian.

75
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,820
We'll need to get him to tell us
about the Dragon Balls afterward.

76
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,890
Yes, understood.

77
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,830
Now then, entertain me
the best that you can. First off...

78
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,040
I'll start with you!

79
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,910
Let me handle this!

80
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,930
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

81
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,440
Looks like this is going to be somewhat fun!

82
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,900
What?

83
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,980
T-The ground is shaking!

84
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,710
I-It's no use!

85
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,720
Ten<i>-san</i>!

86
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,720
M-My telekinetic powers aren't working!

87
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,630
T-This can't be!

88
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:20,100
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

89
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,730
Stand firm, Gohan!

90
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,170
B-But!

91
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,570
Control your <i>ki</i>!

92
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:30,580
Don't let yourself be
browbeaten by this level of <i>ki</i>!

93
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:31,640
R-Right!

94
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,130
<i>S-Still, I had no idea it would be this bad...</i>

95
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,190
Hmm? Is that–?

96
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,350
The Snake Princess' palace.

97
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,600
W-What was that just now?

98
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,040
Beats me.

99
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,010
If memory serves, that was the
midpoint of the Serpentine Road.

100
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,420
<i>All right, everyone, just you wait!</i>

101
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,230
Chaozu! Be careful!

102
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,050
H-Here he comes!

103
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:28,360
Now then, which one of
you shall I take care of first?

104
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,450
Tenshinhan!

105
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,360
Get out of there!

106
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,040
Ten<i>-san</i>!

107
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,610
Hmph! What fragile folk.

108
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,810
Now to finish you!

109
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,420
You filthy bastard!

110
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,500
Tenshinhan<i>-san</i>!

111
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,420
That's one tough bastard. He's still alive.

112
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:09,460
W-What power he has!

113
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,200
Dammit! Tenshinhan!

114
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,600
Wait!

115
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,230
He's had it! Leave him alone!

116
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,240
Don't interrupt!

117
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,540
I can't see the bottom
of the hole! Unbelievable!

118
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,910
What an incredible energy wave!

119
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,780
Ch-Chaozu!

120
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,350
Was he done in just now?!

121
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,500
Chaozu!

122
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,600
Don't worry!

123
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,470
I'll send you to him
soon enough– in the next world!

124
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,770
<i>D-Damn...</i>

125
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,850
Nappa! Look behind you!

126
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,010
Chaozu!

127
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,620
Why, you!

128
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,190
When did you get back
there?! Come on, let go!

129
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,520
Why, you... why, you... runt!

130
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,690
Come on! Come on!

131
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,580
Chaozu! Get away from him!

132
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,010
Chaozu<i>-san</i>!

133
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,020
Look at him.

134
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,620
Look at him! Don't turn away.

135
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,560
This is what fighting is.

136
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,200
You're a persistent one!

137
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,030
Chaozu! That's enough! Get away from him!

138
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,010
T-Ten<i>-san...</i>

139
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,010
Thank you.

140
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,250
W-What are you saying... Chaozu?

141
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,420
Get away from there!
Get away from there, now!

142
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,760
I enjoyed... being together... with you...

143
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,610
Chaozu! What are you thinking?!

144
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,810
Farewell, Ten<i>-san.</i> Please don't die.

145
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,580
D-Don't tell me... you're–!

146
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,790
Farewell. Farewell!

147
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,680
Stop! Chaozu!

148
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,910
Farewell!

149
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,150
Chaozu!

150
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,290
Blowing himself up
and taking them both out–

151
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,360
that was a pretty drastic thing to do.

152
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,900
For a little squirt, that was nicely done.

153
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,330
That was a worthless thing to do!

154
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,530
Nappa, he sure gave you
a lot of trouble, considering.

155
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:25,370
I-I-It can't be! How can he
be unfazed?! T-That's awful!

156
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,940
Chaozu even gave up his life!

157
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,510
Chaozu has already been brought
back to life with the Dragon Balls.

158
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:41,920
He can't be brought
back to life again! Dammit!

159
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,220
You're going to pay for this!

160
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,530
It looks like you still don't
realize how fearsome we are!

161
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,130
The only thing you
have coming to you is death!

162
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,190
<i>The warriors are falling, one by one.</i>

163
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,420
<i>Is there anything that</i>
<i>Tenshinhan and the others can do</i>

164
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,590
<i>in the face of the Saiyans' powers,</i>

165
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,930
<i>which are far greater than they anticipated?</i>

166
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,950
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

167
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,830
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

168
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

169
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,700
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

170
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,180
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

171
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,280
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

172
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,780
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

173
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,450
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

174
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,960
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

175
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,030
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

176
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,870
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

177
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,940
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

178
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:45,610
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

179
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,780
<i>So sorry.</i>

180
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:52,880
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:23:55,590 --> 00:24:00,860
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,670
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

183
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,380
<i>Damn, are these Saiyans immortal?!</i>

184
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,880
<i>Chaozu, I will avenge you.</i>
<i>And then I'll be coming.</i>

185
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,880
<i>I won't let you be lonesome all by yourself!</i>

186
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,890
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

187
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,790
<i>"Tenshinhan Cries Out!!</i>
<i>This is My Final Kikoho."</i>

188
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:36,000
<i>Father! Come quickly!</i>

189
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,490
"Next time"
"Tenshinhan Cries Out!!
This is My Final <i>Kikoho"</i>
