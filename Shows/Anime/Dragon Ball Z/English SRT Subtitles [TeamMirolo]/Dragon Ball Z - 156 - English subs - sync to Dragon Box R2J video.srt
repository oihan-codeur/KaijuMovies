3
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,890
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,640
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,230
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:52,080
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

8
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:04,590
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:14,180
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,560
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,950
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,910
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,380
<i>As Cell mercilessly and indiscriminately attacks,</i>

17
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,970
<i>hunting down No. 18 in</i>
<i>order to achieve his perfect form,</i>

19
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,520
Watch very carefully, Cell!

20
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,850
I'm going to erase that disagreeable
little smile of yours for you!

21
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,350
<i>The intense power of a newly-born</i>
<i>Vegeta rises above that of the monster Cell!</i>

22
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,440
<i>Is this the power that surpasses Super Saiyan?</i>

23
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,160
<i>"On Your Knees, Cell!</i>
<i>I Am Super Vegeta!!"</i>

24
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,970
What's the matter?!
Did you doze off or something?

25
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,430
You lousy Saiyan Monkey!
You're pretty spirited, aren't you?

26
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,770
However, at this level of battle power,
it's no more than a brave pretense!

27
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,480
Is that so?

28
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,360
<i>This is the fruit of his training.</i>

29
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,410
<i>Cell is unable to see Dad's motions through.</i>

30
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,080
I couldn't see... how Vegeta moved!

31
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,420
You've got to be more
serious about this, Cell.

32
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,050
It would seem you're
not too bad at this, huh?

33
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,970
<i>So, this is the extent of the</i>
<i>results of training in that room?</i>

34
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,330
Dad!!

35
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,920
Dad!

36
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,090
Do not bother me!

37
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,690
Worthless fool.

38
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:46,420
Dad!!

39
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,760
<i>I will go beyond Super Saiyan!</i>
<i>I will reign over the universe!</i>

40
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,390
<i>D-Dad...</i>

41
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,860
<i>Is this the extent of the</i>
<i>results of training in that room?</i>

42
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,820
What's the matter?! Is this over already?

43
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,560
That's right! It's over!

44
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,980
Your life, that is!

45
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,620
S-So that's it!

46
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,040
This incredible <i>ki</i> is Vegeta's!

47
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,540
<i>It's even greater than</i>
<i>Cell's ridiculously huge Ki!</i>

48
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,670
<i>What's going on?</i>

49
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:15,130
<i>That's right! Goku was</i>
<i>talking about that place</i>

50
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:19,550
<i>where you could do a year's</i>
<i>training in one day... is that it?</i>

51
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,270
Let's go see!

52
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,920
Come on, now! What are you
guys seeing all by yourselves?

53
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,550
How's Vegeta?! What's happening to Trunks?!

54
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,010
I-Incredible!

55
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,880
To think that he wouldn't be
having any problems with Cell!

56
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,680
H-He's winning! At this rate, he will defeat Cell!

57
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,180
Say, there! What's happening?

58
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,020
Is he winning? Is he losing?

59
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,730
It's okay!

60
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,440
He's overwhelmingly assaulting him!

61
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,610
Grrrrr...

62
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:19,740
Oh, dear, dear! Such a ferocious face...

63
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,410
How awesome, indeed!
Both your papa, and yourself!

64
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,460
There, there, there, there, there, there!

65
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,250
Just as you'd expect of battle maniacs, huh?

66
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,920
There, there, there, there!

67
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,060
<i>So this is power that</i>
<i>exceeds Super Saiyan, is it?!</i>

68
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,640
<i>This is how much difference in</i>
<i>power there is between us now?</i>

69
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,800
No, no! You're just making your <i>ki</i> larger.

70
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,810
Becoming Super Saiyan
gets its start from anger.

71
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,610
Get angry! Pop off, with a bang!

72
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,400
J-Just saying it like
that, I can't get angry.

73
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:45,030
I know! Either me,
or Piccolo, or even Kuririn–

74
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,410
try imagining that one of us
is about to be killed by Cell!

75
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,540
But, I've never seen Cell.

76
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,540
Good grief!

77
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,550
Ah, well, Freeza or anything else is okay!

78
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,010
Right!

79
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,610
I-It's no use...!

80
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,670
Starting right now, I'm
going to show you what hell is!

81
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,420
I shall enjoy it.

82
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,200
That was hell, then?

83
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,750
You do seem to want to
make me get serious about this.

84
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,590
I'd long thought you were already serious.

85
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,130
If that's the case, then
don't hold yourself back for me.

86
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,710
W-What's this?!

87
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,440
To think that he's been
concealing that much power...

88
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,170
That was quite a jump in your battle power.

89
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,380
Still, so what about it?

90
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,220
Dad has this won.

91
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,020
<i>There's Vegeta... and that's Cell over there.</i>

92
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,430
<i>They're monsters, both of them!</i>

93
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,420
So, this is your level after all?

94
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,590
Apparently, during my training,

95
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,430
I opened up too wide a
gap between our powers...

96
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,810
Impossible! You're...

97
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,600
Vegeta, aren't you? Am I wrong?

98
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,280
I... am Super Vegeta!

99
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,280
<i>With self-assuredness and power,</i>
<i>labeling yourself "Super Vegeta,"</i>

100
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,450
<i>will you settle this battle</i>
<i>right here and now, Vegeta?</i>

101
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,470
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

102
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:53,270
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

103
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,650
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

104
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:04,160
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

105
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,660
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

106
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,790
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

107
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,300
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

108
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,920
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

109
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:28,430
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

110
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,520
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

111
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,350
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

112
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,360
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

113
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,070
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

114
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,200
<i>So sorry.</i>

115
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,370
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

116
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,380
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

117
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,560
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

118
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,520
<i>What's wrong, Vegeta? As you are now,</i>

119
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,900
<i>you should be able to defeat</i>
<i>Cell. What are you doing?</i>

120
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,190
<i>Geez, here I wondered what</i>
<i>an exceptional guy you must be,</i>

121
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,900
<i>and that's all you've got? How disappointing!</i>

122
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:23,700
<i>Killing you has become a frivolous matter!</i>

123
