<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,210
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,960
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,550
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,850
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:54,610
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,190
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,500

<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,100
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,940
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,740

Gohan! I'm entering, too!

24
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,960
Father!

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,380
It's been a long time, huh everyone?

26
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,630
Y-You're really going to be
at the Tenkaichi Tournament?!

27
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,800
What's this? Goku is coming
back from the Next World for one day

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,720
in order to participate in
the Tenkaichi Tournament!

29
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,350
Goku, too?!

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,900
It's been a long time
since we've seen Goku, huh?

31
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,990
<i>At the Kame House, Kuririn and No. 18,</i>

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,450
<i>who had distanced themselves from fighting,</i>

33
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,070
<i>and were living in peace and quiet,</i>

34
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,570
<i>decided to enter the tournament as well.</i>

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,630
<i>Vegeta and Piccolo, who</i>
<i>heard the news from Gohan,</i>

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,960
<i>had their fighting spirits</i>
<i>unusually fired up over the matches,</i>

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,460
<i>after going so long without fighting.</i>

38
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,980
Goten! This is terrific!

39
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,480
You'll be able to see your pa for one day!

40
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,240
<i>Roughly one month</i>
<i>remained before the tournament.</i>

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,370
<i>Gohan had at last plunged</i>
<i>himself into a period of training.</i>

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,580
All right, shall we get started?

43
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:29,930
<i>"Even Gohan is Surprised!</i>
<i>Goten's Explosion of Power."</i>

44
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,180
What an incredible <i>ki</i>!
He's been at it since yesterday,

45
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,980
and instead of growing weaker,
he's getting stronger and stronger.

46
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,520
It must be because Goku-<i>san</i> will be
participating in the Tenkaichi Tournament.

47
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,820
J-J-Just a minute!

48
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,370
Hang on! You're going too fast!
I haven't even done any warming up here!

49
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,370
I'm going to go even harder!

50
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,380
Oh! Working up a sweat so early
in the morning, huh? Way to go!

51
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,140
–Thank you for the meal.
–Thank you for the meal.

52
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,770
Okay, Goten, let's head out!

53
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,780
Uh-huh!

54
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,570
–We're off!
–We're off!

55
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,990
Goten!

56
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,570
Don't get in the way of your
brother's trainin'. Understand?

57
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,870
After all, we need to have your brother
do well at the Tenkaichi Tournament,

58
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,960
and make sure he gets plenty of prize money.

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,960
We're hittin' the bottom of Pa's fortune already.

60
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,960
I won't be in the way.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,380
Really? In that case, okay.

62
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,550
Goten, what are you doing?!
Hurry up, or you'll be left behind!

63
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,560
Wait up!

64
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,510
Be careful, Goten!

65
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,790
Goten! Where are you?!

66
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,420
Maybe I ran a little too fast for him.

67
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,680
That tickles! Cut it out! Cut it out, I say!

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,390
Big Brother! It's a dinosaur!
He's a friend of mine!

69
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,980
Come on, stop it, I tell you!

70
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,650
<i>What's the use?</i>

71
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:36,410
<i>Come to think of it, Mother always said</i>
<i>that his innocence was just like Father's.</i>

72
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,700
Hey! Big Brother's going on
ahead and starting his training, okay?

73
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,620
What?!

74
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Send Goku back, you say?

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,880
You already gave him
your permission, Uranai Baba?

76
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,390
I certainly have. There's no particular
reason why I should turn him down.

77
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:08,020
N-No reason, you say? It's going to be
difficult to accommodate this, though...

78
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,410
Goku has been bored, not being able
to undergo the Grand Kaio's training.

79
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,990
That's when the news of the Tenkaichi
Tournament being held came along.

80
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, for crying out loud...

81
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,160
If you're going to complain,

82
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,960
then how about giving
Goku his training right now?

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,170
T-T-Training?

84
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,710
W-Well, I, uh... I do have my own
circumstances to consider, and all...

85
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:44,560
Well, if Goku says he wants to go
back on that day, that should be all right.

86
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,550
Big Brother! Big Brother!

87
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,550
Wow, isn't this cute?

88
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,550
W-What is it?

89
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,010
See? It's a bug.

90
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,850
Y-Yeah...

91
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,400
Big Brother! Big Brother!

92
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,570
See? I found a lizard!

93
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:45,990
Look, what are you doing, Goten?!
We didn't come here to play!

94
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,290
Why don't you do some training, too,
by doing some pushups or something?

95
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,090
You're distracting me so
I can't concentrate, you know!

96
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,500
For crying out loud!

97
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,570
Big Brother! Big Brother!

98
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,410
Geez! Now what is it, Goten?!

99
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:29,830
Brother! I caught an amazing dinosaur!

100
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,550
Watch out!

101
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,310
Are you all right, Goten?

102
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,310
Oh, he surprised me.

103
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,480
For heaven's sake, what are
you doing? That was dangerous!

104
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,490
Don't you do anything else!
Just sit there and do nothing!

105
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,490
Okay. Understood, Big Brother.

106
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,310
Goten!

107
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,150
Could you help Big Brother out in his training?

108
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,770
Uh-huh!

109
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,320
That should do it.

110
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,910
What are we going to do with
all these stones, Big Brother?

111
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,240
We're going to use them in my
training to get back my sense of reflex.

112
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,830
What's a sense of reflex, Big Brother?

113
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,120
You're going to find out right now.

114
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,380
Goten, stand behind this line,
and throw those stones at Big Brother

115
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,300
as hard as you can. Do it like you mean business.

116
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,880
Mm-hmm, understood.

117
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,300
All right, ready, Goten! Throw them!

118
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,890
It's okay to throw them from this close?

119
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,640
Actually, you can throw them from even closer,

120
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,480
but we'll do it from there at first.

121
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,900
You're sure it's okay? You won't get hurt?

122
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,400
I'll be fine. Just throw as hard as you can!

123
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,320
Okay, here goes, Big Brother.

124
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,330
All right, come on!

125
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,120
Ready, set...

126
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,200
Go!

127
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,290
You were right!

128
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,460
Incredible! That's my Big Brother for you!

129
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,590
Okay, I'm going to start
throwing more and more.

130
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,640
J-Just–hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on...!

131
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:58,900
Maybe I should have you throw
from this line, after all, okay Goten?

132
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,770
Yeah, okay, Big Brother.

133
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,370
All right, I'm getting comfortable with this.

134
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,240
Goten, you can start coming closer!

135
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,790
You can come even closer!

136
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,380
W-What's the matter, Goten?

137
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,170
Say, is it okay if I become like you, Big Brother?

138
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,550
What do you mean, like Big Brother?

139
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:35,310
I want to turn into that Super Saiyan thing.

140
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,190
Sure, you can turn,

141
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,400
but I think that it might still be a
bit too much to ask of you, Goten.

142
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,360
Turning into a Super Saiyan
comes after doing the proper training.

143
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,370
That's right, after you've overcome
harsh, painful training is when you'll first–

144
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,500
G-Goten... s-since when
have you been able to...?

145
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,960
I forget.

146
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,880
U-Unbelievable.

147
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,760
Big Brother and our late
father had to struggle fairly hard

148
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,760
to become Super Saiyans.

149
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,770
Say, Goten, how would you
like to spar with Big Brother?

150
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,820
Do you know what that is–sparring?

151
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,990
Mm-hmm! Mother used to teach me
a lot when Big Brother was studying.

152
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,740
Mother did?

153
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,830
<i>Perhaps Mother has changed a</i>
<i>little since Father passed away.</i>

154
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,380
<i>She did say it was okay if I took</i>
<i>a break from school to train, too.</i>

155
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,670
Say, Goten...

156
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,890
Does Mother know that you
can turn Super Saiyan, Goten?

157
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,690
Come on, Goten! Your late pa
would laugh at you for doin' just this!

158
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,000
Yow-ow-ow-ow...!

159
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,710
Mother! I'm sorry!

160
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,170
Mother...

161
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,140
Now even Goten-<i>chan</i> has turned delinquent!

162
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,400
I showed her once, and she got mad at me.

163
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,110
She said I looked like a delinquent,
so I couldn't do it any more.

164
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,900
Mother hates us being Super Saiyan, after all!

165
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,670
All right, that's the way, Goten. Come on!

166
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,280
Ah, no fair, Big Brother!

167
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,950
It's no fair for you to fly!

168
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,830
How come?

169
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,870
How come? Playing no fair is no fair!

170
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,420
What is it with you?

171
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,380
You can't possibly not be able to fly, can you?

172
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,970
Even though you can turn Super Saiyan?

173
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,880
No, I can't fly!

174
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:43,390
Then you've done things all out of order, huh?

175
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,680
Big Brother, if you're thinking of flying,

176
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,810
then you have to teach me
how to do it too, or it isn't fair!

177
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,610
You got it, you got it!
Don't get so upset, Goten!

178
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:56,320
I'll teach you how to fly!

179
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,740
R-Really?!

180
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,900
Yeah!

181
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,910
Wow! Yahoo! That's great!

182
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,380
I-Is that... Don't tell me...

183
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,800
V-Videl-<i>san</i>...!

184
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:33,350
Th-That's right! Videl-<i>san</i>
asked me to teach her how to fly!

185
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,980
Big Brother, what's the matter?

186
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,820
Nothing, it just looks like you're
going to have another pal, Goten.

187
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,570
Another pal?

188
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,080
Listen, Goten, there's going to be a girl

189
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,000
from the same school that
Big Brother goes to coming here.

190
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,920
We can't let this girl see how strong we are.

191
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,960
And we especially can't turn
Super Saiyan, no matter what.

192
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Ah, I get it. It's because she'll
think we're delinquents, right?

193
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,970
W-Well, close enough, I guess.

194
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,760
Come on, let's hurry home!

195
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,030
You know, Big Brother, you're
amazing. I didn't hit you once!

196
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,820
I've still got a long way to go, huh?

197
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,830
Even so, Goten, you've got
an incredible gift for fighting.

198
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,330
You surprised me! Big Brother
didn't know you were that good!

199
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,420
If you train really hard, maybe you
can enter the Tenkaichi Tournament, too!

200
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,960
Really? Then again, Trunks-<i>kun</i>
is even more amazing than me.

201
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,800
When we play-fight against
each other, I'm no match for him!

202
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,810
Is that right? So you
guys play together like that?

203
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,810
Uh-huh! It's lots of fun!

204
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:59,940
<i>If I don't watch out, the little</i>
<i>squirts are going to pass right by me.</i>

205
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:11,450
Now listen, answer me truthfully.

206
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,000
You're sayin' there's no way you came
to invite Gohan-<i>chan</i> on a date, right?

207
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,460
I told you I didn't, didn't I?

208
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,750
H-Hey!

209
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,800
Mother, we're home!

210
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,970
Welcome back.

211
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,810
Videl-<i>san</i>, I'm surprised you found this place.

212
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,390
It was easy, if you look at the class rolls.

213
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:34,980
Ah, I see.

214
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,400
Never mind that, what's the meaning of this?

215
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,980
Submitting a notice of
absence from school like that–

216
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,980
You promised me you would
teach me how to fly, right?

217
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,990
U-Uh, of course I'll teach you.

218
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,410
Gohan-<i>chan...</i>

219
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:53,410
Is it true that this girl is enterin'
the Tenkaichi Tournament, too?

220
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,620
I-It's true, Mother. It was from Videl-<i>san</i> here

221
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,080
that I heard about the Tenkaichi
Tournament in the first place.

222
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,880
In that case, all right.

223
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,880
Now don't you go doin' nothin' lewd to Gohan

224
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,600
and tellin' him it's out of thanks!

225
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,970
There's no way I would do that sort of thing!

226
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,320
You!

227
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,730
You're not, by any chance,

228
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:26,320
thinkin' of enterin' the
Tenkaichi Tournament together...

229
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,740
...as an excuse to get
married to Gohan-<i>chan</i>, are you?!

230
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,200
No, I'm not thinking that!

231
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,790
And why would I go to the Tenkaichi Tournament

232
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,750
to get married in the first place?!

233
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:42,540
Well, after all, my mother and father
got married at the Tenkaichi Tournament.

234
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,430
Oh, dear! Goten-<i>chan</i>, how utterly embarrassin'!

235
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,600
W-What a weirdo...

236
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,560
The Tenkaichi Tournament
where I fought Goku-<i>sa...</i>

237
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,780
And then our marriage...

238
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,910
They're all such good memories.

239
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,750
But even so...!

240
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:24,920
When it comes to you and
Gohan-<i>chan</i>, that's another story!

241
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,550
I told you, such a thing happening isn't possible!

242
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,880
Geez, stop saying such foolish things!

243
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,420
What?!

244
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:46,320
<i>Only one month remains</i>
<i>until the Tenkaichi Tournament.</i>

245
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,820
<i>Are you sure you should be</i>
<i>keeping company with Videl, Gohan?</i>

246
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,870
It doesn't look like we'll be able to
train in peace for a while like this, huh?

247
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,330
<i>Then again, as for Goten...</i>

248
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:10,170
<i>For his small size, Goten is sitting on</i>
<i>an incredible amount of latent ability.</i>

249
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,180
<i>I really shouldn't be letting</i>
<i>myself slide like I have been.</i>

250
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,870
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

251
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:45,460
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

252
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:56,050
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

253
00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:02,140
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

254
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,150
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

255
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:14,530
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

256
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,410
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

257
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:27,460
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

258
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,000
<i>Even now?</i>

259
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:36,630
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

260
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:42,060
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

261
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:48,520
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

262
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:58,570
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

263
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,550
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

264
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,010
<i>Awesome! To think that she</i>
<i>would be able to fly after just one day!</i>

265
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,640
<i>This Videl girl really is something else.</i>

266
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,270
<i>Your brother is finding learning</i>
<i>to fly a lot easier, isn't he?</i>

267
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:28,190
<i>I'll be back tomorrow, too,</i>
<i>so make sure you teach me right.</i>

268
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,350
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

269
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:34,230
<i>"Ah, You're Flying!!</i>
<i>Videl's Introduction to Bukujutsu."</i>

270
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:38,150
<i>Aw, I can't do my own training!</i>

271
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,650
"Next time"
"Ah, You're Flying!!
