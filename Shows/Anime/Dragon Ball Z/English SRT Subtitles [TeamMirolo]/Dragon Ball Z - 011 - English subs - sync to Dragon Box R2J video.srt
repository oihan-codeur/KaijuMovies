<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,430
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:52,300

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,000
<i>In the Other World, Goku runs himself</i>

17
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:05,180
<i>Elsewhere, Gohan was enduring some</i>

18
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,380
<i>And, deep in space, the Saiyans</i>
<i>were steadily approaching ever closer</i>

19
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,290
<i>as they headed toward Earth.</i>

20

<i>"The Saiyans, Mightiest</i>

21
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,460
All right, then!

22
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,010
What, you again?
You never learn, do you?

23
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,060
Over here!

24
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,220
Well then, I'll be
taking some meat again!

25
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,500
Your tail is going to disappear before long.

26
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,350
Looks like you've gotten a little bit better.

27
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:41,990
Wow, to think that Kami<i>-sama</i>
is going to be training us!

28
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,990
Damn, I'm just itching all over!

29
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,590
Take it easy, take it easy.

30
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,300
In any case, we have to
find Tenshinhan and Chaozu.

31
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,200
Those two are going to be so surprised!

32
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,270
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>, after you and everyone
else have Kami<i>-sama</i> make you stronger,

33
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,010
those Saiyans will be nothing to you!

34
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:06,250
That's for sure! If you're
coming, then bring it on, Saiyans!

35
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,830
<i>Wake up, Nappa! Wake up!</i>
<i>Open your eyes, Nappa!</i>

36
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,830
Have we arrived at Earth already?

37
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:30,640
No, not yet. I thought we might stop
off on the way, and set my wake-up timer.

38
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,400
Stop off somewhere, you say?

39
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,840
There's a pretty good planet
ahead of us. We can sell it for a lot!

40
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,510
Understood.

41
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:46,690
Sleeping for one year straight gets
you all out of form, so this will be perfect!

42
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,210
W-What is this?

43
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,630
You're sure we can sell a
place like this for a high price?

44
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,260
In any event...

45
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,170
...it looks like we'll need to inspect
this place a little more thoroughly.

46
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,550
What ugly creatures those are!

47
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,320
They look like they're space men.

48
00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:00,060
To think that we would come
across space men on our hunt!

49
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,330
I'm sure that Moai<i>-sama</i> will be pleased!

50
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,430
Moai?

51
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,940
This planet's king! Our ruler!

52
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,040
You've come all the way from
outer space. Stay here for a while!

53
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,190
This will be interesting!

54
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,000
Stop, Nappa.

55
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,200
This could be an opportunity.
Let's let them introduce us to this Moai.

56
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,900
Here...

57
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,470
Don't scare us like that!

58
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,690
Freeze, you bank robber!

59
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,890
You're under arrest!

60
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,660
What pests!

61
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,230
This money is a present for Ten<i>-san</i>!
You guys stay out of it!

62
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,430
Just you wait, Tenshinhan!

63
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,460
I'll feed you all kinds of
nutritious things with this money!

64
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,960
Behave yourselves for a
little while now, space men.

65
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,280
It looks like quite an
enjoyable little planet, huh?

66
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,810
I-It's true! You're space men!
I've never seen any before!

67
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,250
Never mind, he's now finally
started reaching out after space men.

68
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,250
How far is he going
to go before he's satisfied?

69
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,990
You have come to this planet at a bad time.

70
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,860
Ever since Moai has claimed
the throne, things have been crazy.

71
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,030
Everyone in the general
population has become Moai's toys!

72
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:27,230
And as for me, I had my wife
stolen from me on our wedding day!

73
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,710
Do you understand how I feel?

74
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,840
Oh, my adorable Lemuria!

75
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,050
What's the matter, Lemuria?

76
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:42,480
Nothing special...

77
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,250
Don't tell me you're still
thinking about that other man.

78
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,740
Please, stop! Spare me!

79
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,880
L-Let me out!

80
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,050
I beg you! P-Please, I beg you!

81
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,090
D-Don't eat me!
Please! I-I don't want to die!

82
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm bored.

83
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,050
What? You say you've
captured some space men?

84
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,390
Yes.

85
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:03,560
Interesting. Bring them here.
If they're cute, I'll make them my pets.

86
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,430
What is this?

87
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,900
C-Could they be the ones?

88
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,610
I-It's them! How did
they get out of the prison?

89
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,960
I-Incredible...

90
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,500
W-What power those guys have!

91
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,400
What ugly creatures! There's
no way I can keep them as pets.

92
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,670
Right, Lemuria?

93
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,240
Hey, space men! How would
you like to make a wager with me?

94
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,640
Wager?

95
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,610
Have a go at fighting against my warriors.

96
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:59,080
If you win, I'll give you anything you like.

97
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,860
Although, no matter how you look at it,
there's no chance of you beating them.

98
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,830
I'd like to see what kind of
blood is spilled by space men. Go!

99
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:32,020
W-What? What the hell's going on here?

100
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,420
You said you'd give us
anything we liked, right?

101
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,320
In that case...

102
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,600
...we'll take this planet!

103
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,900
What?!

104
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,600
Didn't you hear him? We're
taking this planet, and your lives!

105
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,690
I-Impossible!

106
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,860
Don't you get it yet? We let
ourselves be captured on purpose.

107
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,570
In order for us to be led in here, you see.

108
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,770
Kill them! Cut them to bits!

109
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,050
Ain't I at Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s place yet?!

110
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,930
Yedi! Release Yedi!

111
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:53,090
So this monster is your ace in the hole, huh?

112
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,330
Let them have it, Yedi! Kill those two!

113
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,630
May I?

114
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,640
Suit yourself.

115
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,930
Fool! You intend to test
your strength against Yedi's?!

116
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,890
Y-Yedi!

117
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,290
I'm done playing around!

118
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,230
W-What's this?

119
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:46,300
I-Incredible! You guys are incredible!

120
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,070
You are indeed the
saviors of this planet!

121
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,280
Peace is sure to return to this
planet now, just as it was before!

122
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:14,670
Atla!

123
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,970
L-Lemuria?

124
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:39,030
This is hopeless. We won't be
able to get squat for this planet.

125
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,960
Let's go, Nappa.

126
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,530
Atla!

127
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,710
Get out of my sight,
you good-for-nothing planet!

128
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:09,990
Lemuria!

129
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,160
Atla!

130
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,440
They're beautiful when they're obliterated,
no matter what planet they happen to be.

131
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,660
Still, I hope this Earth turns out to be
a little bit better of a planet than this.

132
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,830
Hey, if it turns out to be
another good-for-nothing planet,

133
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,900
we'll just blow it away too.

134
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,070
After we've gathered those
Dragon Ball things, that is.

135
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,480
Eternal life, huh?
I'm looking forward to that!

136

<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

155
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,800

157
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,980
<i>What's more, that's hell</i>
