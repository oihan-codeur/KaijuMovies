<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:24,880
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,190
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:36,890
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:43,500
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:52,370
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,880
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:04,890
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,360
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,430
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:17,870
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:26,780
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,380
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:37,250
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,160
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,970
<i>Kaio-ken</i> times two!

17
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,830
<i>A times two level Kaio-ken was no</i>
<i>use against the mighty warrior Vegeta.</i>

18
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,210
<i>Ultimately, Goku dared to risk his life</i>
<i>by taking upon himself a times three Kaio-ken.</i>

19
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,980
May my body withstand this!
Times three <i>Kaio-ken!</i>

20
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,600
<i>"Now, Goku! A Final Technique</i>
<i>With Everything On the Line."</i>

21
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,770
<i>Hmm? What is he planning to do?</i>

22
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,130
No! Your body won't be able to
bear it if you go higher than 2x, Goku!

23
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,520
Times three <i>Kaio-ken!</i>

24
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,890
What?!

25
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,180
A-Awesome!

26
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,290
<i>Why, you–!</i>

27
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,620
W-Why, you–!

28
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:45,890
H-He can do this! He just
might be able to beat him!

29
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,930
Goku's fightin' power
readin' has risen, you say?

30
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,440
What on earth is goin' on?

31
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,110
Baba<i>-san</i>, please hurry up
and show us how the fight is going!

32
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,140
How is Gohan? How is Gohan?!

33
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:07,120
I-It's no use! The <i>ki</i> over there is too
strong, and I can't control the power!

34
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,950
You don't suppose Goku has unleashed
some technique he's been saving, do you?

35
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,660
Sure! If that's the case, then...

36
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,930
H-He just might win!

37
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,440
I, on the other hand,
have a bad feeling about this.

38
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:27,640
It's said that the flame of a candle
burns intensely just before it goes out.

39
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,640
It seems to me that Goku is
tremendously overexerting himself.

40
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,980
Don't say anythin' so ill-fated!

41
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,860
<i>I-Impossible! How could his– how could</i>
<i>Kakarrot's battle power be higher than mine?!</i>

42
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,970
Damn... He's a tough one.
If I don't finish this quickly–

43
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,240
Damn! My body can't–!

44
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,810
<i>What're you doin', Goku?! You</i>
<i>should just put him away right here'n now!</i>

45
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,620
H-How can I let this happen?! I am super-elite!

46
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,660
There's no way I should be
beaten by that lower-class warrior!

47
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,930
I... I am...

48
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,560
I am the greatest in the universe!

49
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,800
<i>My whole body is aching!</i>

50
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,570
<i>Sure enough, it looks like performing</i>
<i>a times three Kaio-ken was asking too much...</i>

51
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,110
<i>If I dally around, I'll be</i>
<i>the one who goes down first!</i>

52
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,750
Blood?

53
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,760
I had my noble blood shed over
fighting a piece of trash like that?

54
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:10,170
This will not stand! This
absolutely... absolutely will not stand!

55
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,300
I don't need this planet anymore!

56
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,980
I'm going to crush you,
along with the rest of the Earth!

57
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,790
You're going to what?!

58
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,320
Go ahead and try to dodge this, if you can!

59
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,160
Even if you spare yourself,
the Earth will be blown to pieces!

60
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,330
Dammit, he thought this through!

61
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,340
I ain't got no choice but to risk it!

62
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:03,180
Times three <i>Kaio-ken...</i>

63
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:08,720
...Kamehame<i>-Ha!</i>

64
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,000
Ka... me...

65
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,340
ha...

66
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,380
There's absolutely no way
you can stop my <i>Gyallic Ho</i> blast!

67
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,870
me...

68
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,400
Let you and the Earth
together turn to space dust!

69
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,740
Damn it, man! If I hafta die like this,
I should've eaten more meaty buns!

70
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,880
<i>Ha!</i>

71
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,300
W-What?! It's just like my <i>Gyallic Ho</i>!

72
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,010
Yow, that's hot!

73
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,220
What is this?

74
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,820
T-The power of the <i>ki</i>
from Goku and that other guy

75
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,350
is manifesting itself through the crystal ball!

76
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,090
<i>Kaio-ken...</i> times four!

77
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,460
No! Goku!

78
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,670
H-He's pushing back–

79
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,840
M-My body!

80
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,910
H-He did it... He did it!

81
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,910
Son! You did it, didn'cha?!

82
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,250
You bastard!

83
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:22,520
Yajirobe? What are you doing here?

84
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,020
What, you hadn't noticed?

85
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,720
For someone as good as you are,
ya sure fought desperately, huh?

86
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,390
I guess so.

87
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,490
Still, you done a good job
of blowin' that wicked guy away.

88
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,630
You sure are one helluva dude.

89
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,070
W-What? What's the matter?

90
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,010
I used a technique that was
too much for my body to take...

91
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,410
Well, it wasn't nothin' normal, all right.

92
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,420
More importantly, Yajirobe,
you'd better get out of here.

93
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,620
H-How come?

94
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,850
D-Don't tell me!

95
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:00,090
He's still alive.

96
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:04,290
If that's all it would have taken for him
to die, there wouldn't be any challenge.

97
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:09,900
S-Still, there's no problem, right?
You're stronger'n him, ain'cha?

98
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,600
Like I told you, I overdid it, and now my
body is in shambles. I could be near my limit.

99
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,240
O-Oh, yeah?

100
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,080
Well, then...

101
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,640
H-Hang in there!

102
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,540
Dammit!

103
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,410
Why?! Why is Kakarrot's
battle power higher than mine?!

104
00:15:53,450 --> 00:16:00,220
Damn it to hell! I am a Saiyan! I am
the strongest in the entire universe!

105
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,860
At this point, as much as I dislike
how ugly it is, I'm using my last resort.

106
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,530
I'll transform into a Great Ape, and crush him!

107
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:17,500
The strength of my Great
Ape form is nothing to sneeze at!

108
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,640
Damn it all, we chose the day
of the full moon to come here,

109
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,310
so we could wipe out the
people on this planet quickly.

110
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,840
To think that I would have to transform
just to defeat Kakarrot– it's infuriating!

111
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,820
That's strange. The
moon should be out by now...

112
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:47,430
<i>Saiyan, no matter how hard you look,</i>
<i>it won't do any good. The moon is gone.</i>

113
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,540
<i>The one named Piccolo feared this</i>
<i>might happen, and eliminated it long ago.</i>

114
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,210
<i>Still, Son Goku can't</i>
<i>have very much energy left.</i>

115
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,840
<i>Even if the Saiyan</i>
<i>doesn't turn into a Great Ape,</i>

116
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,210
<i>it doesn't change the</i>
<i>fact that he's still in a pinch.</i>

117
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,410
<i>Then again, he's become</i>
<i>weaker, too. The Genki Dama!</i>

118
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:11,690
<i>If you can just hit him with a Genki Dama,</i>
<i>the way he is now, you can beat him for sure!</i>

119
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:28,840
<i>That's strange. He's just</i>
<i>going around in circles up there.</i>

120
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,070
<i>Why ain't he coming at me?</i>

121
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,510
It's not here! It's not here! It's not here!

122
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,150
Dammit, the moon isn't
anywhere! What's going on!?

123
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,620
So that's it! Dammit! He is one
thoroughly aggravating bastard!

124
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,220
Kakarrot must have taken out the
moon ahead of time! Then it's unavoidable...

125
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,670
My battle power might drop somewhat,
but there doesn't seem to be any other way.

126
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,770
I can't wait to see the look
of stunned panic on his face!

127
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,240
He's finally coming back down.

128
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,480
<i>The only way I can beat</i>
<i>him is with the Genki Dama.</i>

129
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,790
<i>Am I going to be able to</i>
<i>mentally focus myself for that?</i>

130
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,490
Kakarrot...

131
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,930
You might have thought you could outwit me
by getting rid of the moon, but it won't work!

132
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,260
The moon?

133
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,100
What are you talking about?

134
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,500
As if you didn't know! Are you aware of
why we can transform during a full moon?

135
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,100
Transform?

136
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,840
The light from the moon is
what gets reflected from the sun.

137
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,280
Sunlight contains Bruits waves only
when it is reflected back by the moon.

138
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,820
During a full moon, those Bruits waves
reach a level of over seventeen million zeno.

139
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,260
What is he talking about?

140
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,430
When over seventeen million zeno's worth
of Bruits waves are absorbed by our eyes,

141
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,100
it triggers a reaction in our tails,

142
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,040
and our transformation begins!

143
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,840
A limited number of Saiyans are
able to create an artificial full moon

144
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,540
that emits over seventeen million zeno.

145
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:17,110
Things are not going to go as you expected!
Even if you have eliminated the moon,

146
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,680
by mixing this planet's
oxygen with my Power Ball...

147
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,060
Sorry to keep you waiting, Kakarrot.

148
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,530
The time of your death has finally come.

149
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:40,500
A lower-class warrior like you should
not have challenged a super-elite to battle!

150
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,540
<i>The moment that strange light</i>
<i>started glowing, his ki dropped.</i>

151
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,670
<i>What the hell is he</i>
<i>planning to go this far to do?</i>

152
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,360
What?!

153
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,630
Burst open and blend together!

154
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,450
What is that?

155
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,260
What?! What have you done?!

156
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,630
I-It can't be! He's created a moon!

157
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:51,810
You're going to regret
losing your tail, Kakarrot!

158
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,130
Is this the end?

159
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,280
W-What's that?

160
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,390
<i>Transforming himself into a Great Ape,</i>

161
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,060
<i>Vegeta resorts to the</i>
<i>final measure available to him.</i>

162
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,440
<i>Does Goku have any chance of beating him?</i>

163
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,220
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

164
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:54,100
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

165
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,470
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

166
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,940
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

167
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,450
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

168
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,550
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

169
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,020
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

170
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,690
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

171
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:29,230
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

172
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,300
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

173
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,140
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

174
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,210
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

175
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:44,880
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

176
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,050
<i>So sorry.</i>

177
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,150
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

178
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,130
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

179
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,910
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

180
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,180
<i>Damn, now I ain't even got</i>
<i>enough strength left to blow my nose.</i>

181
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,520
<i>This is the end for you, Kakarrot!</i>

182
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:26,190
<i>Each of you, share with me just</i>
<i>a little bit of your Genki energy!</i>

183
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,190
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

184
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,790
<i>"Battle Power Times Ten!!</i>
<i>Vegeta's Great Metamorphosis."</i>

185
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,960
<i>Father won't be beaten!</i>

186
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,830
"Next time"
"Battle Power Times Ten!!
Vegeta's Great Metamorphosis"
