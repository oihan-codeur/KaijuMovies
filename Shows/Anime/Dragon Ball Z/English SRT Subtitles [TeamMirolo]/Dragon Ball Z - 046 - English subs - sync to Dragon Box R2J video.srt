3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

14

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,930
<i>Gohan and the others,</i>
<i>seeking a new set of Dragon Balls,</i>

17
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,960
<i>had at last arrived on Planet Namek.</i>

18
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,240
<i>However, Vegeta had also come to</i>
<i>Planet Namek to look for the Dragon Balls.</i>

19
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>Further, the evil wire-puller</i>
<i>Freeza and his men were also there.</i>

20
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,860
There is a reading of around
ten Namekians in that direction.

21
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,190
Very well.

22
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,230
It would be nice if they
had the fifth Dragon Ball.

23
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,000
Let us be going.

24
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,310
<i>The circumstances surrounding the</i>
<i>Dragon Balls had taken a sudden turn.</i>

25
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:45,280
<i>Will Gohan and the others be</i>
<i>able to get hold of the Dragon Balls?</i>

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,660
<i>"Goku's Power Unleashed!!</i>
<i>Six Days to the Far End of the Galaxy."</i>

27
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,670
A <i>ki</i>! There's another unknown
<i>ki</i> coming this way from over there!

28
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,310
Hide! Gohan! Bulma<i>-san</i>!

29
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,980
W-What, now?

30
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,580
Come on, hurry!

31
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,520
What in the world is it?

32
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,820
I'm always impressed by
how you guys know these things.

33
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,590
Shh! Keep quiet. It's coming this way.

34
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,790
Could we have been discovered?

35
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:31,890
I don't know.

36
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,840
They're here!

37
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,250
T-They're gone.

38
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,720
Thank goodness. It looks like those
people weren't coming after us, huh?

39
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,250
B-But, what exactly was that about just now?

40
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,100
What's the matter with you guys?

41
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:50,870
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>, could you check
something with the Dragon Radar?

42
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,570
W-What?

43
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,280
W-When you examined it before, there
were four Dragon Balls together, right?

44
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,720
What are they doing now?

45
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,060
All right, I'll check.

46
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,720
All four of them are moving. Which means...

47
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,130
R-Right, no doubt about it. Those guys
just now had the four Dragon Balls with them.

48
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,470
I-I knew it.

49
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,900
You don't say.

50
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,240
Gohan!

51
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,570
Yes?

52
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,880
Gohan, did you see him? The weird
one, flying second from the front?

53
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,310
Yes. I sensed an incredible power from him.

54
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,920
The moment I saw him, I froze.

55
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,290
That guy might be even more
ridiculously powerful than Vegeta.

56
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,260
I-It looked like there were
some other amazing guys in there,

57
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,930
but that guy was in a whole different league.

58
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,300
Stronger than Vegeta?
It couldn't be! Just who is he?

59
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,300
I-I don't know, but
I think he's one of Vegeta's pals.

60
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,670
They were all wearing the same kind of outfits.

61
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,950
Dammit! How are we supposed to get
the Dragon Balls away from those guys?!

62
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,680
H-Hey, look at this.

63
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,850
That group just now is
heading toward another Dragon Ball.

64
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,850
What's going on? Do they have radar, too?

65
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,090
What's the location?

66
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:18,430
About fourteen kilometers in that direction.

67
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,300
That's where we sensed that <i>ki</i>
Kuririn<i>-san</i> said could be Namekians!

68
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,870
I'm going to go over
there and see what's going on.

69
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm going with you!

70
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,470
J-Just a minute, now!

71
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,510
Are you planning on
leaving me here all by myself?!

72
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,350
It's a lot safer staying here
than moving around carelessly.

73
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,880
W-When you put it that way, you're right.

74
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,890
Okay then, I'll put up a house with my
Capsules inside this cave and wait for you.

75
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,960
Okay, please do.

76
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,230
Come back soon, okay?

77
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,160
Remember, Gohan, keep your <i>ki</i>
as suppressed as you can, but hurry.

78
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,230
You can do that, right?

79
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,230
Yes.

80
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,260
All right!

81
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,080
They're gone. I wonder
if they'll really be okay.

82
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,050
Oh, that's right! I need to contact Earth!

83
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,240
Oh, okay, okay, okay...

84
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,840
Hello? Oh, Bulma... Yeah,
I was just heading to the hospital...

85
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,440
What?

86
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,350
Doctor, can't I have
your permission to train yet?

87
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,360
Are you still goin' on about that?!

88
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,230
I told you, bed rest is the
best thing for you right now.

89
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:03,230
If I don't start training soon,
my body is going to go soft.

90
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,200
How are you doing, Goku?

91
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,200
Old Timer!

92
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,770
Oh, Doctor, hello there.
Uh, is Chichi around, too?

93
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,380
Does me bein' here make
things inconvenient for you?

94
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,250
Oh, no, no, no, I wouldn't say that...

95
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:23,790
I'm goin' to go do some laundry.

96
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,150
Ah, thank goodness.

97
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,430
As it happens, I just received a
message from Bulma and the others.

98
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,400
Not again!

99
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,430
Oh, my, no, what a
naughty hand! Sorry 'bout that.

100
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,440
So, are Gohan and them okay?

101
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,840
Ah, they did indeed arrive on
Planet Namek safely. However,

102
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,750
Gohan and the others weren't the
only ones who went to Planet Namek.

103
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,320
That Saiyan, Vegeta, has gone there, too.

104
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,720
Vegeta?! He's there?!

105
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,120
That's not all. In addition to Vegeta,

106
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,760
there are dozens of his
buddies there on Planet Namek.

107
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,130
Those guys wrecked the
spaceship they went there in,

108
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,160
so they can't get back to Earth.

109
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,530
W-What?!

110
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:15,340
What's more, at least one of them
has a <i>ki</i> that's even greater than Vegeta's.

111
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,010
That can't be... Someone with
a <i>ki</i> even greater than Vegeta?

112
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,350
Hey, you still alive?

113
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,790
What's this? After I went to
all the trouble of comin' here,

114
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,360
ya don't look to happy to see me.

115
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,360
The senzu beans're finally ready.
There's just a few of 'em, though.

116
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,200
But Karin<i>-sama</i> said to take all seven of 'em.

117
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,800
Wow, all right! That's what you call
good timing! Hurry and let me have one!

118
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,670
N-Now look, you, you can't go
giving strange foods to patients!

119
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,370
Here ya go.

120
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,290
I've been waiting for this moment!

121
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,270
Here it is, here it is. Kaio<i>-sama</i>
sent this new gi to me for just this day.

122
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,340
All right! I'm off to Planet Namek!

123
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,750
Oh, thanks. I'm taking
the rest of the senzu with me.

124
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,090
H-How are you planning to get to Planet Namek?

125
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,250
When Bulma's daddy
came to visit me here earlier,

126
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:42,790
I asked him to make me
a spaceship, just in case.

127
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:46,230
A spaceship? You mean like Kami<i>-sama</i>'s?

128
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,100
That one was made from
stuff that ain't found on Earth,

129
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,730
so even Bulma's daddy
said he couldn't do that.

130
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,140
Well, then–?

131
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,440
When I thought hard about it,

132
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,280
I realized there were still two
Saiyan spaceships here on Earth.

133
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,780
The spaceship that my brother came here in,

134
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,720
and the spaceship that
I myself came to Earth in as a kid.

135
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,120
T-That's right!

136
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,720
I had Bulma's daddy go looking for
them, and while my brother's was blown up,

137
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,260
mine was from long ago,
so it was still all right.

138
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,300
I'm having him repair and rebuild it.

139
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,770
Kinto Un!

140
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,110
Okay, I'll be back later.

141
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,280
Um...

142
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,280
I'm off to Bulma's house!

143
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,320
Ah! Goku<i>-sa</i>!

144
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,450
Hey! Where are you goin'?!

145
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,460
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

146
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,330
So, where's he going?

147
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,000
Hmm, well, as it turns out...

148
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,210
With things's bad as you're saying
they are, what's that guy so happy for?

149
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,210
I guess it has to be his Saiyan blood.
Of course, he wants to save everyone,

150
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,390
but more than anything, he seems
thrilled to be able to fight someone so strong.

151
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:22,790
That guy sure ain't normal,
all right. I can't take being around him.

152
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,460
Idiot. It's obvious he's
got zero chance of winning.

153
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,700
<i>I can't believe it. How could there be</i>
<i>anyone even more incredible than Vegeta?</i>

154
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,430
Gohan, your <i>ki</i> is a little too
strong. Suppress it a little more.

155
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,460
Right.

156
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,260
Huh?

157
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,460
Goku<i>-chan</i>!

158
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,460
Ah, Bulma's mommy.

159
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,070
Oh, my, are you all better now?

160
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,900
As fit as you see me.

161
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,070
By the way, is the reconstruction on
the spaceship that I asked for finished?

162
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,380
Well, I'm not sure. It looked like
he was still working on something.

163
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:53,210
He ain't done yet? That's a problem...

164
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,280
It's in the inner yard. Let's go there.

165
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,220
You know, I never thought that little
Goku<i>-chan</i> would grow up to be so handsome.

166
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,790
Say, let's date sometime, okay, okay?

167
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,830
I-I have to beat that
Saiyan before I can do that...

168
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,830
You're so busy, aren't you?

169
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,840
Oh, right, I discovered this
terribly delicious cake shop not long ago,

170
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
and it's all thanks to you, Goku<i>-chan.</i>

171
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,440
If the Earth had been lost, I wouldn't have been
able to eat any of it. Thank goodness for that.

172
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,850
I guess so.

173
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,250
Dear, Goku<i>-chan</i> is here!

174
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,820
I-Is this...

175
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,190
...my spaceship?

176
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,060
It's huge!

177
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,270
Oh, Goku, you're better already?

178
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:49,440
Yeah, thanks to a senzu. This is mine, right?

179
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,370
Is it true it ain't finished yet?

180
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,810
Yeah, there's still a little bit
left on it. Well, come on in and see.

181
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,810
Okay, I'll go get us something to drink.

182
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,250
Thanks.

183
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,790
This is incredible! I'm surprised
that teeny spaceship has become this.

184
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:12,360
Nothing to it. Everything is as you ordered.

185
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,360
I can train just fine like this.

186
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,800
I took great pains. It was
hard to find your spaceship.

187
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,370
It was broken into little pieces, you know.

188
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,210
Still, lucky for us,

189
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,380
the important parts were left
intact, but I had to rebuild most of it.

190
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,410
My spaceship was in pieces?!

191
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,250
That's strange. I wonder if
I busted it when I was a kid.

192
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,660
You know, this Saiyan
science is absolutely amazing.

193
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,430
Huh? Um, where is the
artificial gravity device thing?

194
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,200
Oh, this is it over here.

195
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,170
Wow, this thing, huh?

196
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,740
Let's see, this is the switch.

197
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,600
This is the controller.

198
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,740
As you ordered, it can generate
at most 100 Gs worth of gravity,

199
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,340
but even for you, isn't that a bit reckless?

200
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,180
At 100 Gs, after all, if you weigh
60 kilos, that will become 6,000 kilos.

201
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,190
That's six tons.
Ordinarily, that would kill you.

202
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,190
That's okay. If I don't
train someplace like that,

203
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,790
I won't be able to beat that Saiyan.

204
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,400
So, can't this thing fly yet?

205
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,800
It can fly anywhere you want to.
Even to the ends of the universe.

206
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,800
Huh? Then...

207
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,410
Uh, the bathroom, kitchen and
bedroom are down that ladder...

208
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,210
Say, then what still ain't done yet?

209
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,380
I can't quite settle on the
placement for the stereo speakers.

210
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,220
As long as you're listening to it,
you want it to sound good, don't you?

211
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,390
T-That's all?! When you say it
ain't finished, is that all you mean?!

212
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,220
"Is that all?"

213
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,030
When you consider reverberations
and everything, it's quite difficult.

214
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,770
I-I don't care where the stereo is placed!
I'm in a hurry here! I'll leave right now!

215
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,770
What are you in such a rush for?

216
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,440
We got a message from Bulma,
and anyhow, I just have to hurry!

217
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,180
Tell me how to make this thing fly, quickly!

218
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,350
All right. Now, you're sure
about the placement of the stereo?

219
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:13,310
Uh-huh!

220
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:19,150
The data has all been input. All you
have to do is give the switch a little boi-oing,

221
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,160
and six days later, you
will arrive on Planet Namek.

222
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,400
Six days? I can get there in
just six days? That's awesome!

223
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,330
Is it true that Goku is here?!

224
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,200
Yes. He's looking at the
spaceship in the inner yard right now.

225
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,040
Huh?

226
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,860
Let's see... after that
comes this button, right?

227
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,950
Ho, for as hurriedly as I put that together...

228
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,750
...it actually flew.

229
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,590
Huh? Where's Goku?

230
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,390
He left in a hurry.

231
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,590
I wonder if he's really okay with the stereo...

232
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,540
Close... we're close. Cut your
<i>ki</i> completely. Let's walk our way in.

233
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,980
Right.

234
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:59,760
They're on the other side of that bluff.

235
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,970
What an incredible <i>ki</i>!

236
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,140
This is bad! We've come
up right in front of them!

237
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,570
Let's move around to the other side.

238
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,770
Right.

239
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:37,730
Those houses are just like the
spaceship that we came here in.

240
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:42,160
What are they doing? Those other guys aside,

241
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:47,140
those three–especially the one in
the middle, riding in that round vehicle–

242
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,670
each have a terrifyingly strong <i>ki.</i>

243
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,650
I can tell.

244
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,180
Look at what the two guys on
either side have in their hands!

245
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,910
They're Dragon Balls!

246
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,650
H-Huge Dragon Balls...

247
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,460
Is something the matter, Dodoria<i>-san</i>?

248
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,100
No, there was just a slight
power reading coming from that cliff.

249
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,200
It is gone now, though. It must
have been a small animal or insect.

250
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,690
Y-Yikes, yikes! They very nearly spotted us!

251
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,550
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, we have only found five of them.

252
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,160
The remaining others
appear to be out at the moment.

253
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,500
Get out here, now, unless you want to die!

254
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,480
He looks just like Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

255
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,950
T-They're Namekians!

256
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,040
Wow, this certainly is fast.

257
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,510
Outer space sure is dark, huh? Or maybe
it's just nighttime out here right now.

258
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,080
Well, never mind. I've got
to start training right away.

259
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,510
I'm glad it's only going
to take six days to get there,

260
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,650
but I've got to surpass that
Vegeta guy before then, too.

261
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,190
Let's see, as I remember,

262
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,720
Kaio<i>-sama</i> said that his world
had ten-times gravity, didn't he?

263
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,630
For the time being, I guess I
should get used to around twenty-times.

264
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,980
It's working, all right!

265
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,750
<i>At last, Goku had blasted off into space.</i>

266
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,120
<i>However, the Dragon Balls were falling</i>
<i>into Freeza's hands, one after the next.</i>

267
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,970
<i>Is Goku's power about to be unleashed?</i>

268
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,320
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

269
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,150
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

270
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,530
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

271
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,030
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

272
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,540
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

273
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,640
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

274
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,150
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

275
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,810
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

276
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:28,330
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

277
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,390
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

278
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,200
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

279
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,230
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

280
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,900
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

281
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,070
<i>So sorry.</i>

282
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,210
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

283
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,220
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

284
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,230
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

285
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,040
<i>Father, come quickly!</i>
<i>The Namekians are in trouble!</i>

286
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:25,080
<i>My wish is to obtain eternal</i>
<i>life with the Dragon Balls.</i>

287
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,010
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

288
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,890
<i>"Surprise Attack!!</i>
<i>The Elder's Target Was the Scouters."</i>

289
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:34,630
<i>Freeza, you are such a terrible person!</i>

290
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,890
"Next time"
"Surprise Attack!!
The Elder's Target Was the Scouters"
