3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:54,405

<i>Doctor Gero is killed by the hand</i>

19
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:51,435
<i>Vegeta, having transformed</i>

21
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:05,875
<i>"Good Looks and Super Power!?</i>
<i>No Blind Spot on No. 18."</i>

22
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:26,235
You should have kept your place.

23
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,865
Very well. I'll do it.

24
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:34,845
Let me warn you now,

25
00:03:34,885 --> 00:03:37,645
I won't be pulling any punches
just because you're a woman.

26
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:42,455
Then again, you're an Artificial Human.
You aren't a woman, are you?

27
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:31,505
Here!

28
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:58,155
Surprising.

29
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:00,965
He's got a much greater strength...

30
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:03,865
...than in the information
Doctor Gero provided us.

31
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,635
Vegeta, huh?

32
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:09,475
Not too bad.

33
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:39,235
Looks like No. 18 is starting to play with him.

34
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:51,845
Hey, stackin' this way's
awfully rough on me, ain't it?

35
00:05:51,885 --> 00:05:55,545
Please, just hang in there for
a little while longer, Yajirobe<i>-san.</i>

36
00:05:55,585 --> 00:06:00,025
Enough! Can't you do anything but complain?

37
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:03,055
How can you ask a question like that?

38
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:09,425
My belly's so empty!
I gotta put away some chow!

39
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:13,905
Incredible. You have no class.

40
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:19,075
Yeah, he's such a poor example for you–huh?

41
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:31,855
Hey! This ain't funny!

42
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:34,025
Which one of us ain't got class now?

43
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:37,825
Please, stop shifting around there, Yajirobe<i>-san</i>!

44
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:42,595
You hush! I'm gettin' off!
Take us down! Take us down!

45
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,265
Whoa!

46
00:07:01,825 --> 00:07:03,455
You're not getting away!

47
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:27,105
What'm I s'pposed to do now?

48
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:42,925
<i>I sure hope the Artificial Humans</i>
<i>haven't overtaken Gohan and Bulma-san.</i>

49
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,295
<i>Dad...</i>

50
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,615
What's that?

51
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:24,035
What's the matter?

52
00:08:24,075 --> 00:08:26,065
Have you stopped running from me?

53
00:08:35,685 --> 00:08:38,845
You guys are just fooling, right?

54
00:08:58,675 --> 00:09:00,665
Huh? What the–?

55
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,465
They've come back.

56
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:41,475
There's no way I can tell if you
wind-up mannequins suffer damage or not.

57
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:50,855
As such, I'll just have to blow you to pieces.

58
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:53,455
Enough so that you'll never smile again.

59
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,075
Hey, you numbskulls!

60
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:12,635
What do you think you're
doing in the middle of the road?

61
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:14,405
Blithering halfwits!

62
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:18,285
If you don't get out of the way,
I'll run right over the top of you!

63
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:22,615
Just keep smiling, while you're still able.

64
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,055
Hey, didn't you hear me?!

65
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,855
Go ahead, try it.

66
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:31,855
Hey!

67
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:12,465
It looks as though you're faster than I thought.

68
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:44,965
Yoo-hoo!

69
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,205
Hello!

70
00:11:57,155 --> 00:12:00,585
Hey there! Hey there!

71
00:12:01,885 --> 00:12:03,855
So bouncy, bouncy!

72
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:06,155
So jiggly, jiggly!

73
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:09,755
Oh, for a camera!

74
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:13,125
It's been so long!

75
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:16,795
Hi! Turtle<i>-chan</i>!

76
00:12:18,175 --> 00:12:20,235
Hi!

77
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:25,575
No, not you, old man!

78
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:31,115
Turtle<i>-chan</i>! Turtle<i>-chan</i>!

79
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:33,145
Turtle<i>-chan</i>?

80
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:39,595
How cute!

81
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:47,155
Why, you...

82
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:10,115
You haven't been giving me your all, have you?

83
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:12,115
Of course not.

84
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:15,755
If I gave it my all, it would destroy the Earth.

85
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,955
I haven't been giving it my all, either.

86
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:21,125
Could you tell?

87
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:22,965
In that case, don't hold back.

88
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:25,765
You'd better give me your best while you can,

89
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,135
or you'll regret it later.

90
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,575
Well then, I will.

91
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:54,155
Are you all right, Vegeta<i>-san</i>?!

92
00:15:07,275 --> 00:15:09,175
Vegeta<i>-san</i>!

93
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:14,975
Unbelievable. You're such a bunch of pests!

94
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:20,175
You guys think you're any help
against an opponent like this?

95
00:15:21,785 --> 00:15:23,755
My goodness.

96
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:25,785
Could it be time to lend a hand?

97
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:31,825
Not even No. 18 would
be able to take them all on.

98
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:34,125
Nothing left for me but to get in there.

99
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:37,765
Unless, No. 16, you want to go?

100
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:41,135
No, I'm not going.

101
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:45,775
Not going, huh? You really are slipshod.

102
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:50,145
Just what were you built for, anyhow?

103
00:15:50,185 --> 00:15:55,115
I thought I told you. To kill Son Goku.

104
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:59,145
My, my, how nice for you to be so carefree.

105
00:16:02,225 --> 00:16:06,965
Hey, No. 17 is headed this way.

106
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,965
Let's get out of here, Vegeta<i>-san.</i>

107
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:11,535
If you get killed, your
pride won't be worth crap.

108
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,195
P-Please!

109
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:18,135
You want another beating?
You're in our way! Get lost, now!

110
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,545
If you want to run, you're free to do so.

111
00:16:20,585 --> 00:16:24,775
We don't have any interest in that which flees.

112
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:26,545
Don't be ridiculous.

113
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:31,785
Why should I find it necessary to
run when I'm about to obliterate you?

114
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,515
Get this straight.

115
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:38,025
If it comes down to fighting
alongside Earthlings, or Namekians...

116
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:41,795
...or Kakarrot, for that matter...

117
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:45,365
...I'd rather fight by myself and die!

118
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:59,215
Very nice commentary.

119
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:00,745
Coupled with your fighting style,

120
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:04,015
you're every bit worthy
to be prince of the Saiyans.

121
00:17:05,895 --> 00:17:10,555
It's not up to you wind-up dolls to say so.

122
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:13,035
Particularly a kid like you.

123
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:19,095
However, in the hopes that each
of you hold the code of <i>Bushido</i> dear,

124
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:22,205
I'm putting you on notice.

125
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:24,735
I don't think anyone here...

126
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:28,205
...would interfere in Vegeta
and No. 18's one-on-one fight,

127
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:35,215
but if you do, I will have to join in as well.

128
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,755
These guys are cowardly pacifists.

129
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:41,155
You don't have to trouble
yourself for them to stay out of it.

130
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,595
Fine, then.

131
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,865
Shall we keep going?

132
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,565
Of course we will!

133
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,335
That's my boy!

134
00:18:31,815 --> 00:18:35,745
You're getting me irritated,
pretending like nothing's happened.

135
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:37,575
You surprise me.

136
00:18:37,615 --> 00:18:42,285
Even being an alien, I didn't
think any man could push me this far.

137
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:46,815
Is the man Son Goku even stronger?

138
00:18:46,855 --> 00:18:48,125
Don't be absurd.

139
00:18:48,165 --> 00:18:51,825
He may have pulled ahead for a
while, but now, as it should be...

140
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,825
...I'm stronger than he is.

141
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:59,765
You don't say. Then you're not
all that great, either one of you.

142
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,005
W-What was that?!

143
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,585
This is bad! Go get her!

144
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:28,165
<i>Incredible. I hadn't realized</i>
<i>that Dad was so incredible.</i>

145
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:33,535
<i>He's actually holding his own against</i>
<i>one of those terrible Artificial Humans.</i>

146
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:42,205
He's going to get killed. Vegeta, I mean.

147
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:44,215
Watch!

148
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,745
It's just a little bit each time,

149
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,585
but the Artificial Human is
starting to get the upper hand.

150
00:19:56,265 --> 00:19:59,355
His opponent hardly loses any power,

151
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:04,025
but for every move Vegeta makes,
his stamina drops proportionately.

152
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,975
Shoot!

153
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:34,125
<i>Goku, what should we do?!</i>

154
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:02,585
Dad!!

155
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:05,015
No, you fool!

156
00:22:06,855 --> 00:22:08,985
<i>Vegeta is in trouble.</i>

157
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:12,325
<i>Without thinking, Trunks leaps to his aid.</i>

158
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:18,165
<i>However, how should they do</i>
<i>battle against the Artificial Humans...</i>

159
00:22:18,205 --> 00:22:22,165
<i>...and their unmeasurable power?</i>

160
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:48,695
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

161
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:54,535
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

162
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,905
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

163
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:05,405
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

164
00:23:07,725 --> 00:23:11,915
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

165
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:16,025
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

166
00:23:16,065 --> 00:23:19,525
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

167
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,165
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

168
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

169
00:23:31,915 --> 00:23:33,775
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

170
00:23:33,815 --> 00:23:35,575
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

171
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:39,615
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

172
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:45,285
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

173
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,455
<i>So sorry.</i>

174
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:52,595
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

175
00:23:55,335 --> 00:24:00,605
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

176
00:24:12,615 --> 00:24:14,685
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

177
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:17,485
<i>How can Trunks–as a Super Saiyan–</i>

178
00:24:17,525 --> 00:24:20,355
<i>be completely knocked out with one blow?!</i>

179
00:24:20,395 --> 00:24:23,785
<i>How disappointing. This isn't much of a game.</i>

180
00:24:23,825 --> 00:24:27,525
<i>Is this the extent of what</i>
<i>flesh-and-blood people can do?</i>

181
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:29,595
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

182
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:33,365
<i>"Nobody Is Able to Stop Them...</i>
<i>Is This the End of the Z Warriors?"</i>

183
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,345
<i>At this rate, everyone will be killed!</i>

184
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,315
"Next time"
"Nobody Is Able to Stop Them...
Is This the End of the Z Warriors?"
