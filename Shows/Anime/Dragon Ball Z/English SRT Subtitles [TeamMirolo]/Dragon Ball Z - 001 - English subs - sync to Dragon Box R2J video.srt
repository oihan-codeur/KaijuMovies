Goku<i>-sa</i>, where's Gohan?

30
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,320
I'm famished already!

31
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,290
What are you talkin' about?
Have you seen Gohan<i>-chan</i>?

32
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,920
Huh? I ain't seen him.

33
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,790
Where could he have gone off to?

34
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,960
If you don't eat and get out of here soon,

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,290
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i> and the others
will grow impatient waitin' for you.

36
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,300
All right, I'll go look for him.

37
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,430
I don't think he's gone too far off.

38
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,600
Right. Leave it to me!

39
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,410
I'm countin' on you!

40
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,250
Really, what am I goin' to do with that boy?

41
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,490
Just a little bit more now...

42
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,430
W-What was that just now?!
A meteor?! A UFO?!

43
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,640
How's about I go look?

44
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,590
Okay, now...

45
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,470
Ah, that's no meteor! What in tarnation is it?

46
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,840
Huh?

47
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,150
So, the folks on this planet
are still alive after all, huh?

48
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,180
That miserable Kakarrot!

49
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,120
W-Who are you?!

50
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,200
Your battle power is a
mere five, huh? Piece of trash!

51
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,300
D-Don't come no closer!
I-I'll kill you!

52
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:53,190
Hmph. What a fragile people.

53
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,770
There's somebody with a great
power around. Range: 4,880.

54
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,760
Is that you, Kakarrot?!

55
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,360
Father! Father!

56
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,960
Father!

57
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,100
Hello there, butterfly!

58
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,570
Wait!

59
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,250
You're way over there...

60
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,590
All right!

61
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,570
<i>Play dead!</i>

62
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,110
My hat?

63
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,750
Father gave that to me!

64
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,510
Hey, Gohan!

65
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:25,850
Father! Mother!

66
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,680
What a nice headdress!

67
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,420
You sure are pretty.

68
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,250
My name is Son Gohan.

69
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,600
Wait!

70
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,710
Mother! Father!

71
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,810
Hey, you, about that hat...

72
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,630
That belongs to my son, Gohan.

73
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,830
Where did you come by it?

74
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,610
Where did you come by it?!

75
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,120
Father! Mother!

76
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:43,290
Gohan!

77
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,570
Gohan!

78
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,670
It's Father!

79
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,840
Just wait there!
I'm coming to save you now!

80
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,880
Gohan!

81
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,850
A little farther!

82
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,230
Father!

83
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,070
Gohan!

84
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:40,750
Father! Mother!

85
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,530
Father!

86
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:05,480
Gohan!

87
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,960
All right...

88
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm scared!

89
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,910
I'm scared! I can't get down! I'm scared!

90
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:47,280
Father, that was scary!
That was so scary!

91
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,290
Gohan, did you–?

92
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,870
I-I don't know.

93
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,810
Gohan, let's go home!
Your mommy is worried!

94
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,440
We have to go to Old Timer Turtle
Hermit's place right away too, you know!

95
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,210
That lousy Kakarrot!

96
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,220
W-What kind of power is this?
It couldn't possibly be...

97
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,920
Son Goku?!

98
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,440
No, it's not!

99
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,650
You're not Kakarrot.

100
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,550
Who are you? Do you have
some sort of business with me?

101
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,220
I don't have any
business with the likes of you.

102
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,030
Then what have you come here for?
Do you want to die?

103
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,730
You sure are in high spirits.

104
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:50,340
Ho... Battle power 322.
So, there are folks like you around, huh?

105
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,740
However, you are still no match for me.

106
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,220
What did you say?! Do you know
who it is you're talking to here?!

107
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,320
Not really...

108
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,820
<i>W-What is the deal with this guy's power?</i>

109
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,140
That was a worthless technique, huh?

110
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,580
Is merely kicking up dust all it can do?

111
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,820
Now it's my turn. Let me show
you a sample of my techniques.

112
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:48,000
There's another great power here.

113
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:59,140
That way... Range: 12,909.

114
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,210
It's large... the largest
power on this planet...

115
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,880
This time for sure, it's Kakarrot!

116
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,970
T-This is ridiculous!

117
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,370
I-I was shaking so much, I couldn't move!

118
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,420
Have you lost sight of your pride as a Saiyan,

119
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,160
the mightiest warriors in the universe...

120
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,940

121
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,410
<i>Who are these Saiyans,</i>
<i>the mightiest warriors in the universe?</i>

122
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,010
<i>And who is Kakarrot?</i>

123
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,750
<i>It appears that the mysterious alien</i>
<i>and Goku are somehow connected.</i>

124
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,860
<i>Next time, Goku's past</i>
<i>will finally become clear!</i>

125
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,910
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

126
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,790
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

127
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,160
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

128
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:03,660
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

129
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,140
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

130

<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

135
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,830
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

136
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,900
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

137
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,570
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

138
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,740
<i>So sorry.</i>
