<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:24,855
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:30,125
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:36,865
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:43,445
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:52,315
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:55,815
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:04,825
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,295
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:14,405
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:17,805
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:26,755
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,325
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:37,195
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:39,135
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:58,855
<i>Using his finishing move, the Body Change,</i>
<i>Ginyu switched his body with Goku's.</i>

17
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:09,695
<i>Meanwhile, Gohan and Kuririn had finally</i>
<i>found the Dragon Balls that Freeza had hidden.</i>

18
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:17,335
Come forth, Shen Long, and grant me my wish!

19
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:39,295
<i>However, nothing appeared to happen.</i>

20
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:50,435
<i>And, as Ginyu once again</i>
<i>confronted Gohan and Kuririn...</i>

21
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:05,385
<i>...he released all of the ki in Goku's body,</i>
<i>to demonstrate how powerful he had become.</i>

22
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:16,995
<i>"That Ain't Me! Gohan, Don't</i>
<i>Lose Your Nerve, Hit Your Father!!"</i>

23
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:54,295
Jheese, how high is my battle power now?

24
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,775
Yes, sir...

25
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:08,315
What's wrong? Jheese, hurry up and tell me!

26
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:11,745
I-It's 23,000.

27
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:14,815
What's that? I can't hear you!

28
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,485
23,000!

29
00:04:23,965 --> 00:04:26,835
There, you hear that?!

30
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:34,905
Just 23,000! That's all!

31
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:38,175
Why?

32
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:41,375
W-Why, you ask?

33
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,915
23,000?

34
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:49,915
You say it's just 23,000?!

35
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:53,855
That's my body there.

36
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:57,495
You see, unless your mind and body are united,

37
00:04:57,535 --> 00:04:59,695
you can't put out any great power!

38
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:03,835
Kuririn, Gohan, you can beat this guy now!

39
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:12,705
I-Impossible!

40
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,045
T-This is impossible!

41
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:21,715
I-It's true! We just might
be able to beat him like this!

42
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:22,815
Let's go, Gohan!

43
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,265
R-Right!

44
00:05:28,765 --> 00:05:30,465
Now, Gohan!

45
00:05:39,775 --> 00:05:41,735
What's the matter, Gohan?!

46
00:05:41,775 --> 00:05:43,265
Father...

47
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,475
Gohan!

48
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:51,945
What's the matter, Gohan?

49
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:58,595
I-I'm sorry. For a moment,
he seemed like he really was Father.

50
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:04,695
I-I know what you mean. I feel the same way.

51
00:06:04,735 --> 00:06:07,865
But that isn't Goku. It's Ginyu!

52
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,425
Got it?

53
00:06:10,905 --> 00:06:13,705
<i>Gohan... Kuririn...</i>

54
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:15,705
Okay, it won't happen this time.

55
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:17,005
Here we go!

56
00:07:09,135 --> 00:07:11,095
Jheese!

57
00:07:11,135 --> 00:07:15,265
What are you doing? Why don't you fight?!

58
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:17,665
Y-Yes, sir!

59
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:19,105
Whoa!

60
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:22,075
You're going to face me!

61
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:29,115
<i>Vegeta!</i>

62
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:33,055
You mean that lousy Vegeta is still around?

63
00:07:52,675 --> 00:07:56,165
You expect such a wimpy attack to hurt me?

64
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:06,755
W-Why?! This body is supposed to
have a power greater than 180,000!

65
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:10,825
Didn't you hear what Goku said before?

66
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:15,025
You can't use that body very well.

67
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,235
Why don't you just give up now?

68
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:27,075
G-Give up? You expect me,
Ginyu<i>-sama</i> to give up?!

69
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,405
Don't be ridiculous!

70
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:39,085
<i>Kuririn... Gohan...</i>

71
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:42,685
For someone such as yourself to
even consider picking a fight with me...

72
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:44,715
...takes a lot of guts!

73
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:49,095
Babble as much as you want!

74
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,465
How did you manage to hide yourself?!

75
00:08:57,505 --> 00:09:01,035
There wasn't any reading on my Scouter!

76
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,905
You guys rely too much on your Scouters!

77
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:06,615
If you were to fight
against those guys from Earth,

78
00:09:06,655 --> 00:09:09,175
you'd figure it out for yourself!

79
00:09:13,655 --> 00:09:17,055
That is, assuming you don't die here first!

80
00:09:17,095 --> 00:09:20,095
Don't be ridiculous! The Ginyu
Special Corps is made up of only

81
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:23,625
the most super-elite warriors in the universe!

82
00:09:23,665 --> 00:09:25,765
There's no way a monkey bastard such as you

83
00:09:25,805 --> 00:09:29,175
could ever stand a chance against me!

84
00:09:37,685 --> 00:09:41,415
So you say, but you're actually afraid of

85
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,045
my renewed battle power, aren't you?

86
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,115
W-What?

87
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:50,985
Take a good, long look,
with your precious Scouter there.

88
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:54,595
Afraid, you say?

89
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:58,625
Me? Afraid of a battle
power such as yours, Vegeta?

90
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,645
I-Impossible...

91
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,645
Dammit!

92
00:10:10,685 --> 00:10:12,345
It's broken!

93
00:10:14,055 --> 00:10:16,175
Do you really think it was a malfunction?

94
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:18,015
W-Why, you!

95
00:10:18,055 --> 00:10:21,015
Every time I recover from
being near death, I grow stronger.

96
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,185
I've also overcome the
limits of ordinary Saiyans,

97
00:10:23,225 --> 00:10:25,825
and I'm still getting stronger!

98
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,195
Actually, I've just now realized something–

99
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:37,035
This growth in power is not just
due to some kind of gift that I have.

100
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:41,445
Which means, I must be getting
very close to becoming one myself!

101
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:45,775
A Super Saiyan!

102
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:51,015
W-What?

103
00:10:51,055 --> 00:10:53,525
S-Stop talking nonsense!

104
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:58,655
A Super Saiyan is the mightiest of all warriors,

105
00:10:58,695 --> 00:11:00,555
delighting in death and battle!

106
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:03,365
Kakarrot may not be
cold-hearted enough to become one,

107
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:04,565
but I'm different!

108
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:08,235
I-I-Impossible!

109
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:42,195
Attaway, attaway!
We're really hitting our stride!

110
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:46,205
L-Looks like we're going
to beat him, huh, Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

111
00:11:46,245 --> 00:11:49,605
I-Impossible! How can I,
Commander of the Ginyu Special Corps,

112
00:11:49,645 --> 00:11:53,245
be beaten by these guys?

113
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:05,625
G-Goku,

114
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:08,055
Sure enough, it was useless trying to stop you,

115
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:12,625
and now you've become tangled
up in things better left untouched.

116
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:20,075
Goku, soon you will realize the
hidden terror possessed by Freeza.

117
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,305
It's not too late, even now.

118
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:26,005
Depart from that planet as quickly as you can!

119
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:04,645
I-If Dende... can just
make it to where they are...

120
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:28,635
You Namekians really are very stubborn.

121
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:32,045
You have absolutely no chance of winning.

122
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:36,385
I do not want to use my energy needlessly.

123
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,615
Dende...

124
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:16,185
I wonder how much longer I will
be able to view Namek's scenery.

125
00:14:16,225 --> 00:14:23,225
I hope it is until Dende reaches the Earthlings.

126
00:14:36,645 --> 00:14:41,445
W-When Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> dies,
the Dragon Balls will also disappear.

127
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:46,455
Before that happens, I have to
hurry and meet up with those people.

128
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:35,295
Oh, no!

129
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:06,005
Gohan!

130
00:16:21,085 --> 00:16:22,345
This is strange.

131
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:25,815
It's like suddenly, it seems
like he's gotten much stronger.

132
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:28,015
Watch yourself, Gohan!

133
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,815
R-Right!

134
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,925
<i>Impressive.</i>

135
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:36,725
Looks like he's starting
to get used to my body.

136
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:39,225
This ain't good.

137
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:40,935
From here on out,

138
00:16:40,975 --> 00:16:46,505
I'm not going to be pushed
around by rubbish like you guys!

139
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:50,605
Here it comes! The Ginyu Special Corps'...

140
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:56,175
I haven't done this by myself very much,

141
00:16:56,215 --> 00:17:00,515
but there's got to be something
good for me to say here...

142
00:17:00,555 --> 00:17:04,755
Oh well, maybe I'll just skip it
this time and leap right into battle.

143
00:17:07,435 --> 00:17:11,765
I-I-I wasn't finished yet!

144
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:21,105
I won't be beaten by that flimsy blast!

145
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,985
This one will be even harder!

146
00:17:32,555 --> 00:17:35,155
Gohan! Get out of the way!

147
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:42,825
Goku!

148
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:45,895
F-Father...

149
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:47,465
Yow-ow-ow!

150
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:50,705
H-How did you manage that in your condition?!

151
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:58,475
I-It's just like you're doing.
I'm starting to get used to this body.

152
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:00,315
I'm going to fight, too!

153
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:05,445
Y-You may have become partially used to it,

154
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:09,155
but you still can't generate its full power.

155
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:14,925
We've got to eliminate him,
before he completely masters my body.

156
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:17,165
With the three of us, we can beat him!

157
00:18:17,205 --> 00:18:18,495
Kuririn! Gohan!

158
00:18:18,535 --> 00:18:20,495
Right, Father!

159
00:18:20,535 --> 00:18:22,335
Y-Yeah!

160
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:33,375
There's something strange about this, huh?

161
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:37,385
I-I feel the same way.

162
00:18:37,425 --> 00:18:43,385
I-It's a little odd to think that
I'm about to attack my own body like this.

163
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:06,285
Vegeta! There's no way we're going to
be beaten by a monkey bastard like you!

164
00:19:14,955 --> 00:19:16,585
Babble on all you like!

165
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:22,225
It does not change the fact that you
are no longer a match for Vegeta<i>-sama</i>!

166
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:30,435
Now then, how about
I show you my true power?

167
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:13,785
S-S-Spare me–

168
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:38,805
Vegeta! You didn't have to go that far!

169
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:46,275
You just keep on spouting that
soft-hearted nonsense of yours, Kakarrot!

170
00:20:46,315 --> 00:20:49,575
You'll never become a Super Saiyan!

171
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,415
I'm the only one who has that capacity!

172
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:55,825
What? You, a Super Saiyan?

173
00:20:57,465 --> 00:21:00,485
Haven't you taken care of Ginyu yet?

174
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:04,595
All right then, I'll dispose of him for you!

175
00:21:04,635 --> 00:21:06,335
Move it!

176
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,865
I-Incredible!

177
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:39,925
Now, to finish you off!

178
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:43,295
Why, you...

179
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:46,535
T-That's enough! Don't kill him, Vegeta!

180
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:51,205
Die!!

181
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:58,215
<i>You fool!</i>

182
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,415
I-It can't be!

183
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:07,925
<i>Change</i>!!

184
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:15,025
What?

185
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:22,905
<i>Once again, Ginyu's signature</i>
<i>technique, the Body Change, bursts forth.</i>

186
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:26,815
<i>What is Ginyu's target</i>?

187
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:48,735
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

188
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:54,575
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

189
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:56,945
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

190
00:23:00,415 --> 00:23:05,445
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

191
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:11,955
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

192
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:16,055
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

193
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,565
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

194
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:22,195
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

195
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:29,705
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

196
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:33,805
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

197
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,615
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

198
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:39,645
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

199
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:45,325
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

200
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:47,495
<i>So sorry.</i>

201
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:52,625
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

202
00:23:55,375 --> 00:24:00,635
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

203
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,155
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

204
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:17,355
<i>I did it! I'm finally back in my original body!</i>

205
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:21,195
<i>I have to say, you've really</i>
<i>beaten my body up good, Vegeta.</i>

206
00:24:21,235 --> 00:24:26,295
<i>Hmph! Never mind that, tell me</i>
<i>exactly what happened to Ginyu!</i>

207
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:28,365
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

208
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:31,865
<i>"Whoops!! Ginyu Has Turned Into a Frog."</i>

209
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:34,745
<i>When you think about</i>
<i>Ginyu-san's life from now on,</i>

210
00:24:34,785 --> 00:24:36,715
"Next time"
"Whoops!! Ginyu Has Turned Into a Frog"
<i>you have to feel bad for him, huh?</i>
