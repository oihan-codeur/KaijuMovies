<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,830
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,140
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,450
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:52,320
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,830
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:04,840
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,310
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,820
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:26,730
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,330
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,200
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,110
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,490
Kuririn!

17
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,980
Kakarrot, I'll be taking the child.
If you want him returned alive,

18
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,650
you'll listen to what
your brother tells you to do!

19
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,660
<i>So strong! Raditz is exceedingly strong!</i>

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,760
<i>Gohan's life is in the hands</i>
<i>of Raditz, Goku's older brother.</i>

21
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,030
<i>Can Goku solve this problem in</i>
<i>any way other than the unthinkable?</i>

22
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,440
<i>"All Right! This is the</i>
<i>Strongest Combo in the World!"</i>

23
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,580
You got that? Let me
say it again just to be sure.

24
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,460
You are to kill a hundred
of this planet's people

25
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,790
and pile up their bodies here by tomorrow.

26
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,500
If you do, we will let you join our group.

27
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,670
And of course,

28
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,340
if there are no bodies here,
it will mean the death of your son.

29
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,980
Father!

30
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,150
T-That's gutless of you!
How can you use a child like that?!

31
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,150
–Yeah!
–He's right!

32
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,250
For one thing, there's no
way Goku could kill anyone!

33
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,990
That's fine.

34
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,690
If you don't mind letting this one die,

35
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,760
then there's no need
to have those bodies ready.

36
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
However,

37
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,670
one way or another, every person
on this planet is destined to die soon.

38
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,740
Once we finish subjugating
our current planet,

39
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,240
we've decided that our
next target will be this one!

40
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,890
Y-You what?

41
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,150
The three of us Saiyans ought to be enough

42
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,890
to wipe out the folks
on this planet in only a month.

43
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,390
Kakarrot, if you're the one
who kills a hundred people for me,

44
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,730
it's all the same in the end, isn't it?

45
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,840
Father! Father!

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,080
You got that, Kakarrot?
Any way you try to struggle out of it,

47
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,950
the only thing for you to do
is to join your brother's pals.

48
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,980
Give me back my child!

49
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:45,560
I'll be expecting a good answer from you.

50
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,730
For your sake, as well.

51
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:53,840
You cannot consider going against me.

52
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,300
With your incomplete battle power,

53
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,780
you can't possibly stand up
to your older brother, after all!

54
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,980
Father!

55
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,010
See you later!
I look forward to tomorrow!

56
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,290
Gohan!

57
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,720
Father!

58
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,960
Gohan!

59
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:29,470
Damn it all! He made a mockery of me!

60
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,970
Are you okay, Son<i>-kun</i>?

61
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,980
W-We're sorry! There
was nothing we could do!

62
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,580
G-Goku?

63
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,310
Kinto-Un!

64
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,580
Wait! That's crazy! Don't be rash!

65
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,920
You can't! You'll be killed!

66
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,020
If you go now, do
you think you could win?!

67
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,930
Damn! What should I do?

68
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,060
Think.

69
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,080
Hold on, now...

70
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,680
What a shock, huh? Here you
discover that you have a relative,

71
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,550
and of all people,
it turns out to be that guy!

72
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,820
Your brother... does have
greater than normal strength, and all.

73
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,990
His tail...

74
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,560
If I...

75
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,160
If I squeeze his tail hard enough,
his strength should drop off.

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,000
That's how it was for me.

77
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,170
N-Now that you mention it, that's true!

78
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:43,140
B-But still, are you going
to be able to grab his tail?

79
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,740
It'll be impossible for me to do it alone.

80
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,490
We will do as much as we can!

81
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:59,560
Yamucha and Tenshinhan aren't here, after all.

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,730
T-That's right...
And if the three of us fight together,

83
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,160
it just might work...

84
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,070
Though I'm not very confident about that...

85
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,170
Bulma<i>-san</i>, if we die, please bring us
back to life with the Dragon Balls, okay?

86
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,570
Leave it to me!

87
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,110
Kuririn, that won't work.

88
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:26,960
Kami<i>-sama</i> said that you can't ask Shen
Long to grant the same wish a second time.

89
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,620
Kuririn, both you
and Old Timer Turtle Hermit

90
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,160
have already had Shen Long
bring you back to life once.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,400
And so... we can't do it another time...

92
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,170
Oh... really?
E-Even so, n-no problem!

93
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,570
You'd help me out?

94
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,070
O-Of course we will!

95
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,610
You bet we will! This time,
it's our turn to lend you a hand, Goku!

96
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:04,190
<i>T-This time for sure, I'm dead.</i>
<i>Damn... And I wanted to get married too...</i>

97
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,460
Speaking of the Dragon
Balls, what if we did this?

98
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,770
Get all seven together, and
ask Shen Long to save the world!

99
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,140
Oh, yeah!

100
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,570
Do you think we could get
them all together in a single day?

101
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,100
Oh, yeah...

102
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,880
All right! We launch a
surprise attack of our own!

103
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:30,010
He wouldn't possibly think
that we would attack him,

104
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,980
so his guard should be down.

105
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,790
B-But we don't know where he is, right?

106
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,160
Bulma, do you have your
Dragon Radar with you?

107
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,660
That's right!

108
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,660
The ornament at the top of
Gohan<i>-kun</i>'s hat was a Dragon Ball, huh?

109
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,600
That's it, that's it!

110
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,900
Look! It's moving at tremendous speed!

111
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,840
It stopped!

112
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,010
Thank goodness! He's not
out in space, he's on Earth!

113
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,820
All right, let's go! It's all
or nothing! Just hang on, Gohan!

114
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,560
R-Right! Maybe we can win this!
The possibility is slim, though...

115
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,830
If we're going to be killed either way,

116
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,840
we'll feel better if we've done all we can.

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,870
This is too much for you guys!

118
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,110
–Piccolo!
–Piccolo!
–Piccolo!

119
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,490
What are you doing here?

120
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,030
I followed him here.

121
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,500
You've already met him?

122
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,500
That's right.

123
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,950
If you go with those two,
you won't be able to defeat him.

124
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,280
I will go with you.

125
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,480
You must have realized that
his strength is extraordinary.

126
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,220
He's an opponent that
neither you nor I can stand up to.

127
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,890
However...

128
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:25,460
...if you and I team up, then
there is a slight possibility that we...

129
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,340
...can defeat him.

130
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,470
Just what the hell has come over you?

131
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,910
Don't get me wrong.

132
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,750
It's not as though I have
become awakened to peace.

133
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,010
I don't care what
happens to your son, either.

134
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,520
It's just that he stands in the way of
the world domination that I am after!

135
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,960
We'll team up, but once we've
taken care of him and his two pals,

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,570
I'm going to defeat you, and this time,

137
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,900
I intend to take over the world for sure!

138
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,070
I won't let you do that!

139
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,450
I won't let you do that, but up through that
part where we team up, that's a good idea.

140
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,080
Looks like there ain't any other way, huh?

141
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,320
That's right! We'll
just have to put up with it.

142
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,030
As far as I'm concerned, teaming
up with you makes me want to puke!

143
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:36,470
Bulma, let me borrow your Dragon Radar.

144
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,170
Right.

145
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:44,040
Can you keep up with the speed of Kinto-Un?

146
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,810
Don't be absurd! My own
technique's a little different

147
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,650
from that pathetic
<i>Bukujutsu</i> skill of yours.

148
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,450
I'm not sure whether
I should be elated or not...

149
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,260
You know, I would have never
thought that those two would team up!

150
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,530
There's certainly no
stronger combo than them!

151
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,760
It's just possible that they might win!

152
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:43,670
B-But I wonder, is it safe
for us to trust Piccolo?

153
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,340
It's worrisome, isn't it?

154
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,010
What are you talking about?! This
is going to be an incredible spectacle!

155
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:53,710
Bulma! Do you remember the location
that reading was coming from on the Radar?

156
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,310
We're going too!

157
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,490
I wonder if Gohan<i>-chan</i> is havin'
fun at Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>'s place.

158
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:13,300
Oh, my! He still hasn't finished doin'
his developmental homework, has he?

159
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,170
I hope he'll be all right.

160
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,490
Father, I'm scared!

161
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,550
Will you shut up?! How long
are you going to keep blubbering?!

162
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,460
You carry the valiant
blood of the Saiyans too!

163
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,470
Get in there!

164
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,650
Let me out! Let me out!

165
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,150
Let me out, I say!

166
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,060
Now then,

167
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,000
how about I go find something to eat?

168
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,490
That's strange. A warning signal...

169
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,600
A battle power of 710? It's close!

170
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,770
What?

171
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,660
Damn. A malfunction, huh?

172
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,960
Don't scare me like that.

173
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,070
We're close!

174
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,670
I think we'd better descend pretty soon.

175
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:38,080
That won't work!
We're better off going in like this.

176
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,680
He's using a strange device.

177
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,580
It appears to be able
to clearly tell the position

178
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:46,080
and even the strength of a target.

179
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,420
You mean the fact that
we're closing in on him, too?

180
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,550
It stands to reason that he knows.

181
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,560
Really? Well, that means that the only
thing we can do is attack him head-on!

182
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,980
Again!

183
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,610
Battle power 710.

184
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,460
Sure enough, it's malfunctioning.

185
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,660
<i>There are two readings!</i>

186
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,360
<i>They're heading this way!</i>

187
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:36,070
One... two...
Battle powers 322 and 334...

188
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,100
One of them is the same as Kakarrot's ability.

189
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,580
But there's no way he would be coming here.

190
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,410
He has to know that there's close
to zero probability of him winning...

191
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,680
And he doesn't know
where I am in the first place.

192
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,030
I've had it. It's completely malfunctioning.

193
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,490
It couldn't be!

194
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,360
He's here!

195
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,070
<i>Then it's not a malfunction?!</i>

196
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,670
<i>No! There's definitely</i>
<i>some kind of mistake here!</i>

197
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:18,550
<i>It's not possible for a kid that</i>
<i>small to have a battle power of 710!</i>

198
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,520
So that's it. You're the other one, huh?

199
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,490
How did you know about this place?

200
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,060
You expect us to tell you?!

201
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,430
Very well. I'll ask you a
different question, then.

202
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,060
What the hell have you come here for?

203
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,500
It's obvious, ain't it?!
We've come to take my boy back!

204
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,200
It's Father!

205
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,070
Which means...

206
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,580
...even though you may be a Saiyan, like us,

207
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,610
you don't want to join our group?

208
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,950
That's what I said!

209
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,560
Oww!

210
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,060
Then you intend to defy your brother?

211
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,830
I ain't got any brothers!

212
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,600
Kakarrot...

213
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,240
I thought you'd be more sharp-witted.

214
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,350
To think that you'd be as
foolish as this... You disappoint me.

215
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,650
Don't tell me you've made
the ridiculous determination

216
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,680
that if the two of you
attack me, you can win!

217
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:14,290
That's enough of your tiresome drivel.

218
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,460
Piccolo,

219
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,070
have you been training
by wearing heavy stuff too?

220
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,540
Yeah, just like you.

221
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,680
It's been a long time
since I felt this light.

222
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,080
<i>His battle power has gone up to 408!</i>

223
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,280
I see. You've been desperately
training yourself too, huh?

224
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,330
Being able to fight together as allies
for the time being like this is encouraging.

225
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:51,000
Maybe now we can have
ourselves a little bit better of a fight.

226
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,060
<i>Kakarrot is now at 416...</i>

227
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,610
You guys think you've gotten
all stronger by doing that?

228
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,370
What?!

229
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,140
Don't make me laugh!

230
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,380
To think that you would stroll
on in here with that kind of power!

231
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,550
This is what they mean when
they say you don't know your place.

232
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:15,990
Just being stronger in
a fight ain't everything!

233
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,000
We've got ourselves a strategy!

234
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:24,230
I've had enough of your smart-mouth.

235
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,870
Kakarrot, I've decided not to
let you join our group any longer.

236
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,900
It appears you'd just slow us down, anyhow.

237
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,840
You're a disgrace to our family! Die!

238
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,400
<i>H-He's fast! What speed!</i>

239
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:16,440
<i>And he came at us head-on! For him</i>
<i>to get behind us in that one moment!</i>

240
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:22,020
Your defense, at least,
appears to be pretty strong.

241
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,860
However, your deaths are
only a matter of time now.

242
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:31,630
Little by little, I'm going to
increase the strength of my attacks!

243
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,670
<i>T-To think that the difference</i>
<i>in our levels would be this great!</i>

244
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,240
<i>Somehow, I have to grab his tail,</i>
<i>and make his power drop!</i>

245
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,280
It's hopeless! No matter what
strategy you may have come up with,

246
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,180
there's no way you can beat me!

247
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,290
I know... Why don't I let you in
on something good before you die?

248
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,490
The two other Saiyans
besides me who are still alive

249
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,500
have an even higher
battle power than I do!

250
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,270
<i>What unprecedented terror!</i>
<i>Even if Raditz is defeated,</i>

251
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,980
<i>there are still even</i>
<i>more powerful warriors?</i>

252
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,950
<i>There is nothing that</i>
<i>Goku and Piccolo can do!</i>

253
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,700
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

254
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,580
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

255
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,950
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

256
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:03,450
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

257
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,930
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

258
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:14,030
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

259
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,530
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

260
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,200
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

261
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:27,720
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

262
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,780
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

263
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,620
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

264
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,690
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

265
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:43,360
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

266
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,530
<i>So sorry.</i>

267
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:50,630
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

268
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,610
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

269
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,590
Heya! I'm Goku!

270
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,760
<i>Damn, we're in way over our heads!</i>

271
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,830
<i>What's the matter? Are you finished already?</i>

272
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,730
<i>Where did all that gusto you had earlier go?!</i>

273
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,600
<i>Piccolo, I'll draw his</i>
<i>attention. The rest is up to you!</i>

274
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,600
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

275
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,410
<i>"Piccolo's Trump Card!</i>
<i>Gohan, the Crybaby-kun."</i>

276
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,780
<i>Stop picking on my father!</i>

277
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,280
"Next time"
"Piccolo's Trump Card!
Gohan, the Crybaby<i>-kun"</i>
