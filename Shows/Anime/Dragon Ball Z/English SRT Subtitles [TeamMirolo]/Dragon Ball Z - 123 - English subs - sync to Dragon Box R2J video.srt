<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,970
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,290
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,660
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:04,670
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,650
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:26,600
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,170
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,790
<i>Trunks, the youth who traveled back 20</i>
<i>years from the future in a time machine,</i>

17
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,790
<i>delivers some frightening news.</i>

18
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,930
In three years from this time,

19
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,430
on an island about nine
kilometers from Metro South,

20
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,140
a terrifying pair of villains will appear.

21
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,810
Who are they? Are they aliens?

22
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,810
They are monsters, both
possessing a power so great,

23
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,340
it's unthinkable that they are of this world.

24
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,360
Dad, please don't die.

25
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,670
Young mom, you hang in there too.

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,170
<i>And so, Trunks returned home.</i>

27
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,840
<i>Son Goku and the others</i>
<i>have resolved to defy history,</i>

28
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,010
<i>and prepare themselves for battle.</i>

29
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:01,550
<i>"Goku's New Finishing Technique!?</i>
<i>Watch My Instantaneous Movement."</i>

30
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,180
Kakarrot, tell us!

31
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,180
How did you survive Planet Namek?!

32
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,950
Hey, that's right!

33
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,290
Freeza's spaceship was all busted up, wasn't it?

34
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:34,490
Even Kaio<i>-sama</i> said there
was no way you could survive.

35
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,670
I thought it was hopeless myself...

36
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,680
Move it! Move it!

37
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,990
It's exploding! Namek is exploding!

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
Dammit... dammit!

39
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,170
I thought I was really
gonna buy the dust there.

40
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:29,180
But lucky for me, there were
those ball-like spaceships nearby.

41
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,180
So that's it! The ships that
the Ginyu Special Corps came in!

42
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,620
Anyhow, I got into one of them,

43
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,990
and started flipping every switch I could find.

44
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,540
Crap! Crap! Crap!

45
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,440
Gohan!

46
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,690
Looks like I came down pretty hard.

47
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,990
I guess this isn't Heaven, is it?

48
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,410
The Ginyu Corps were set to invade Yardrat.

49
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,210
The ships were input with
instructions to land there.

50
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,450
That explains it.

51
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,320
That outfit must be
from the people of Yardrat.

52
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,320
Yeah. I made friends with
them, and they gave it to me.

53
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,390
These clothes looks a little
funny, but mine were all torn up.

54
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,820
I know you well enough!

55
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,660
You wouldn't go to Yardrat
and come back empty-handed.

56
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,460
Those guys may not have much power,

57
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,760
but they do employ some odd techniques!

58
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,170
You learned them, didn't you?!

59
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,300
Bingo!

60
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,300
So that's it!

61
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,310
No wonder you didn't
return to Earth for so long.

62
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,680
So, tell us, what kind of
techniques did you learn?

63
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,680
I didn't have much time,
so I only learned one technique.

64
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,680
Even so, I had to work
really hard to get it down.

65
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,590
I can now perform "Instantaneous Movement."

66
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,090
Instantaneous Movement?!

67
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,160
Really, Son? Show us!

68
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,160
You want to see? Okay.

69
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,670
To do this, you have to bring to
mind a person, rather than a place.

70
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,170
More precisely, you have
to feel out that person's <i>ki.</i>

71
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,670
That means you can't go someplace
where there aren't any people.

72
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,180
So then, where should I go...?

73
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,340
Got it!

74
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,350
Bye-bye!

75
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,020
He disappeared!

76
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,160
So where's the "Instantaneous Movement"?

77
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,690
You're just trying to fool us
by moving at super speeds.

78
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,700
Ta-da! What are these here?

79
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,670
Aren't those Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>'s sunglasses?!

80
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,000
He's right!

81
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,170
They're gone, gone!

82
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,200
My sunglasses are gone!

83
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,680
But we're over 10,000 kilometers
from the Kame House! Incredible!

84
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,210
Must be the real thing then, huh?

85
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,690
Kuririn, give these back to
the old man when you see him.

86
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,030
You got it.

87
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:37,830
You can do anything now, can't you?

88
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,200
That's not true.

89
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,330
All right. Well everyone,

90
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,700
let's meet up again in three years
where this is supposed to happen.

91
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:47,700
When and where should we go in three years?

92
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,940
Oh, that's right, he mentioned that.

93
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,310
I've already forgotten.

94
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,110
Three years from now,
on May 12, around 10 a.m.,

95
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,180
on an island nine kilometers
southwest of Metro South.

96
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,690
We can get together at that
island at 9 a.m., an hour earlier.

97
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,190
Thank goodness!

98
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,030
Boy, it's a good thing Piccolo overheard you!

99
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,700
Let me say now, that if any of you
are unsure of yourselves, stay away.

100
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,130
Our opponents this time are
even more terrible than any before.

101
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,470
We won't be any match for them...

102
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,970
...if we have one of our own slowing us down.

103
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,640
That's right. Stay away!

104
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,140
Don't make me laugh.

105
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,150
Aren't you the least sure
of yourself of anyone here?

106
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,150
What was that? Should we find out?!

107
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,320
Easy, easy.

108
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,290
Hey, know what? I was just thinking.

109
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:49,130
What if we get rid of this Doctor Gero,

110
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,660
the one who creates the
Artificial Humans, right now?

111
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,410
Even if we don't know where he is,

112
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,680
we could use the Dragon
Balls and ask Shen Long.

113
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,150
He'll be sure to tell us where he is.

114
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:05,310
If we do that,

115
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,650
then we won't have to bother going
through all that agony in three years.

116
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,150
Hey, yeah! That's right, Bulma<i>-san.</i>

117
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,460
If we do so, we sure won't have to fight later!

118
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,120
Great! Way to go, Bulma<i>-san</i>!

119
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,190
If you pull an uncalled-for stunt like that,

120
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,200
I'll kill you! You got that?!

121
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,600
What do you mean uncalled-for?
This isn't a game you know!

122
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,970
The fate of the Earth is in the balance!

123
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,640
Bulma<i>-san</i>! Bulma<i>-san</i>!

124
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,170
Son<i>-kun</i>, you agree with me, don't you?

125
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,650
Sorry. To be honest, I want to fight them.

126
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,150
Besides that, this scientist
hasn't even built anything yet,

127
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,030
how can we take him out?

128
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,960
The rest of you!

129
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,030
We don't have to go along with these Saiyans!

130
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,630
They're just a race of fighting maniacs!

131
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,170
If you die this time, there's
no bringing you back to life!

132
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,340
I'm going to fight too.
I want to see what I'm capable of.

133
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,180
If I die, then I'll concede
that that's all I could do.

134
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,690
Well, I never!

135
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,190
Bulma<i>-san</i>, this is the way I see it.

136
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,690
Everyone here used to be enemies in the past.

137
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:28,700
For my part, I hated Goku at first.

138
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,370
But when a terrible opponent appears,

139
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,200
there's no choice but
for everyone to join forces.

140
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,700
As a result, without us realizing it,
we've also become friends.

141
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,680
Ordinarily, this type of
thing wouldn't happen.

142
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,680
Not with everyone as
frighteningly powerful as they are.

143
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,660
What are you trying to say?

144
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,890
Without the target
provided by a common enemy,

145
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,860
even allowing that
Piccolo wouldn't make trouble,

146
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,230
we can pretty well guess that
Vegeta is going to lord it over us.

147
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:08,170
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, you had such a
good speech going there for a while.

148
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,710
You be quiet. I don't need any sass.

149
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,210
What I'm saying is the truth.

150
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,210
Fine, I understand you.

151
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,810
You can all do what you want.

152
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,480
Those city people caught in
the crossfire will pay the price,

153
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,650
being as fragile as I am.

154
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,990
Let's take back a peaceful future!

155
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,160
You're just like some kind of crazy dictator!

156
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,670
This time you're absolutely
mistaken! It's abnormal!

157
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,470
There's nothing I can do about it,

158
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,470
so I'll keep associating with you for now.

159
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,010
Well then, three years from now–

160
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,460
um, May 12, 10 a.m. at that island.

161
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,130
We won't mind if you don't feel you're up to it.

162
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,960
Kakarrot!

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,200
Just because you can become a Super Saiyan,

164
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,970
don't get too full of yourself!

165
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:16,470
I'm still going to beat the
crap out of you some time.

166
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:20,480
Don't you forget that I am
still the Number One Saiyan!

167
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,010
Right.

168
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,290
We're leaving too. See you in three years.

169
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,920
Bye-bye.

170
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,490
Chaozu, show up really strong now!

171
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,370
Tenshinhan<i>-san</i>, come up with
some incredible new techniques!

172
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,970
Piccolo...

173
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,470
Why don't you come train with me and Gohan?

174
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,470
I want to spar and stuff.

175
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,010
Sounds good, I was hoping to myself.

176
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,010
Kuririn and Yamucha, care to join us?

177
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,490
I'm fine. I'll be training at my
own pace with Muten Roshi<i>-sama.</i>

178
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,150
I'll decline too.

179
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:09,490
Quite honestly, I don't think
I could keep up with your training.

180
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,690
Okay then.

181
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,530
That's right! Bulma!

182
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,870
Have yourself a healthy baby!

183
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,450
Baby? Bulma<i>-san</i>, are you pregnant?

184
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:38,450
No, I'm not. What could
he be jibbering about?

185
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,460
See, in other words–

186
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,290
He's saying why don't we finally get married,

187
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,170
settle down and raise a happy family?

188
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,170
Now even he's starting to say so!

189
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:04,650
<i>And so, to prepare for the appearance</i>
<i>of their fearsome foes in three years,</i>

190
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,020
<i>everyone departed for their</i>
<i>respective training grounds.</i>

191
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,820
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>!

192
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,460
Kuririn, there was a ghost!

193
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,160
Earlier, Goku's ghost appeared
and made off with my glasses!

194
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,370
Huh? What are you doing with my glasses?

195
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,000
I wish to once again further my training...

196
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,970
Now I can look without being worried.

197
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:38,980
Um, I was thinking of restarting
my training, you see... Uh...

198
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,510
Muten Roshi<i>-sama</i>, my training!

199
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,960
Build you a 300G gravity room, you say?

200
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,460
That's right!

201
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,470
I heard Kakarrot trained
under the force of 100G.

202
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,000
So I'm going to undergo triple that!

203
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,470
That's unheard of!

204
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,310
Vegeta<i>-kun</i>, assuming you weigh 60 kilos now,

205
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,480
you'd end up weighing 18 tons!

206
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,350
I'm afraid it's out of the question.

207
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,860
Build it! Just build it for me!

208
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,020
I have had enough!!

209
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,000
You gotta be kiddin'!

210
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,300
Goku<i>-sa</i>, how long are you
gonna stand in Gohan<i>-chan</i>'s way

211
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,680
before you're satisfied?!

212
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,310
I wanted to get
Gohan<i>-chan</i> to study even more,

213
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,140
so I bought that Academic Dresser Center,

214
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,980
and the Somnioscholastic Bed!

215
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,650
And now you want to take him
trainin' with you to strengthen him up?!

216
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,350
You just butt out!

217
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,490
Goku<i>-sa</i>, you can just
train with Piccolo by yourself!

218
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,030
But I already told you, we're
going to need Gohan's power too.

219
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,600
I understand about
studying, but in three years,

220
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,630
Earth itself is going to be in great danger.

221
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,510
You talk so big! Goku<i>-sa,</i>

222
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,280
you never do any work, you
can't take care of Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

223
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,950
Have you ever earned even a penny,
in all the time we've been married?

224
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,450
When you say it that way,

225
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,950
I'm sorry, but this isn't the time for that.

226
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,660
Gohan's already made
up his mind to fight with us.

227
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,230
No way! No way! Nothin'
you say will change my mind!

228
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,800
Then, you think Gohan's studying...

229
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,470
...is more important than
the future of the world?

230
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,070
That's right! Of course it is!

231
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,240
It doesn't matter whatever else may happen!

232
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,470
Gohan<i>-chan</i>'s studyin' is
more important than anythin'!

233
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,680
You're such a kidder!

234
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,150
Sorry, Chichi!

235
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,360
I've gotten too strong,
and meant to just tap you!

236
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,960
I really am sorry.

237
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,460
I can't believe I let this happen.

238
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,970
It's all right! The woman
always backs down eventually.

239
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,470
But three years from now, I'm going
to be putting an end to his kung fu.

240
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,340
Three more years, that's it!

241
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,450
So, even Super Saiyans have weaknesses.

242
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,820
<i>And so, the harsh training begins all around...</i>

243
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,020
Ten<i>-san...</i>

244
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,550
Ten<i>-san</i>, nicely done.

245
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,010
Oh, this is great!

246
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,680
Hey, Kuririn! These are great!

247
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,360
Hey, Kuririn, why don't
you come check this out?

248
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,030
Let's go, Gohan!

249
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,030
Right!

250
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,000
Too soft!

251
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,900
Should we call it a day?

252
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,500
Yeah.

253
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,470
Pl-Please, let me try a little longer.

254
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,680
I want to become stronger.

255
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:23,520
Just like you two, Father and Piccolo<i>-san.</i>

256
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:44,480
You there, stop looking
elsewhere and start using the machine.

257
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,850
Oh, right.

258
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:56,690
I guess using these
machines won't serve as training.

259
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,170
I will surpass them!

260
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:14,880
I will surpass even the Super Saiyans!

261
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,480
<i>The harsh training continues.</i>

262
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,860
<i>Three years from now, who will</i>
<i>defy their destiny and remain alive?</i>

263
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,480
Come on!

264
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,540
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

265
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,380
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

266
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,760
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

267
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:05,260
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

268
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,770
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

269
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,870
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

270
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,370
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

271
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:22,010
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

272
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:29,490
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

273
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,620
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

274
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,420
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

275
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,460
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

276
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,130
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

277
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,300
<i>So sorry.</i>

278
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,440
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

279
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,450
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

280
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,960
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

281
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,870
<i>It's been a while since we parted</i>
<i>ways. Is everyone doing all right?</i>

282
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,270
<i>I hope you haven't gotten too</i>
<i>fired up, and hurt yourselves.</i>

283
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:23,670
<i>Hey, Vegeta! Enough of your recklessness!</i>

284
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,170
<i>What are we going to</i>
<i>do if you wreck the house?</i>

285
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,280
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

286
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,780
<i>"I Will Overcome Goku!!</i>
<i>The King of the Saiyan Warrior Race."</i>

287
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,020
<i>I want to get stronger, too!</i>

288
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,150
"Next time"
"I Will Overcome Goku!!
The King of the Saiyan Warrior Race"
