1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,520
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,830
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,100
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,420
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:52,290
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,790
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,270
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,780
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:26,730
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,300
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:37,170
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,110
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,790
I do you a great service!

17
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:59,460
You will experience a terror
even greater than that of Hell's.

18
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,830
And so, gaze upon my true form!

19
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,980
Freeza, or anyone else, bring it on!

20
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,080
I have now become a Super Saiyan!

21
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,280
<i>At last, Freeza shows his third transformation.</i>

22
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,320
<i>What is this unprecedented, ultimate power?</i>

23
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:13,200
<i>"The Death of Dende...</i>
<i>Come Forth! Intense, Wide-Open Power."</i>

24
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,100
That's Freeza's true self?

25
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:56,940
He's smaller, more simple-looking,
and less formidable...

26
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,480
He's become an excellent example of why...

27
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,980
...you don't judge another's
ability by outward appearances!

28
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,990
Everything he's looked like up
until now has been cute by comparison!

29
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,660
D-Damn it to hell!

30
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,330
After all the trouble you went through
to revive me with the Dragon Balls!

31
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,530
I'm sorry...

32
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,970
There's simply no way I can
save the rest of you now. Damn...

33
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,670
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

34
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,490
Freeza, you've finally
shown your true form, have you?

35
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,630
Even supposing Son Goku recovers,

36
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:54,160
Freeza now has the power to
destroy the universe as we know it.

37
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,340
This could be the point of no return!

38
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,820
<i>How can this be?</i>

39
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,650
<i>Freeza's ki has risen once again!</i>

40
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,860
<i>Dammit...</i>

41
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,680
"Bang."

42
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,770
What?

43
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,150
Dende!!

44
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,780
<i>I didn't see it coming!</i>

45
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,160
<i>A-All I saw was some kind of flash!</i>

46
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,890
<i>T-That's not possible!</i>

47
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:33,570
Now, there will be no more revivals.

48
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,170
Dende...

49
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,280
<i>Someone just died. Who was it? Damn!</i>

50
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,320
<i>I can't tell what's going on any more!</i>

51
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,670
Dende's been... k-killed...

52
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,670
H-He...

53
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,020
He saw that we were being
revived by that Namekian...

54
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,980
That's why he was first...

55
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,180
<i>Damn you...</i>

56
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,160
H-He vanished!

57
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,670
<i>Y-You fool!</i>

58
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,640
J-Just where...

59
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,510
Over here!

60
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,020
How did he?

61
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,690
I made you a promise, didn't I?

62
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,530
To show you a terror even greater than Hell's.

63
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:18,640
However, for that Namekian child
there to not be able to experience this...

64
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,010
it seems a shame, doesn't it?

65
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,680
I'll just have to let you guys take his share.

66
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,030
You bastard!

67
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,990
Take this!

68
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,500
You're not getting away!

69
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,510
Did you get him?

70
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,290
H-He's vanished again.

71
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,630
T-That's impossible!

72
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,630
You ignorant fools!

73
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,970
He's behind you!

74
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,170
What?!

75
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,330
As he said...

76
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,940
Get out of the way!

77
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,640
Worthless idiot!

78
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,550
O-Once again...

79
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:34,590
I couldn't see... him move... or attack...

80
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,800
<i>But he... Vegeta saw it!</i>

81
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,840
<i>Why? Have his abilities gone up that much?!</i>

82
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,310
Thanks!

83
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,180
You saved me.

84
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,710
You've got it all wrong.
I didn't do it to save you.

85
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,320
I thought I'd show you guys something good.

86
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,990
S-Something good?

87
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,340
Don't tell me you... you think you can beat him?

88
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,110
You might say that.

89
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,490
You can't possibly...

90
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,380
You guys are in our way.

91
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Pull back and watch very closely!

92
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,130
Such confidence, Vegeta.

93
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,400
Or perhaps you're so frightened,
something has snapped?

94
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,370
You just keep on smirking
like that, while you still can.

95
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,210
What stands before you...

96
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:59,480
is that...

97
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,350
which you fear most!

98
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:05,690
A Super Saiyan!

99
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,190
Super... Saiy... an?

100
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,860
<i>What's this "Super Saiyan"</i>
<i>business he's talking about?</i>

101
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,310
As always, your jokes go too far.

102
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:35,280
In that case, I'll show
you the abilities I possess,

103
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,490
now that I have become a Super Saiyan!

104
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:06,770
<i>Is this ki Vegeta's?</i>
<i>He's had an incredible power-up!</i>

105
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,000
A-Awesome!

106
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,310
<i>What's this?</i>

107
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,010
<i>Why is he so powered-up?</i>

108
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,490
<i>It's like he's a different person!</i>

109
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:53,860
<i>What the hell happened to him?</i>

110
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,470
W-When a Saiyan recovers from near-death,

111
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,010
their power goes up several times over!

112
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,020
What?!

113
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,000
Gohan, let's put our money on
Vegeta, and take shelter for now.

114
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,030
Right!

115
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,800
You know, to think that suddenly,

116
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,970
someone could have
achieved this much of a power-up...

117
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,810
You can see it for yourself.

118
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,980
This is exactly why Vegeta
purposely came close to dying,

119
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,980
then got himself revived by Dende.

120
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,820
<i>S-So that's what he was doing, huh?</i>

121
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,190
<i>He was right...</i>

122
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,950
And now, Vegeta really is incredible!

123
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:25,480
With any luck, he might
actually take Freeza! Right, Gohan?!

124
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,180
W-What? What happened?

125
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,320
They're both the same
as they were before. What...

126
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,290
No, they aren't, Gohan. Try sensing Vegeta's <i>ki.</i>

127
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,500
It's calm now, but unbelievably huge!

128
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,350
Incredible! I can't believe his <i>ki</i> is so full!

129
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:07,190
Yeah. Vegeta really might be
able to beat Freeza at this point.

130
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,370
I'm supposed to think that
somehow you've powered up quite a bit.

131
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,670
You dare say! Just be grateful
you don't have a Scouter with you!

132
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,470
If your Scouter were to
read my battle rating now,

133
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,680
you would run away from here in tears!

134
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:40,020
The reason being, my power has
now become even greater than yours!

135
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,320
Brace yourself, Freeza.

136
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,020
This time, for sure, you
are going to meet your end!

137
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,830
What's the matter?

138
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,330
Are you too frightened to say anything?

139
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,530
Well, Freeza<i>-san</i>?

140
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,370
Okay, okay. I get you, I get you.

141
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,170
If you mean everything you said,
then I've decided to see for myself

142
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,710
the power of this so-called,
legendary Super Saiyan,

143
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,720
the strongest warrior in history.

144
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,150
Don't you mock me!

145
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,660
I see you!

146
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,450
Kakarrot won't even get a turn!

147
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,750
I-Incredible!

148
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,720
He's completely got Freeza on the run!

149
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,290
No!

150
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,960
V-Vegeta's... h-had it!

151
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,660
P-Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

152
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,310
What's the matter, Freeza?!

153
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,180
You can't defeat me by running away!

154
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,590
What? I-It can't be! Where is he?

155
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:26,570
There's no way I... a Super Saiyan
like me could have lost sight of him!

156
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,520
What?!

157
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:38,240
Im... possible...

158
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,310
I raise my speed in earnest for just a moment,

159
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,680
and you can't keep up, can you?

160
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,090
And you call yourself a Super Saiyan?

161
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:53,990
I-It can't be...

162
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,990
How can he toy with Vegeta,
with all his power and speed?

163
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,030
He really is an unthinkable beast after all!

164
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,540
F-Father!

165
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:15,410
<i>A little longer... a little bit longer,</i>
<i>and I will have recovered!</i>

166
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,680
<i>Overwhelming speed and power–</i>

167
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,350
<i>and yet, it's still not enough to</i>
<i>match Freeza's ultimate power?</i>

168
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,880
<i>What will be the fate of Vegeta,</i>
<i>now that he has been shown his limits?</i>

169
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:48,810
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

170
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:54,650
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

171
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,020
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

172
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:05,520
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

173
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,030
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

174
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,130
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

175
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:19,640
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

176
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,310
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

177
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:29,780
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

178
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,880
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

179
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,720
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

180
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,720
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

181
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,400
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

182
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,570
<i>So sorry.</i>

183
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:52,700
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

184
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,710
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

185
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,020
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

186
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,300
<i>I've gotten stronger! It's like</i>
<i>the power is welling up inside!</i>

187
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,000
<i>I'm coming now, everyone!</i>

188
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,930
<i>No matter which of you lower-life-form,</i>

189
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,270
<i>nothing-in-your-mind-but-fighting</i>
<i>Saiyans show up, it's all the same.</i>

190
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,970
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

191
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,340
<i>"How I've Waited for this Moment!!!</i>
<i>Son Goku Revived."</i>

192
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,210
<i>Father has finally arrived on the battlefield!</i>

193
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,320
"Next time"
"How I've Waited for this Moment!!!
Son Goku Revived"

194
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:34,890
<i>Father has finally arrived on the battlefield!</i>
