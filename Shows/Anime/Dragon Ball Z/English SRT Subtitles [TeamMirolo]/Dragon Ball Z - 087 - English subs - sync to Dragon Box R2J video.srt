For you to beg of me, must
have been awfully difficult, I bet.

20
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:02,105
I understand.

21
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:07,145
It wasn't that your fellow Saiyans
had been killed that was rough on you...

22
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:16,255
I hated you so much...

23
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:22,095
...but you had your Saiyan pride.

24
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:26,405
And now I too will share in
some of that pride of yours.

25
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:33,205

28
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:14,775
...as well as for the Namekians here...

29
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,605
I am going to beat you!

30
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,315
Such drivel.

31
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:49,315
It utterly sickens me how you worms can
share this consciousness among yourselves.

32
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,795
A worm is a worm.

33
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:56,325
Your legend will not be fulfilled.

34
00:04:56,365 --> 00:05:02,095
I don't have anything to do
with this Super Saiyan stuff. Still...

35
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,125
I am going to defeat you!

36
00:05:11,975 --> 00:05:15,775
How is the situation on Namek?

37
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,145
Vegeta has died.

38
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,015
W-What's that?!

39
00:05:20,055 --> 00:05:22,915
Vegeta, did you say?

40
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:27,425
That's right. He was killed
by Freeza, and easily so.

41
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:32,325
Even though he served as Freeza's
hands and feet, working exactly as ordered,

42
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:37,705
in the end he was betrayed
and killed by him. What a shame!

43
00:05:39,475 --> 00:05:43,335
It was his pride as a Saiyan, I suppose.

44
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,675
So that's how terrifying
a guy this Freeza is, then?

45
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:50,115
They touched that
which must not be touched.

46
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:52,375
That which must not be touched!

47
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:56,355
Damn it all! Not even Goku
is a match for a rat like that!

48
00:05:56,395 --> 00:05:58,555
So, what about Goku?

49
00:05:58,595 --> 00:06:00,025
He intends to fight.

50
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:03,295
It seems that, no matter what,
he's determined to defeat Freeza.

51
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:04,925
Goku!

52
00:06:06,605 --> 00:06:09,025
G-Goku...

53
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,565
Goku!

54
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:51,435
<i>He's got such power under wraps.</i>

55
00:06:51,475 --> 00:06:54,605
Goku, when did you find all that power?

56
00:06:58,055 --> 00:07:01,945
<i>I implore you, Son Goku, defeat him,</i>

57
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:05,785
<i>and give me another chance to challenge you!</i>

58
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:14,795
You guys, get away from this
place! We're in the way here!

59
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:19,805
Gohan! Hurry up!

60
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,805
Gohan!

61
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:27,115
Father!

62
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:32,445
Father, don't die! Let Freeza have it!

63
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:08,745
So fast!

64
00:08:08,785 --> 00:08:10,455
Father...

65
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:14,115
I get it. He can't sense <i>ki</i>!

66
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:28,265
Father!

67
00:09:28,305 --> 00:09:30,135
Gohan!

68
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,445
It's incredible! It's too incredible!

69
00:10:41,205 --> 00:10:43,505
<i>That got him for sure.</i>

70
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,775
T-This is a Saiyan?

71
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:22,775
So many of these insects have
overestimated their own power,

72
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,275
and defied me up until now.

73
00:11:26,315 --> 00:11:30,655
I've never seen a Saiyan
able to take things this far!

74
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:15,565
Over there!

75
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:16,455
H-Has something happened?

76
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,985
D-Don't tell us Son has...?

77
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,865
He's putting up a good fight.

78
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:29,205
These Saiyan characters are strange ones.

79
00:13:29,245 --> 00:13:34,305
Or perhaps this is limited to Goku,
but there's no upper limit to his strength.

80
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:38,475
It's like he's a different
person from when he trained here.

81
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:42,545
He really is impossible
to understand, indeed.

82
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:44,455
Such an unusual guy...

83
00:13:44,495 --> 00:13:46,155
Such an unusual guy!

84
00:14:05,515 --> 00:14:08,475
Ah, that was good!

85
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:12,855
But it's no use. I can't walk any more!

86
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,655
I'm going to die here.

87
00:14:18,695 --> 00:14:21,485
Without ever getting back to Earth...

88
00:14:21,525 --> 00:14:25,155
...without anyone to
watch over me... quietly...

89
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:29,535
It's true what they say,
beautiful women do die young.

90
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:00,125
That's enough!

91
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:04,665
Who would ever expect me to
die here among all these frogs?!

92
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:01,155
Oooh, yow.

93
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:06,125
Now, then...

94
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,495
<i>He's not that bad...</i>

95
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:13,495
You're an impudent one!

96
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:33,485
What's this?

97
00:17:12,195 --> 00:17:15,865
I-It's an eruption! What's it doing there?

98
00:17:21,145 --> 00:17:23,105
Father!

99
00:17:23,145 --> 00:17:24,935
Gohan!

100
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:28,775
If you go, you'll just
get in the way. Have faith!

101
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,975
Goku isn't as green as all that!

102
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:42,785
Father...

103
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,165
Son...

104
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:33,165
That's far enough.

105
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:49,125
I wonder if he's burned up.

106
00:18:49,165 --> 00:18:52,125
What a disappointing
way to end the scene.

107
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,825
Goku!

108
00:18:59,835 --> 00:19:02,135
Oh dear, you didn't have to come all this way.

109
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,665
I would have come to you.

110
00:19:11,855 --> 00:19:15,185
I'll kill you quickly.

111
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,815
That was close, that was close!

112
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:48,185
If I'd fallen in there, I would've died!

113
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,805
Here goes.

114
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,785
Son!

115
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:49,835
Son! Behind you!

116
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:57,845
I'm not going to keep falling
into the same trap like that!

117
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:03,485
Don't go messing up other
people's planets so much!

118
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:05,855
What will you do once you break it?!

<i>Frightening powers tear</i>
