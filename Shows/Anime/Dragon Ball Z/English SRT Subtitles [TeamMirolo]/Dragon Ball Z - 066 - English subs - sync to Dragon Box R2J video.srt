<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:59,780
<i>All seven Dragon Balls had finally</i>

17

N-Nothing is happening, huh?

18
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,480
There has to be some sort of passcode for these!

19
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,290
<i>Meanwhile, Gohan was</i>
<i>about to lose his young life</i>

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,860
I won't be beaten by you!

22

<i>However, just then...</i>

23
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,700
What's that?

24
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,440
It's a ship. A ship has landed.

25
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:18,620
<i>"Uncommon Strength!!</i>
<i>Son Goku, the Legendary Super Saiyan."</i>

26
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,770
No doubt about it. Goku
has landed on Planet Namek.

27
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,070
Son...

28
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,530
Touchdown. Touchdown on Planet Namek.

29
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,630
Disembarkation okay. Disembarkation okay.
Opening door. Opening door.

30
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,640
What's this? Whose spaceship is that?

31
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,010
It's Goku! Goku has finally arrived!

32
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,260
I have to find those three quickly.

33
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:48,140
Be alive, Kuririn, Gohan, and Bulma.

34
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,950
There's one over this way...

35
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,890
...and one over that way...

36
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,800
What is this?

37
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,200
This place is packed with guys
that have ridiculously enormous <i>ki.</i>

38
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,270
Gohan! Kuririn is in bad shape,
too! Both of them are near death!

39
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,880
They're close, where those
three other huge <i>ki</i> are gathered.

40
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,680
I'll be right there. Just hang in there.

41
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,450
Now's the time when I show off the results

42
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,220
of the 100-times gravity
training I went through.

43
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,840
Gohan...

44
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,980
K-Kakarrot, you bastard... are you finally here?

45
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,850
Goku...

46
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,890
Kuririn, I'll give you a
senzu bean right away too, okay?

47
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,260
Okay, Gohan, here's a senzu. Eat it.

48
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,260
Gohan! Hey, Gohan!

49
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,200
It's no good. Your neck is
broken, and you're barely breathing.

50
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,030
All right, that's okay,
Daddy will feed it to you.

51
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:58,200
H-Hey! Who are you?!

52
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,040
One of those kids' friends?

53
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,040
I'm going to force it down, okay?

54
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,610
He just up and shows up in front of us.

55
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,620
Who is this guy? He was pretty fast.

56
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,620
That bastard might be
even faster than you, huh?

57
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,920
Ha! Stop joking around.

58
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,960
Don't count me alongside that
guy with the trash-level battle power.

59
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,630
Yo! Can you stand?

60
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,630
F-Father!

61
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,640
D-Did you come for us?

62
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,240
Hey, that kid who was nearly dead is now...!

63
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,240
H-How did he do that?

64
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,640
Are you okay, Gohan?

65
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,250
Father, be careful! Those guys are...

66
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,650
Hold on, Gohan.

67
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,850
I have to go give Kuririn a senzu, too.

68
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,990
O-Okay...

69
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,990
You had a real rough
time of it, didn't you, Gohan?

70
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:55,020
Yes, I was helpless.

71
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,200
Why has Vegeta taken such heavy damage, too?

72
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,010
He was beaten up by
that pineapple-headed one.

73
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,140
That guy has incredible strength.

74
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,750
Goku...

75
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,420
Kuririn, sorry to keep you waiting.

76
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,150
Here's a senzu.

77
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,630
I'm sort of happy, and yet sort of unhappy...

78
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,660
Unhappy?

79
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,200
Again?!

80
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,200
He's recovered, as well.

81
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,640
W-What is going on here?

82
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,380
What the hell did they...?

83
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,980
Goku, you must know how
strong those guys are, right?

84
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,550
The senzu may have restored us,

85
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,550
but we're just going to get done in again.

86
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,360
As disappointing as it is to say,

87
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,990
this is too much for even you to handle, Goku.

88
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,260
Those guys' strength is in a whole other league.

89
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,560
Even Vegeta is absolutely no match for them.

90
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,570
Oh, right, right...

91
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,440
Now that you mention it,
why was Vegeta beaten up by them?

92
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,570
Ain't they on the same side?

93
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah, apparently, they
used to be on the same side...

94
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,580
You don't have to talk. Let me probe you.

95
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,180
P-Probe?

96
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,160
F-Father?

97
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,520
I see...

98
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,960
I understand a lot now.

99
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,890
Like how you two have
raised your powers so much,

100
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,000
and how Bulma is safe.

101
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,130
The way the Dragon Balls were
taken from you, this Freeza guy,

102
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,130
and those guys over there, as well.

103
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,570
Y-You're kidding, right?!
How could you know that?!

104
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,810
I don't know. I just had a feeling
that if I did that, I would know.

105
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,150
Apparently, Vegeta is the same nasty
guy as ever, but whatever the reasons,

106
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,990
it looks like he saved your
lives during this fight, huh?

107
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,190
W-When did you gain this ability?

108
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:45,200
There's only one senzu left, huh?

109
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,150
Vegeta!

110
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,530
Eat that!

111
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,530
That was the last one, right? Why?

112
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,370
Father...

113
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,180
What is this? My body is...!

114
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,580
T-That was stupid!

115
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,550
Were you planning to heal
him and have the four of us fight?

116
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,150
That won't do any good!

117
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,560
That ain't why.

118
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,560
I want to settle the
score with him later on Earth.

119
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,000
S-Settle the score
with him later? You mean...?

120
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,560
Yeah.

121
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,570
H-Hey!

122
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,170
I'm going to take care of these guys alone!

123
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,770
Take care of them alone?!

124
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,550
Father!

125
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,260
You're going to take care of us alone, you say?

126
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,020
You're a strange bastard.

127
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,400
What is he thinking?
He hasn't gone crazy, has he?

128
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,630
Whatever he does,
there's no way he can beat them.

129
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:03,610
W-What's wrong with you, Father?

130
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,410
At least make this a little bit entertaining.

131
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:16,010
Hey, how much battle
power does this trash bug have?

132
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,220
He really <i>is</i> a trash bug!

133
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,620
His battle power is only about 5000!

134
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,970
Oh, that's disappointing.
He's just a big grandstander, huh?

135
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:40,670
This is strange, all right.
Why is he so unusually calm?

136
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,410
Doesn't he know what his
opponent's capabilities are?

137
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,080
That can't be right.

138
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,020
But I don't sense even a
trace of bloodlust from him.

139
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,990
D-Don't tell me!

140
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,160
That bastard...

141
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,590
Hey, hey, hey, are you all right?

142
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,540
What are you trying to do with
a battle power as puny as that?

143
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:27,020
–J-Just a minute, I say!
–M-My Gohan<i>-chan</i> is in
trouble! I can't just sit around!

144
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,820
This is it, right? Go on,
hurry and call Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

145
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,060
I-I don't know what sort of
intuition or whatever you've felt,

146
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,030
but there's no need to panic.

147
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,630
Hurry it up!

148
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,160
O-Okay...

149
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:49,970
Hey, Bulma, do you read me? Hey, I say!

150
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,980
Hey!

151
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,980
I-It's from Dad.

152
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,150
Hello? Dad?

153
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,150
Is that you, Bulma?

154
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,080
What's happened to Son<i>-kun</i>?!
When is he going to arrive?

155
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,750
It's been six days already!

156
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,390
What, hasn't he arrived yet? That's strange.

157
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:08,490
Maybe I messed up my calculations.

158
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,760
What about Gohan<i>-chan</i>?!
How is Gohan<i>-chan</i> doin?!

159
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,000
Chichi<i>-san...</i>

160
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,570
Is he safe? Tell me he's safe!

161
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,740
I-I don't know if he is!

162
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,310
<i>I'm</i> the one who wants to
know what's going on here.

163
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:43,190
Huh? This guy is crazy, all right.

164
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,630
He's about to be killed,
and here he is, smiling.

165
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,230
You can't beat me.

166
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,810
I can tell without even fighting you.

167
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,540
Of all the things he might have said!

168
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,550
Hey! Did you hear that?

169
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:04,490
This trash bug is talking outrageously big!

170
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,120
H-He's funny in the head, all right.

171
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,160
He was never the sort to talk big, either.

172
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,130
Father, you don't, by any chance, not
realize your opponent's power, do you?

173
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:23,070
D-Don't tell me! No, that can't be possible!

174
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,170
There's no way that
lower-class fighter Kakarrot...

175
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,610
...could ever become a legendary Super Saiyan!

176
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:36,350
I can't take any more jokes from
such a deeply stupid bastard as you.

177
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:41,160
I'll shut you up forever in no time flat.

178
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:47,160
T-They say that Super Saiyans
appear only once in a millennium.

179
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:52,500
A Super Saiyan, who can surpass barriers
that even the most gifted warriors cannot...

180
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,740
It couldn't be...
that's just a ridiculous fable!

181
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,000
E-Even if the legend is true,

182
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,140
<i>I'm</i> the only one who has the
potential to become a Super Saiyan!

183
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,280
Okay, are you ready?

184
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:51,190
<i>Ginyu Special Corps, ReaCoom Mach...</i>

185
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,200
<i>...Punch!!</i>

186
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,240
Whoop-oop-oop-oop-oop...

187
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,340
He vanished!

188
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:08,910
Huh? This can't be... He's nowhere.

189
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,470
W-What the...?

190
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,890
H-Hey, what the hell is this?

191
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,220
What?!

192
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,360
W-Why, you!

193
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,520
When did you manage to...?

194
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,930
What?!

195
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:31,930
He's over there?!

196
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,400
<i>Looks like Vegeta is the only</i>
<i>one who caught where Goku was.</i>

197
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,310
<i>W-Was he able to see him move just now?</i>

198
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,450
You guys are in league with
that bad guy Freeza too, aren't you?

199
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,250
You can get away now without getting hurt.

200
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,920
You'd better get out of here.

201
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,440
W-What the...?

202
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,580
W-Why, you bastard!

203
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,110
Looks like you're pretty
sure of your speed, at least.

204
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,820
But no matter how long this lasts,

205
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,320
you can't win if all you ever do is run away.

206
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,490
All right, if that's how you want it,
let me show you my best move.

207
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,620
I'll warn you, though,

208
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,490
no matter how fast you run
away, it won't do you any good.

209
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,260
After all, ReaCoom<i>-sama</i> is going to blow away

210
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,330
anything within a fairly widespread area.

211
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,940
<i>We'll find out what Kakarrot's</i>
<i>true worth is this time.</i>

212
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,880
Have you made your peace?

213
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,480
I'm going to send all four
of you into the next world!

214
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,200
<i>ReaCoom...</i>

215
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,930
Y-Y-Yikes!

216
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,770
<i>...Ultra...</i>

217
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,340
<i>...Fighting...</i>

218
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:26,710
<i>...Miracle...</i>

219
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,090
Sorry about that.

220
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,360
You just left yourself so
wide open, I couldn't help it.

221
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,200
Sorry, sorry.

222
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,570
Y-Y-You b-bastard...

223
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,240
D-Did Father defeat him?

224
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,010
H-He couldn't have... They're kidding, right?

225
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,250
However much that attack took him by surprise,

226
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,920
he took the guy that Vegeta and
we couldn't do anything against,

227
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,660
no matter how hard we attacked him...

228
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,260
...with... with just one blow...

229
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,860
W-What's going on? ReaCoom is...

230
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,500
That attack should have been nothing.

231
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,870
D-Damn it all!

232
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:36,120
T-That was no ordinary attack!
You can't fool my eyes!

233
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,910
<i>That was an incredibly heavy strike!</i>

234
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,640
<i>H-He's clearly beyond a Saiyan combat level.</i>

235
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,350
<i>But exactly why is he?</i>

236
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,420
<i>What the hell kind of</i>
<i>special training did he do?</i>

237
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,490
<i>Is the legend true?</i>

238
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:22,490
<i>Is he... is he... a Super Saiyan?!</i>

239
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,500
<i>The Super Saiyan...</i>

240
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:31,030
<i>Had Goku now become the legendary</i>
<i>warrior that even Vegeta held in awe?</i>

241
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

242
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

243
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,870
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

244
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:05,370
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

245
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,880
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

246
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

247
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

248
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,120
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

249
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,600
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

250
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

251
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

252
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

253
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

254
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,410
<i>So sorry.</i>

255
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

256
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

257
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,310
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

258
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,410
<i>What are you guys going to do? Are</i>
<i>you going to go back to your own planet?</i>

259
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,910
<i>Or would you rather be</i>
<i>knocked flat, like ReaCoom?</i>

260
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,080
<i>H-He has an incredible battle power!</i>
<i>How does he have that kind of power?</i>

261
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,980
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

262
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,720
<i>"Lightning Balls of Red and Blue!</i>
<i>Jheese and Butta Attack Goku."</i>

263
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,870
<i>Father, are you really a Super Saiyan?</i>

264
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:38,270
"Next time"
