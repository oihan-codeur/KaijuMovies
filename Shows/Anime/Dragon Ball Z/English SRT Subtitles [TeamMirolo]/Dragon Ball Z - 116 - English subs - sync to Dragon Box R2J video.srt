How dare you trample on
my dream of a Utopian world?!

00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:56,535
Suck it in! Swallow the Heavenly

K-Kami<i>-sama</i>!

Damn!

29
00:04:21,965 --> 00:04:26,835
If we don't beat him, then dispersing
the Ultra Holy Water won't matter!

00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:34,635
Piccolo!

Kami<i>-sama</i>!

00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,725
W-What is happening now?

33
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:38,105
Don't know. Probably Garlic Jr. behind it.

34
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:46,105
T-The Dead Zone?

35
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:51,315
How can he use that technique again?!

36
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:24,415
Once I finish you off, I will
revive my Demon Clansmen,

37
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:27,415
and rule the world!

38
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:32,755
As long as I have the Makyo
World, my power is unbounded!

39
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:36,155
I will continue to spread
terror and hopelessness...

40
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:38,565
...by the effects of the Makyo World!

41
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,065
It's no use!

42
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:50,635
Gohan, not even you can
blast your way through him now!

43
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:55,945
G-Gohan... The Makyo World...

44
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:11,795
You have to destroy the Makyo
World, the source of his power!

45
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:15,265
There's no way he can
handle something like that!

46
00:07:15,305 --> 00:07:19,065
It's all he can do to generate this Shield.

47
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,765
It's the only way...

48
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:30,645
Y-You don't mean...
he has to remove this Shield?!

49
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:34,815
Do it, Gohan! At this rate, no one will survive!

50
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:41,955
How long do you think
you can stand up to this?

51
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:08,445
You can regret your
foolishness in this endless hell!

52
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:22,755
W-What are you loafing around for, Gohan?!

53
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,095
Hurry and blast the Makyo World!

54
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:29,935
But the moment I remove this Shield,

55
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:34,105
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, you and Kuririn<i>-san</i>
will be drawn into the Dead Zone!

56
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:36,435
Blast it, Gohan!

57
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,115
Gohan! Remove the Shield!

58
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:45,675
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

59
00:09:45,715 --> 00:09:47,745
We don't matter!

60
00:09:47,785 --> 00:09:54,125
You're the only one who can
stop Garlic Jr.'s evil designs, Gohan!

61
00:09:55,165 --> 00:10:00,125
I... I couldn't do such a thing!!

62
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:49,475
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

63
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,135
What's this?

64
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:19,975
Have ancient Kami<i>-sama</i> forgiven Kami<i>-sama</i>?

65
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,455
You rotten bunch of know-nothings!

66
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,665
Haven't you figured
out yet why I've done this?

67
00:12:43,495 --> 00:12:45,485
W-What's that?!

68
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:52,165
Where are we?

69
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:55,465
Kami!

70
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,135
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>!

71
00:13:03,185 --> 00:13:04,815
My power!

72
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:07,945
My power is back to normal!

73
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:09,815
Why, you...!

74
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:17,665
You fool! You have returned
just so that you could die!

75
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,415
Piccolo!

76
00:13:44,155 --> 00:13:45,645
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

77
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,195
So you've chosen your own death?

78
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:13,515
<i>Stay alive just a little longer, Kami!</i>

79
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:16,015
P-Piccolo!

80
00:14:22,925 --> 00:14:26,925
Idiot! What are you planning?

81
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:34,765
Fine, then!

82
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:39,805
If you want to rush your death,
that's up to you. Go to hell!

83
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:58,455
Now, Gohan! Blast it!

84
00:14:58,495 --> 00:14:59,855
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

85
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:01,125
Blast it, Gohan!

86
00:15:01,165 --> 00:15:06,195
Now, while Piccolo has his attention!

87
00:15:06,235 --> 00:15:07,505
But...

88
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,475
There's no time, Gohan!

89
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,815
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

90
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,485
Fall! Fall!

91
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:47,805
Is this all you've got?

92
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:49,835
W-What?!

93
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:53,015
You think you're clever?!

94
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:03,565
Annoying insects!

95
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,135
Now! Gohan!

96
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:16,305
Blast it!

97
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:18,005
What?!

98
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,595
O-Oh hell, no!

99
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:30,105
<i>Wherever you may be,</i>
<i>I'm going to find you, Kakarrot!</i>

100
00:17:30,145 --> 00:17:34,245
<i>I'll teach you who the Number</i>
<i>One Saiyan in the universe is!</i>

101
00:18:01,585 --> 00:18:06,785
Ahem, have I done anything... inappropriate?

102
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:14,785
Of all the...

103
00:18:14,825 --> 00:18:17,495
Where's Gohan<i>-chan</i> gone off to?

104
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:21,495
What does he mean by
leavin' me in such a place?

105
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:27,275
You there!

106
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:34,445
You guys stop spendin' all your time
ridin' those useless toys, and study some!

107
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:36,215
Right!

108
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,895
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

109
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,565
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

110
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:07,805
Piccolo<i>-san</i>! Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

111
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,855
Kami<i>-sama</i>! Mister Popo!

112
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,425
Thank goodness! You've survived!

113
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:32,165
Yeah, somehow or another...

114
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:35,175
Hey... Gohan...

115
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,405
Move it, would you?

116
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:49,615
Yo, everyone.

117
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:58,585
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

118
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:02,395
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, thank goodness!

119
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:07,735
Boy, that was a real close one there!

120
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:10,975
It's thanks to you
destroying the Makyo World!

121
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:26,185
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

122
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:30,955
If that rotten Garlic's
body hadn't gotten smaller,

123
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:34,465
we would have been drawn
into the Dead Zone instead.

124
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:35,795
I see.

125
00:20:35,835 --> 00:20:41,465
At the moment Garlic Jr. lost the
power he was using to brace himself,

126
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:45,105
he could no longer endure the struggle!

127
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:47,445
With the Makyo World destroyed,

128
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:50,815
there's no way he can
possibly revive himself.

129
00:20:54,485 --> 00:20:57,155
He really was an idiot.

130
00:20:58,155 --> 00:21:05,155
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, even without
Father around, we won, huh?

131
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:10,565
Against an opponent the likes of
Garlic Jr., we don't need his power.

132
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:13,005
B-But...

133
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:18,665
Ordinarily, you would have
been a match for him by yourself.

134
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:22,115
Forgive me.

135
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:26,985
I will keep training.

136
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:42,795
Gohan!

137
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:46,805
You've done well, Gohan.

138
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:20,735
<i>Garlic Jr.'s latest designs had been thwarted.</i>

139
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:24,135
<i>As such, it was thought that everyone...</i>

140
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:28,015
<i>...would continue spending</i>
<i>their days in peace. However...</i>

<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

143
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

144
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

145
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

149

<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

150
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

151
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

152
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

153
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

154
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

155
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

156
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,565
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

157
00:24:12,115 --> 00:24:14,215
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

158
00:24:14,255 --> 00:24:16,785
<i>Kuririn, you're gonna</i>
