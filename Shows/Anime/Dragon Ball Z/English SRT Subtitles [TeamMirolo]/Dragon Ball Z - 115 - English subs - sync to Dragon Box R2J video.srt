Piccolo! Your body...

24
00:04:23,895 --> 00:04:27,995
S-Something must be
happening to that wretched Kami.

25

K-Kami<i>-sama...</i>

K-Kami<i>-sama...</i>

28
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:41,935
So this is the revered form of the Kami
that formerly governed over the Earth?

29
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:45,815
You all are exalted,
all-powerful, all-knowing Kami?

30
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,645
How shameful for you!!

31
00:05:56,555 --> 00:06:01,555
It is true, I am born of Planet
Namek, an alien to this world.

32
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:06,765
It is true that I have
been an inferior Kami to you.

33
00:06:10,105 --> 00:06:16,235
However, I love this
Earth more than any of you,

34
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:20,075
and have the same love
for all living things upon it!

35
00:06:20,115 --> 00:06:25,915
My hope is to be able to die for those people!

36
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:28,145
I will be allowed...

37
00:06:28,185 --> 00:06:32,185
...to pour out this Ultra Holy Water
into the hole of the air currents.

38
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:51,935
Why don't you just... die!

39
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:14,965
You did it! You did it, Gohan!

40
00:07:15,005 --> 00:07:17,965
Gohan! Don't let your guard down!

41
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,475
Right!

42
00:07:55,645 --> 00:07:57,615
I-It can't be!

43
00:08:01,345 --> 00:08:04,845
That was quite an attack just now.

44
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:08,845
Even I thought I saw into the
world of the dead for a moment.

45
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:10,755
I-Impossible!

46
00:08:10,795 --> 00:08:13,625
How can he still be alive in his state?

47
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:14,825
Have you forgotten?

48
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:19,125
He has... Garlic Jr. has eternal life!

49
00:08:34,845 --> 00:08:36,315
This is a nightmare.

50
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:43,145
Now it's my turn to lead off!

51
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:51,755
Piccolo!

52
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,455
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

53
00:09:27,035 --> 00:09:28,925
Worthless idiot!

54
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:31,635
What do you expect to do in your condition?

55
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:53,125
Dammit!

56
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:06,265
Brat!

57
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,965
Now then...

58
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:16,645
P-Piccolo, if I had a little
more power remaining,

59
00:10:16,685 --> 00:10:20,675
I may have been able to protect you.

60
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:28,585
To think that it would come
to me needing your protection!

61
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,465
How low I've sunk!

62
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:37,265
T-Thanks a lot!

63
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:42,935
But I'll try to extend
yours and Kami<i>-sama</i>'s life,

64
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,605
even if just by a little bit.

65
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,275
Even I...

66
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:50,475
...can be of use, right?

67
00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:16,465
Why, you!

68
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:58,045
After everything else, you attack with this?

69
00:12:00,025 --> 00:12:01,615
What are you...?

70
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:31,445
I-It's no use!

71
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:52,365
You'll pay!

72
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:55,135
You're gonna pay for that!

73
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:01,115
You piece of crap!

74
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:16,455
I'll kill you an inch at a time!

75
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:27,305
I'm going to kill you so very painfully!

76
00:13:32,315 --> 00:13:34,145
K-Kuririn!

77
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:12,175
Piccolo... stop!

78
00:14:15,325 --> 00:14:17,255
Haven't you died yet?

79
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,945
I'll send you both to Hell at the same time!

80
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:29,585
What do you think you're doing, you lech?!

81
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,425
Who're you callin' a lech?!

82
00:15:31,465 --> 00:15:34,455
Lady, it's your fault for tossin' in yer sleep!

83
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:40,665
Look, look! What a pretty sunrise!

84
00:15:49,645 --> 00:15:52,245
How lovely!

85
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,775
Huh? Karin<i>-chan</i>, what are you doing?

86
00:15:56,625 --> 00:16:00,785
<i>How much longer? There's no time left!</i>

87
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:09,265
There, there, that's the spot...

88
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:11,325
Now stop doing that!

89
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,195
It's the kid, huh?

90
00:16:46,635 --> 00:16:50,935
Shoot him! Gohan!

91
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:52,435
But...

92
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,775
Shoot him!

93
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:59,645
Blast him into so many pieces
there won't be anything left!

94
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,155
Gohan! Do it!

95
00:17:07,695 --> 00:17:09,425
Hurry up!

96
00:17:24,015 --> 00:17:25,635
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

97
00:17:25,675 --> 00:17:27,545
Popo, here.

98
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:30,315
Get this Ultra Holy Water to
the hole with the air currents!

99
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:32,645
They're only after me.

100
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:36,085
Kami<i>-sama</i>, no use! No time!

101
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:39,355
If don't run away, Kami<i>-sama</i> will die!

102
00:17:39,395 --> 00:17:44,385
Silence! If you don't hurry,
you're fired as my assistant!

103
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:57,335
D-Don't worry about me! Go, quickly!

104
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,705
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>!

105
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:04,415
Go! Get going!

106
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:07,285
Shoot him!

107
00:18:07,325 --> 00:18:09,445
Gohan! Shoot!

108
00:18:22,665 --> 00:18:24,635
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

109
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:28,635
What are you doing?! Hurry up!

110
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,765
Go!!

111
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:40,355
Shoot!!

112
00:19:14,025 --> 00:19:16,215
Curse you all!

113
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:54,325
What's that?!

114
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:57,335
You did it, Kami!

115
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:06,865
I-It's... it's okay now.

116
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:37,455
Why, you...

117
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:46,905
How dare you trample on
my dream of a Utopian world?!

118
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,945
Don't think you're
going to get away with this!

119
00:21:24,655 --> 00:21:27,615
Damn! Not that again!

120
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:34,255
Suck it in! Swallow the Heavenly
Realm and everything in it, Dead Zone!

121

Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

Kid! You really think that will protect you?

123
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,775
I'm sure you all remember!

124
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:56,605
A space that numbs your body and mind,

125
00:21:56,645 --> 00:22:01,645
where not even a single ray of
light may enter! The Dead Zone!
