<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,380
Six days? I can get there in just six days?

17
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:13,790
<i>Son Goku had finally blasted</i>
<i>off into space for Planet Namek.</i>

18
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,630
<i>However, at the same time, on Namek...</i>

19
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,600
D-Dragon Balls!

20
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,580
<i>Having at last found the</i>
<i>Namekians, as well as the Dragon Balls,</i>

21
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,640
<i>they had already fallen into enemy hands.</i>

22
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:54,260
<i>"Surprise Attack!!</i>
<i>The Elder's Target Was the Scouters."</i>

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,760
Come on! Unless you want to die, get moving!

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,170
I told you to step forward further!

25
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,370
Hey, hey, snap to it!

26
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,950
What are they planning
to do with the Namekians?

27
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,350
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>, are those all Saiyans?

28
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,790
No, they're not. They're wearing the
same battle dress, but they're not Saiyans.

29
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,360
Besides, Vegeta is supposed
to be the only remaining Saiyan.

30
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,360
Not including Goku or yourself.

31
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,370
T-Then...

32
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,800
Come to think of it, there was that
guy who said he was Goku's brother.

33
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,970
Our task is to go through space,
searching for planets with good environments,

34
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,370
and once we've exterminated
those who already live there,

35
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,780
we sell them for a high price to
aliens who are looking for a suitable planet.

36
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,050
It could be that these
guys are in league with them.

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,320
Though if so, I don't see Vegeta around.

38
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,730
Is he off somewhere else,
looking for Dragon Balls?

39
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:21,740
My name is Freeza, and as you can see,
I am gathering your so-called Dragon Balls.

40
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,750
Incidentally, where are the
others? According to our survey,

41
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,190
there are supposed to be ten of you here.

42
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,930
You intend not to say anything, do you?

43
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,770
I will kill you.

44
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,720
6,588...

45
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:10,290
6,590... Whew...
20-times gravity sure is tough...

46
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,930
But I have to thoroughly retrain
myself, starting from the fundamentals...

47
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,810
...or I won't be able to
bear multiple <i>Kaio-ken</i> levels...

48
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,770
Now, I shall have your answer, please.

49
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,850
Not in Namekian. Speak to us in a
language that we can all understand.

50
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,290
We know that you are able to speak it.

51
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,090
T-The others are out working the fields.

52
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:21,700
Only those of us who are
elderly or children remain here.

53
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,100
There you go. As long as you
answer me honestly like that,

54
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,870
I will not do anything to you.

55
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,310
Now then, I will continue
to have you answer me, please.

56
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,750
Where is your Dragon Ball?

57
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,350
I believe there is another one here.

58
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,890
I-I don't know.
We don't have anything like that.

59
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,320
Dodoria<i>-san</i>?

60
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,320
Sir?

61
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,730
As I recall, the second Namekian that we killed

62
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,660
said something quite interesting, yes?

63
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,230
Yes. "We can only turn over the Dragon Balls
to those who we judge to be men of valor."

64
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,870
Yes, yes. He was a very stubborn man, too.

65
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,840
I simply could not get
him to cooperate with me...

66
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,850
...but then I killed one of
them, to serve as a lesson to him.

67
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,290
What?!

68
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,520
Once I did, I got him
to say all sorts of things.

69
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,890
The seven Dragon Balls were
created by the Grand Elder of this world.

70
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:26,860
Each of them is in the
custody of one of seven Elders.

71
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:31,270
Each one is to engage in a
contest of wits, a contest of strength,

72
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,700
and to ask the reason for one's wish.

73
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,710
And once each Elder
judges you to be a man of valor,

74
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,710
you are at last able to obtain
their Dragon Ball, or so he told me.

75
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,880
Well, I attempted to do as I was instructed,

76
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,050
but he told me that he was
absolutely unwilling to turn his over to me.

77
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,120
I could not help but kill him.

78
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,690
H-How could you do that?!

79
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,260
<i>And so, it took some</i>
<i>effort to find the first Ball.</i>

80
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,940
<i>The next three were easy.</i>
<i>Everyone was very accommodating.</i>

81
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,640
I see. So that's it, huh?

82
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,650
A-Accommodating, you say?

83
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,650
You are lying!

84
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,050
T-That's right! There's no way
the other Elders would obligingly

85
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,650
hand over their Dragon Balls to you!

86
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,060
Oh, no, they became quite
accommodating once we did this.

87
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,090
Zarbon<i>-san</i>, please show them.

88
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,470
Yes, sir.

89
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,140
–Why, you!
–No, don't!

90
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,870
H-How could they do that?!

91
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,470
That was awful!

92
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,640
Gohan, control your <i>ki</i>, or they'll find us.

93
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,010
But I can't take this!

94
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,010
Still, you want to bring Piccolo
and everyone else back to life, right?

95
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,580
That's not the sort of opponent
that we can stand up against.

96
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,650
If we come forward now,
we'd just die for nothing.

97
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,650
Darn it!

98
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,960
And here, after we've come
all the way to Planet Namek...

99
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:14,570
How about it? Are you feeling
a little more accommodating?

100
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
What is your purpose in
gathering the Dragon Balls?

101
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,090
Oh, it is just a trivial little wish.
I would like to obtain eternal life.

102
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,600
What?! Then, he and Vegeta
are both after eternal life?

103
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,600
Maybe they aren't friends with Vegeta, then.

104
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,240
I don't know.

105
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,120
I would not turn over the Dragon Ball to the
likes of you, even if it meant my own death!

106
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,980
So you mean that you would
choose death over handing it over to me?

107
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:12,690
I see. The people of this planet
do seem to be quite stubborn.

108
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,160
However...

109
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,600
...will you still be so stubborn
after the deaths of those children?

110
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,500
W-What?!

111
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,170
You would even kill children?!

112
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,970
Oh, no! Hide!

113
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,330
There's a strong battle power...

114
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,360
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, over there.

115
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,420
Oh, you've come for us?

116
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,870
Namekians!

117
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,900
They've come to save them!

118
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,130
Damn! Then our bad
feeling turned out to be true!

119
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:42,570
This <i>is</i> trouble. Here I was, just about
to have the Dragon Ball brought out to me,

120
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,740
when you interrupt your work...

121
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,640
...just to come here to be killed.

122
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,910
I see now. So the rumors about
someone attacking the villages

123
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,150
and taking the Dragon Balls are true, are they?

124
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:04,120
You're going to pay for this!
Trample on the peace of Namek, will you?!

125
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,740
Be careful fighting them!
These guys are quite strong!

126
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,540
Good luck!

127
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:28,280
Oh, you plan to fight, do you?
I wonder how much battle power they have.

128
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,780
Dodoria<i>-san</i>?

129
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,820
Yes sir, I will check.

130
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:48,540
Please do not be discouraged, sir.
All three are around 1,000.

131
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,280
We will not even be needed to fight them.

132
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,690
<i>So that's it. I get it.</i>

133
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,060
<i>So that's how they can</i>
<i>pinpoint the few small villages</i>

134
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,660
<i>that dot the vast surface of Namek.</i>

135
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,230
<i>It's because they can</i>
<i>search for us with those devices.</i>

136
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,670
9,998...

137
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,240
9,999...

138
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,110
10,000...

139
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,760
I'm so hungry...

140
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:15,090
<i>Vegeta, and someone even more</i>
<i>incredible than him, are up ahead...</i>

141
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,500
All right!

142
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,110
This is laughable! You want to tangle
with us with a battle power of 1,000?!

143
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:41,250
Not true. Those three are just suppressing
their <i>ki.</i> Don't they even know that?

144
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,490
The Saiyans were surprised about that, too, huh?

145
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,930
Get them!

146
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,470
What is this? You call
<i>that</i> a battle power of 1,000?

147
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,270
What's going on here? All three
of them have increased to 3,000.

148
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,590
Way to go! Awesome!

149
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,420
Hang in there!

150
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,430
Oh, my, they fight pretty well, do they not?

151
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,030
I've got it. The Namekians are a
race that can control their battle powers.

152
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,430
That's not a type you see very often.

153
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,270
Way to go! Hang in there!
Go on! Go on! Let them have it!

154
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,420
<i>All right, including his, there are only</i>
<i>three devices that have not been destroyed.</i>

155
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Children, stand back from me.

156
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,630
Quickly!

157
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,070
Dodoria<i>-san...</i>

158
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,470
Yes, sir.

159
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:48,870
Those guys are pathetic.

160
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,680
Now I have to be put out.

161
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,980
May I take care of all three of them?

162
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,890
Feel free.

163
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:28,480
Y-You bastard, you think you can
defeat me with such a puny technique?

164
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,350
Elder!

165
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,340
No! He was targeting the Scouters!

166
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,510
Scouters?

167
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:03,610
Those devices that can tell
your opponent's strength and location!

168
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:11,250
So that's it! Then they can't tell
precisely where the Dragon Balls are, after all!

169
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,990
Using those Scouter things, they just searched
out Namekians, then forced them out of them!

170
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,470
That old man knew that, so that's
why he destroyed all of their Scouters!

171
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,300
Why, you–!

172
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,450
I-I'll kill you all...

173
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,460
I'll kill you all!

174
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,390
I'll kill each and every one of you!

175
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:53,900
Elder! Look out!

176
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,590
<i>The Elder had made a quick-witted attack.</i>
<i>However, it has set the enemy's fury ablaze.</i>

177
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:30,270
<i>Can Gohan and Kuririn do nothing but watch on?</i>

178
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

179
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

180
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,860
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

181
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:05,360
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

182
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:11,870
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

183
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

184
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

185
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

186
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

187
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

188
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

189
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

190
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

191
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,410
<i>So sorry.</i>

192
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,550
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

193
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

194
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,600
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

195
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,700
<i>Control yourself, Gohan!</i>
<i>You can't take those guys on!</i>

196
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,610
<i>I am going to take you down!</i>

197
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,450
<i>This runt is my quarry!</i>
<i>The rest of you, stay out of this!</i>

198
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,420
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

199
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,850
<i>"Gohan in Peril!</i>
<i>A Pursuing Dodoria Summons Death."</i>

200
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:34,490
<i>Kuririn-san, let's fight him!</i>

201
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,220
"Next time"
"Gohan in Peril!
A Pursuing Dodoria Summons Death"
