<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:24,410
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,670
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:36,420
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:43,010
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:51,850
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,360
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:04,370
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,830
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:13,960
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,340
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:26,310
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:29,890
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:36,730
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,690
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,410
Now!!

17
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,590
W-What?!

18
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,720
Th-This can't be–!

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,150
<i>At last, Gohan had defeated Cell.</i>

20
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:23,860
<i>The battle was over, and</i>
<i>peace had returned to Earth.</i>

21
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,880
Please bring those people who
were killed by Cell back to life!

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,710
That is a simple matter.

23
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,260
<i>However, Goku did not come back to life.</i>

24
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,150
Once you all die, I'll see you again! Bye-Bye!

25
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:23,420
<i>And so, Trunks used his time machine</i>
<i>to return once again to the future.</i>

26
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,810
<i>"One More Conclusion!!</i>
<i>I Will Defend the Future."</i>

27
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:46,400
<i>Peace had returned to the Earth.</i>
<i>However, in the future that Trunks came from,</i>

28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,700
<i>the menace of the Artificial Humans</i>
<i>No. 17 and No. 18 still continued.</i>

29
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,730
Mom, I'm home!

30
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,230
Welcome back, Trunks.

31
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,610
Hold on, now...

32
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,030
What's going on here?

33
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,410
You're quite a bit taller, aren't you?

34
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,370
Yes. Mom, in Kami-<i>sama</i>'s Temple,

35
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,370
there's this place called
the Room of Spirit and Time,

36
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,370
and if you train in there, you can
pass an entire year in just one day.

37
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,380
I'm not entirely sure how that can be,

38
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,380
but in any case, I'm glad you got back safely.

39
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,210
So, how did it go?

40
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,220
Judging by the look on your face,
I'm guessing it went well.

41
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,130
Yes.

42
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,310
That must have been rough.

43
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,730
I see. So Son-<i>kun</i> ended up dying after all, huh?

44
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:52,110
But Gohan-<i>kun</i> avenged him, right?

45
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,990
Yes.

46
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,160
I also fought alongside Dad.

47
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,370
W-With Vegeta?

48
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:06,210
It turns out that Dad
wasn't just some cold person.

49
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:08,920
When I got killed by Cell...

50
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,100
Dammit!

51
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,830
...he got serious, and became furious.

52
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,330
S-Sure he did! Isn't that what I've told you?

53
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,460
Yes.

54
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,460
<i>Eh? Vegeta did? So he</i>
<i>did have that side to him...</i>

55
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,680
We interrupt this program
for an Artificial Human report.

56
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,350
No. 17 and No. 18 have appeared again.

57
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,470
They are currently attacking
at Point BBN-49, Parsley City!

58
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:09,190
Those miserable Artificial Humans!
This time, for sure...!

59
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,820
Trunks...

60
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,190
It's all right.

61
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,690
This is the reason I went to
go see Goku-<i>san</i> in the past.

62
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,660
This time for sure, I've got to
avenge Gohan-<i>san</i> and all the others!

63
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,800
It's not just the past–I've got
to bring peace to this era, as well.

64
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,380
Be careful, Trunks. Don't overdo it.

65
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,340
Right!

66
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,580
You're acting just like a brat.

67
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,410
To think you would get so upset
over losing at some computer game.

68
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,620
Shut up! You keep quiet!

69
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,880
Those two killed my wife and children...

70
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,060
Dammit...!

71
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,670
You're a pretty good shot, huh, geezer?

72
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,090
Should I give you a reward?

73
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,670
You want one, don't you? Eh?

74
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,760
Y-You devil!

75
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,110
Who's there?!

76
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,820
Trunks?

77
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,160
No. 17! No. 18!

78
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,830
This is the end for you!
I'm going to put you away!

79
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,160
What, you're still alive?

80
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,750
You know, nobody can pull off
wasted effort the way you can.

81
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,800
No. 17, I'm in a rotten mood!

82
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,800
I can go ahead and polish him off, can't I?

83
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,760
Because I'm sick of him!

84
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,600
It will mean one less
thing to amuse us, but okay.

85
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,680
Do as you like, No. 18.

86
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,690
This will be more fun than some computer game.

87
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,820
Watch out, No. 18!

88
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,580
Damn it!

89
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,330
Now you've done it!

90
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,730
What's wrong with you?
That was pretty sloppy, No. 18.

91
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,310
Damn! You're going to pay for that!

92
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,400
You've progressed quite a bit, huh?

93
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,320
Getting No. 18 genuinely angry at you, and all.

94
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,570
In the past, where I went in my time machine,

95
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,700
you were somewhat good people.

96
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,870
But here, in this time period,

97
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,910
you continue to destroy cities for
no reason, and torment everyone!

98
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,000
I cannot allow that to go on!

99
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,670
What are you blathering about?

100
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:03,210
Let's get him, No. 17!

101
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,340
Th-This can't be...!

102
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,720
H-How could No. 18 be
done in by the likes of you?

103
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,640
That was for all of my friends you've killed.

104
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,690
And this... is to avenge Gohan-<i>san</i>!

105
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,030
To hell with you!

106
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,130
<i>It's over.</i>

107
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,180
<i>No, not yet...</i>

108
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,640
<i>There's still one crucial person remaining.</i>

109
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,100
<i>And so, the months passed by.</i>

110
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,020
<i>No. 17 and No. 18 were gone,</i>
<i>along with the destruction they caused,</i>

111
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,810
<i>and peace had returned somewhat.</i>
<i>In the cities, reconstruction had begun.</i>

112
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,820
<i>And then, the amount of energy required</i>
<i>by the time machine for a round-trip journey</i>

113
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,610
<i>to the past had finally been stored up.</i>

114
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:37,040
Mom, I'm going to go report to
everyone that I defeated No. 17 and No. 18.

115
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,040
Trunks, be careful. Tell everyone I said hi, okay?

116
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,710
Okay, Mom.

117
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,500
Mom, get inside the house.

118
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:51,510
What is it? A visitor?

119
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,810
Ah! It must be a girlfriend, right?

120
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:01,180
When did you manage that, you sneaky little...?

121
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,110
I know you're there, Cell!

122
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,990
You're planning to kill me,

123
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,580
turn back into an egg,
get aboard my time machine,

124
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,580
then go back into the past, and
absorb No. 17 and No. 18, aren't you?

125
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,580
All to achieve your perfect form.

126
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,000
What?! H-How could you know that?

127
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,960
That plan is going to fail.
And then, it will all be over.

128
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,410
My plan will fail, you say?

129
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:58,120
Hmph, because of the likes of you?

130
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,370
Cell, in your perfect form, you did
indeed have astounding strength.

131
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,210
But as you are now, even I'm
strong enough to defeat you!

132
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,380
So that's it.

133
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,960
You've been to the past, haven't you?

134
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,300
I see. That explains why
you're so surprisingly informed.

135
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,010
Be that as it may, I don't see
how you could defeat me now.

136
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,980
Trunks, I know all the data
about you via the spy robot.

137
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,400
With your power,

138
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,150
you could not even defeat
No. 17 or No. 18, let alone myself.

139
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,990
Well then, why are No. 17
and No. 18 no longer around?

140
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,990
So that's why.

141
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:48,290
Then you're the reason why
those two have disappeared, huh?

142
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:54,130
Damn... You killed No. 17 and No. 18.

143
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,930
What you've done was uncalled-for!

144
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,970
Thanks to you, I cannot achieve
my perfect form in this era!

145
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,140
I'm going to have to kill you after all.

146
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,020
I'll kill you, then use the
time machine to go to the past,

147
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,610
and absorb No. 17 and No. 18 there!

148
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,110
It would be bad if we fought here in Metro West.

149
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,200
The reconstruction has
progressed quite a bit.

150
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,700
We're going to change locations!

151
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,980
What a rookie. It appears
you've gotten a little better.

152
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,900
But you're making a laughingstock
of yourself for trying to defeat me.

153
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,740
I am the ultimate Artificial Human
created by Doctor Gero-<i>sama</i>!

154
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:07,830
There's no way that anyone
in the world can defeat me!

155
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,290
We'll see about that.

156
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,600
There's no chance I'm
letting you go back into the past!

157
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,060
Enough!

158
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,080
Th-This isn't supposed to be!

159
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,790
Damn... I am the ultimate Artificial Human.

160
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:56,170
There's no way I should be losing to that child!

161
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,990
Cell! Not you...

162
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:26,160
For the sake of peace on Earth,
I cannot permit your existence!

163
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,030
W-Why, you...

164
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,610
If that's how you want it, you
can be stunned by this technique!

165
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,620
<i>Ka... me...</i>

166
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,990
<i>ha... me...</i>

167
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,170
May you be completely obliterated, Cell!

168
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,180
D-Damn it all.

169
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,050
Damn it all...!

170
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:48,200
<i>Now, it's all over. Thank you, everyone.</i>

171
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,370
<i>Thank you, Goku-san.</i>

172
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:26,950
Come on, Bubbles, Gregory!

173
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,400
Try catching me, already!

174
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,400
You guys are hopeless.

175
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,940
You ain't been exercising enough
lately, and have gotten too fat!

176
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,020
All done!

177
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,030
I'm impressed, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

178
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,380
Whoops! Kaio-<i>sama</i>, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

179
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,100
I don't have the heart to build it again.

180
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,100
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, this works out perfect, doesn't it?

181
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,190
I didn't feel like living here in the first place.

182
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,060
Let's go somewhere!

183
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:49,820
I know! Where are those
masters of the Next World?

184
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,910
The masters of the Next World?

185
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,660
No fair!

186
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,040
You promised you'd take me

187
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,210
to where the masters of the
Next World were, didn't you?

188
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,000
Or do you not know where they are?

189
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,840
No, of course I know where they are.

190
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,170
But Goku, over there, there'll be...

191
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,010
Let's go!

192
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,100
I want to meet these masters
of the Next World right away!

193
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,020
<i>And so, Goku and Kaio-sama's</i>
<i>tour of the Next World began.</i>

194
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,020
<i>Who were these masters of the</i>
<i>Next World that awaited Goku?</i>

195
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,500
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

196
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:54,300
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

197
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,720
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

198
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:05,180
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

199
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,730
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

200
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,820
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

201
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,330
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

202
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:21,950
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

203
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,460
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

204
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,550
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

205
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,380
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

206
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,390
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

207
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:45,100
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

208
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,230
<i>So sorry.</i>

209
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,400
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

210
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,410
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

211
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,840
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

212
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,720
<i>Say, Kaio-sama, what kind of dude</i>

213
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,380
<i>is the number-one guy in the Next World?</i>

214
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,720
<i>Now, see here! You can't refer to him as a dude!</i>

215
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,810
<i>He is the Grand Kaio, the</i>
<i>greatest man in the Next World.</i>

216
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,640
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

217
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,150
<i>"A Deep Impression!! There They Are!</i>
<i>The Next World's Awesome Dudes."</i>

218
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:33,360
<i>Huh? Father, you're going to</i>
<i>Hell with one of the other masters</i>

219
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,070
<i>to put down Cell?</i>

220
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,030
"Next time"
"A Deep Impression!! There They Are!
The Next World's Awesome Dudes"
