00:01:36,855 --> 00:01:38,775
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,865 --> 00:01:52,785

18

It seems that even with you really
putting out all the power you've got,

19
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:52,265
this is what your level is.

20
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:55,435
How damned disappointing! You pantywaist!

21
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,895
Here I came, wondering what
an exceptional guy you must be...

22
00:03:00,815 --> 00:03:03,945
Killing you has become a frivolous matter!

23
00:03:03,985 --> 00:03:06,065
Damn it to hell!!

24
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:09,235
Damn it to hell!!

25
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:12,325
Damn it to hell!!

26
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:15,995

<i>Kuririn's Handiwork in Destroying No. 18."</i>

N-No. 18 is in the area!

29
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:43,815
I-I can still...

30
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:49,985
...use this controller!
But where in the world is she?

31
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:53,695
I-I have to find No. 18 right away!

32
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:05,705
If she's found by Cell...

33
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,725
Damn it all!!

34
00:04:29,315 --> 00:04:31,695
Damn it all!!

35
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:40,825
I-Incredible...

36
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:18,035
I-If only I could become my perfect form...!

37
00:05:20,285 --> 00:05:22,415
If only I could become my perfect form,

38
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:25,705
t-the likes of that guy would be...!

39
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,265
So, what?

40
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:42,185
You're saying that if you
could become your perfect form,

41
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:44,685
you wouldn't be losing to me?

42
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:48,355
That's right! I absolutely would not lose!

43
00:05:48,395 --> 00:05:53,025
Power, speed, techniques,
brains, mental strength...!

44
00:05:53,065 --> 00:05:57,615
In all things, I will achieve a perfect existence!

45
00:05:57,655 --> 00:06:00,995
That's what the computer told me!

46
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,345
Dammit!

47
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:22,805
If only I could become my perfect form...!

48
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,685
Damn it all!!

49
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:41,865
Incredible...

50
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:44,665
When he fought with me,

51
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,835
could he have been purposely
pretending to be weaker?

52
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:51,005
No, there isn't any reason why
he would have had to do that.

53
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:55,005
Something has happened
during these last few days.

54
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,465
Something?

55
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:58,885
What the hell could have happened
where he would change that much?!

56
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:14,855
T-There she is! In a place such as this?

57
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:29,995
H-Haven't they realized it?
Either Cell or Vegeta?

58
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:31,875
Or Trunks?

59
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:38,045
With this, once I've shut
down No. 18's functions,

60
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:40,215
and then destroyed her,

61
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:42,385
Cell will be unable to
become his perfect form,

62
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,925
and we'll have beaten No. 18 as well!

63
00:07:47,885 --> 00:07:51,565
However, you have to draw to within 10 meters,

64
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:55,065
or it won't have any effect,
okay? Within 10 meters!

65
00:07:56,605 --> 00:07:58,445
All right!

66
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:24,765
I-If only I could absorb No. 18...!

67
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:48,745
<i>The man, No. 17, wasn't there.</i>
<i>Has he alone been absorbed?</i>

68
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:53,085
<i>That's how Cell has transformed</i>
<i>and powered up, I'll bet.</i>

69
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:37,455
<i>There they are! Somehow, I have to get closer–</i>

70
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:40,875
<i>within 10 meters of</i>
<i>them–without them noticing...</i>

71
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:44,295
<i>If I'm seen, it's all over.</i>

72
00:09:52,555 --> 00:09:56,685
<i>What am I thinking here,</i>
<i>at an important time like this?!</i>

73
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:12,655
<i>What a start! Don't scare me like that!</i>

74
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:17,665
<i>Ah, you fool! The Artificial Humans are there!</i>

75
00:10:34,595 --> 00:10:37,355
Despite the obvious gap between us,

76
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:41,565
you're saying that if you became
your perfect form, you would beat me?

77
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:46,695
I-I would unmistakably beat you!
If you're at that level, that is...

78
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:58,085
D-Dad, don't tell me...!

79
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,165
H-He can't mean to...!

80
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:02,375
No. 16, what's the matter?

81
00:11:02,415 --> 00:11:05,715
No. 18, do not worry about me,
run away at any time!

82
00:11:15,055 --> 00:11:17,725
You seem to be considering it...

83
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:26,445
How about it, Vegeta?

84
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:31,195
You Saiyans are a warrior
race through and through!

85
00:11:31,235 --> 00:11:34,205
Fighting is your passion!

86
00:11:34,245 --> 00:11:40,665
However, the stronger your opponent,
the greater the joy you take in fighting!

87
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:43,835
Isn't that so? Am I wrong?

88
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,885
You'd like to try fighting, wouldn't you...

89
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:51,675
against me, in my perfect form?

90
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:08,815
You must want to!

91
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:14,325
You are the prince of the
warrior race, the Saiyans, after all!

92
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:47,895
<i>Within 10 meters...</i>
<i>within 10 meters... just a bit farther...!</i>

93
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,925
<i>All right...</i>

94
00:13:25,265 --> 00:13:29,855
<i>E-Even if I use this controller to stop No. 18,</i>

95
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:33,155
<i>unless she's destroyed,</i>
<i>she'll be absorbed by Cell...!</i>

96
00:13:35,655 --> 00:13:37,785
<i>I think I can destroy her...</i>

97
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:41,245
<i>No. 16 doesn't hardly</i>
<i>seem able to move, and all...</i>

98
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:44,665
<i>T-This is the only chance there is!</i>

99
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:57,005
<i>No. 18 was originally just a cute human girl...</i>

100
00:13:59,095 --> 00:14:01,635
<i>If she hadn't been</i>
<i>reconstructed by Doctor Gero...</i>

101
00:14:02,685 --> 00:14:05,105
<i>I even feel sorry for her!</i>

102
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,065
<i>I wouldn't really have to destroy her...</i>

103
00:14:09,105 --> 00:14:12,065
<i>No! If she is absorbed by Cell,</i>

104
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:14,115
<i>and then Cell becomes his perfect form,</i>

105
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:17,775
<i>people all over the world might be killed!</i>

106
00:14:23,865 --> 00:14:25,245
<i>Destroy her...</i>

107
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:27,165
<i>Don't destroy her...</i>

108
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:32,625
<i>Destroy her... Don't destroy her...</i>
<i>Destroy her... Don't destroy her...</i>

109
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:38,045
<i>Destroy her... Destroy her...</i>
<i>Destroy her... Destroy her...</i>

110
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,435
–The water's just right, huh Gohan?
–Yes!

111
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:54,315
My fatigue feels like it's flying away!

112
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:01,785
So, I wonder how Kuririn-<i>san</i>
and the others are doing right now.

113
00:15:01,825 --> 00:15:06,665
Not knowing what's happening in the
world out front sure makes you uneasy.

114
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,285
Don't worry about it.

115
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:12,335
More importantly, be sure you massage
yourself well here in the hot water.

116
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,045
It takes the exhaustion away.

117
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,045
Right!

118
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:18,215
You know something, Gohan,
you're keeping up pretty good!

119
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:21,215
It's been just about two
months since we've come in here.

120
00:15:21,255 --> 00:15:22,845
Even so, Father,

121
00:15:22,885 --> 00:15:26,725
in the world outside,
only four hours have gone by!

122
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:28,855
It really is wondrous, huh?

123
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,065
This Room of Spirit and Time.

124
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:34,065
Yeah, it sure is.

125
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:37,565
Okay! I'm going to work hard
to become a Super Saiyan soon,

126
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:40,445
and become an opponent for you, Father!

127
00:15:46,285 --> 00:15:47,575
Now you've done it!

128
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:05,595
All right, Gohan!

129
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:08,605
Once we get out of the tub,
we'll eat, and then it's more training!

130
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:09,725
Right!

131
00:16:24,405 --> 00:16:28,915
<i>Destroy her... Don't destroy her... Destroy her...</i>

132
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:33,665
See ya!

133
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:47,265
Bye!

134
00:17:04,485 --> 00:17:09,205
<i>She was originally just a cute human girl...</i>

135
00:17:46,075 --> 00:17:47,575
You're...

136
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:57,625
<i>That couldn't be... an</i>
<i>emergency shutdown controller?</i>

137
00:17:57,665 --> 00:17:59,665
<i>Why would he...?</i>

138
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:09,845
Don't you want to try
fighting me in my perfect form,

139
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:12,515
prince of the warrior race?

140
00:18:18,855 --> 00:18:22,445
You certainly do understand Saiyans well.

141
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:29,245
Your cells are also included
within my body, after all.

142
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:31,365
That must be what it is...

143
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:35,205
That is indeed what it is.

144
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,255
Very well!

145
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:42,425
I will intentionally fall into your trap!

146
00:18:42,465 --> 00:18:45,595
You may become your perfect form. Go!

147
00:18:45,635 --> 00:18:47,055
Dad!

148
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,595
I would not be proud of
myself if I defeated you

149
00:18:49,635 --> 00:18:52,095
the pathetic way you are now.

150
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,775
Dad! You can't!
If you let him do that...

151
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:02,235
That's you're greatest fault, Dad!

152
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:04,355
Shut up, Trunks!

153
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:08,615
I'm not above fixing it so that you'll
never take that insolent tone with me again!

154
00:19:08,655 --> 00:19:11,245
You should know better than anyone

155
00:19:11,285 --> 00:19:14,245
how incredible the power
beyond Super Saiyan that I have is!

156
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:18,125
So, get going!

157
00:19:22,255 --> 00:19:24,755
I'm looking forward to this, Cell.

158
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:39,645
Dad may have let you go,
but I will not let you escape!

159
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:48,275
Bulma-<i>san</i>, you went to all that
trouble to make this for us. I'm sorry.

160
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:04,625
Get away safely!

161
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:09,005
No matter what, don't
get absorbed by Cell! Please!

162
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:18,015
Why?! Why did you break the controller?!

163
00:20:18,055 --> 00:20:22,185
It must have been your
chance, right? To destroy me?

164
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:25,225
T-That's...

165
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:28,985
Kid, move it!

166
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,195
If you have the time to interfere with me,

167
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:33,535
why not help out in searching for No. 18?

168
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:36,535
There will be no more need
for you to search for No. 18.

169
00:20:36,575 --> 00:20:40,535
–What?
–You are going to be
defeated by me, here and now!

170
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,335
What was that, you punk,
with your ass still blue?

171
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,755
Trunks! Do not interfere!

172
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:06,565
I thought I said I was going to squeeze
the life from you, right here and now!

173
00:21:06,605 --> 00:21:09,655
How about you just accept that and fight?!

174
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:12,695
Trunks! I told you to stop!

175
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,915
It's like Dad explained it–

176
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:31,925
I also possess nearly as
much power as he does!

177
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:35,255
With your power now, you
will not be winning against me!

178
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,885
Give it up!

179
00:21:39,595 --> 00:21:41,435
H-Hey, Vegeta!

180
00:21:41,475 --> 00:21:44,645
Do something with this guy, will you?

181
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:57,735
<i>No. 18! I-I've found you!</i>

182
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,125
No!!

183
00:22:08,295 --> 00:22:13,215
<i>At last, No. 18 has been discovered by Cell!</i>

184
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:18,635
<i>Will Kuririn's affections turn to their harm?</i>

185
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:23,435
<i>And what will be No. 18's destiny?</i>

186
00:22:43,325 --> 00:22:47,335
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

187
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:53,175
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

188
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:55,545
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

189
00:22:59,005 --> 00:23:04,015
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

190
00:23:06,345 --> 00:23:10,565
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

191
00:23:10,605 --> 00:23:14,655
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

192
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:18,155
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

193
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:20,785
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

194
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:28,285
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

195
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:32,415
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

196
00:23:32,455 --> 00:23:34,215
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

197
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:38,255
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

198
00:23:38,295 --> 00:23:43,935
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

199
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,095
<i>So sorry.</i>

200
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:51,225
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

201
00:23:53,985 --> 00:23:59,235
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

202
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,795
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

203
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:15,625
<i>No. 18, Cell has spotted you!</i>
<i>Get out of there, fast!</i>

204
00:24:15,665 --> 00:24:18,295
<i>I will prevent him from</i>
<i>getting his perfect form,</i>

205
00:24:18,335 --> 00:24:20,345
<i>even if I have to defeat you, Dad.</i>

206
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:23,135
<i>I've had enough hellish futures!</i>

207
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,175
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

208
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:29,685
<i>"A Shock to the Entire Universe!! Cell's</i>
<i>Spectacular Evolution Toward His Perfect Form."</i>

209
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:33,145
<i>Oh, no! No. 18 is going to be absorbed!</i>

210
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:35,815
"Next time"
"A Shock to the Entire Universe!! Cell's
Spectacular Evolution Toward His Perfect Form"
