Not bad, Goten!

48
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:54,385
You've managed to get a
lot better in just that short time.

49

Well, can you do this?

51

D-Don't tell me he's going to
launch a <i>Kikoha</i> blast from there?!

–I-It'll blow into the spectator seats!
–Don't do anything stupid!

Nah, it'll be okay.

54
00:06:19,325 --> 00:06:21,405
He realizes that much.

55
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:24,115
You've got to give him more credit.

56
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:34,835
O-Oh no!

57
00:06:43,425 --> 00:06:46,395
W-What was that just now?

58
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:50,015
It looked like some kind of
amazing rocket came from his hands.

59
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:02,245
Whew, that was close!

60

61
00:07:06,825 --> 00:07:10,795

I-It couldn't be...

How's that? Pretty cool, huh?

64
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:22,135
I can do that too.

65
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,765
I just barely had it taught to me though.

66
00:07:24,805 --> 00:07:28,435
Watch this! Ka-me-ka-me...

67
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:31,815
You dummy, it's <i>KameHAme-Ha.</i>

71
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,205
C-Can't be!

What the hell was that?

74
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:12,315
I-It-It looks like him. He looks just like him!

75
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:16,275
That guy that was there
during the fight with Cell.

76
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:20,155
I hit the house!

77
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:23,365
Looks like we better stop
doing <i>Kikoha</i>-like blasts.

78
00:08:23,405 --> 00:08:26,785
You're dangerous with them, Goten.

79
00:08:26,825 --> 00:08:29,825
Let's go on without them.

80
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,415
Okay.

81
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:47,805

82
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,635
Me too!

83
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:01,695
Ikose-<i>chan</i>, Idasa-<i>chan...</i>

84
00:09:01,735 --> 00:09:08,205
Mama is upset that you two
got beat up by those vulgar kids!

85
00:09:08,245 --> 00:09:10,745
But dear, those two were special.

86
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:13,335
They had incredible victories
in their later matches too.

87
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:17,335
No, we cannot lose.

88
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:22,755
At the next Tenkaichi Tournament,
you have to beat those two brats!

89
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:24,385
In order to do that, starting now,

90
00:09:24,425 --> 00:09:26,765
it's training, training, and more training!

91
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:30,265
Keep going, Idasa, Ikose.

92
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:41,235
All right, I think it's about
time I bring this to a close, Goten.

93
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:47,695
I am going to be victorious!

94
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:51,995
I'm going to win!

95
00:10:13,725 --> 00:10:18,265
Huh? Trunks-<i>kun</i> is gone!

96
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:21,685
Oh no!

97
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,795
Uh oh, Goten!

98
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:47,545
How's this, Goten? Now say you give up!

99
00:10:50,715 --> 00:10:54,685
Hey, no matter how you look at it,
they're floating in mid-air, right?

100
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,185
Yeah.

101
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:00,975
Hurry and say you give up!

102
00:11:01,015 --> 00:11:04,775
If I grab you any tighter, you'll die!

103
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:08,655
N-No way!

104
00:11:13,195 --> 00:11:16,705
It looks as though Trunks wins this one.

105
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:19,495
Goten, stick it out! Stand up to him!

106
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:30,545
I said say it, and I mean it!

107
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:51,575
He can become a Super Saiyan?!

108
00:11:51,615 --> 00:11:53,745
Oh, Goten, you fool!

109
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:56,415
That was dirty, Kakarrot!

110
00:11:56,455 --> 00:11:59,875
It's no use telling me...

111
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:23,725
That one kid, didn't he seem
somehow different just now?

112
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:27,145
I had the same feeling.

113
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:36,325
What is this, a dream? A vision?

114
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:46,705
I-It's them all right. N-No mistaking it.

115
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:51,375
It's his child, he's a dead ringer.

116
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:19,115
That's cheating, Goten!

117
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:22,785
We aren't supposed to
become Super Saiyans, you know!

118
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:28,585
Sorry, couldn't help it.
I won't do it again, for sure!

119
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,625
Well, okay then.

120
00:13:31,665 --> 00:13:33,175
Goten...

121
00:13:35,635 --> 00:13:37,215
What?

122
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:41,345
If I really wanted to,

123
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:47,685
I could win without even using my left arm.

124
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:50,945
You're kidding! You couldn't win!

125
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:52,525
Yes I could!

126
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:58,195
No you couldn't. Just try! You can't
use your left arm, no matter what!

127
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:00,445
Right, I know! Here goes!

128
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:20,175
Trunks!

129
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:23,685
Goten-<i>chan</i>, go! Go on!

130
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:42,325
How about it? Can you fix it?

131
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:48,795
It's no use.

132
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:51,545
I don't even know what
the cause of the malfunction is.

133
00:14:51,585 --> 00:14:55,085
Hey, aren't there any other TV cameras?

134
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:59,505
Even the spare camera is broken.

135
00:14:59,545 --> 00:15:03,095
The other station's cameras, as well as
the spectator's home videos and cameras,

136
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:07,645
they all seem to be ruined.
Isn't that strange?

137
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:09,645
Unbelievable, how can this be?

138
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:14,185
How is it we can't record such
an incredible fight?! Dammit!

139
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:45,675
You cheater!

140
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:11,085
H-He's flying entirely in mid-air,
that's all there is to it.

141
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:15,085
You've completely mastered
the Bukujutsu technique, huh Goten?

142
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,675
What do you suppose he's up to now?

143
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:28,515
Gohan-<i>kun</i>, you've been giving
him some kind of special training

144
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:31,105
behind my back, haven't you?

145
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:34,065
N-No, it's been about the same as always.

146
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:36,645
Really?

147
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:40,655
Well then, how did he get so...?

148
00:16:50,915 --> 00:16:53,245
Charge!

149
00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:07,885
<i>He's building up his speed as he</i>
<i>drops and plans on dashing at me...</i>

150
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:10,015
<i>...as he watches which way I go.</i>

151
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:19,395
<i>Okay, I'll just dodge him in the nick of time.</i>

152
00:17:19,435 --> 00:17:21,485
<i>He's just barely started to fly.</i>

153
00:17:21,525 --> 00:17:23,615
<i>He won't be able to follow my moves.</i>

154
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:38,915
<i>Now!</i>

155
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,625
<i>Crash!</i>

156
00:17:42,545 --> 00:17:43,635
What?!

157
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:09,905
Goten...

158
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:12,575
You dummy!

159
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:32,935
Ringout! Contestant
Trunks wins. He is the victor!

160
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:35,895
The Junior Division has a victor!

161
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:40,395
I did it! I did it!

162
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:45,105
Trunks won!

163
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:48,115
G-Goten-<i>chan...</i>

164
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:54,415
Goten and Trunks both fought well.

165
00:18:54,455 --> 00:18:56,915
I'm going to do well, too!

166
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:13,135
You mean, even Lil' Trunks
can become a Super Saiyan?

167
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:17,435
Hey, too bad.

168
00:19:17,475 --> 00:19:20,855
Looks as though my son
comes from the better stock.

169
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:21,895
Y-Yeah.

170
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:28,025
Not sure what all happened,
but that was an incredible match!

171
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,695
I've never seen anything like it!

172
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:44,295
What was that, Trunks-<i>kun</i>?!
You cheated, didn't you?!

173
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:49,045
You turned Super Saiyan,
and you used your left hand!

174
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:50,715
Cheater! Cheater!

175
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:54,805
Sorry, sorry, I couldn't help myself.
But what about you?

176
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:58,855
You turned Super Saiyan
earlier too, so we're even.

177
00:19:58,895 --> 00:20:01,815
And I didn't actually
use my left hand to hit you.

178
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:06,395
A real man wouldn't complain about it.

179
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:09,525
What's the matter?
Look, don't get all sore at me,

180
00:20:09,565 --> 00:20:13,825
and I'll give you any
three of my toys that you like.

181
00:20:13,865 --> 00:20:19,125
Really? You have to now! You promised me!

182
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,625
Okay?

183
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:22,835
"Tenkaichi Tournament"

184
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,915
And now, following such a tense match,

185
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:27,425
it's time for this delightful attraction!

186
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:30,845
We will now have Trunks-<i>kun,</i>
the winner of the Junior Division,

187
00:20:30,885 --> 00:20:36,265
fight against the World Champion, Mister Satan!

188
00:20:38,475 --> 00:20:44,015
Satan! Satan! Satan!

189
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:06,915
So, what do you suppose that guy will do now?

190
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:10,375
What if he decides to cry "trick" again?

191
00:21:12,925 --> 00:21:15,925
There's no way he can match up against Trunks.

192
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:24,105
Pay no mind, pay no mind!

193
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:47,995
Lucky you, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

194
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:16,775
<i>The children's match</i>
<i>ends with Trunks as the victor.</i>

195
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:21,785
<i>And now comes the</i>
<i>showdown against Mister Satan.</i>

196
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:30,125
W-What am I going to do?!

197
00:22:34,295 --> 00:22:38,925
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

198
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:45,475
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

199
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:56,065
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

200
00:22:56,105 --> 00:23:02,195
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

201
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:09,165
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

202
00:23:09,205 --> 00:23:14,545
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

203
00:23:15,215 --> 00:23:18,425
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

204
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:27,475
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

205
00:23:27,515 --> 00:23:29,065
<i>Even now?</i>

206
00:23:29,105 --> 00:23:36,655
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

207
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:42,075
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

208
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:48,575
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

209
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:58,585
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

210
00:24:13,775 --> 00:24:15,735
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

211
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:18,105
<i>Mister Satan sure has it rough, huh?</i>

212
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:21,365
<i>He has to fight a Super Saiyan,</i>
<i>even if he's just a child.</i>

213
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:23,615
<i>If I run, my reputation will be tarnished.</i>

214
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:26,825
<i>If I fight him, I'll be killed...</i>

215
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,915
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

216
00:24:28,955 --> 00:24:31,915
<i>"Now What, Satan!?</i>
<i>The Greatest Pinch in History"</i>

217
00:24:31,955 --> 00:24:36,585
<i>Y-You dummy, Trunks!</i>
<i>You can't hit him that hard!</i>

218
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,715
"Next time"
"Now What, Satan!?
The Greatest Pinch in History"
