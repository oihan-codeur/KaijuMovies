1
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,800
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,390
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,150
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,740
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,040
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,790
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,380
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,300
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,140
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,680
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,690
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,240
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,110
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,700
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,080
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,290
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,130
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,920
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,220
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,100
<i>Upon Trunks winning the Junior Division,</i>

24
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,900
<i>a pair of mysterious men</i>
<i>appear before the Z Warriors.</i>

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:20,040
<i>And so, the drawing for</i>
<i>the Tenkaichi Tournament began.</i>

26
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,740
Vegeta, huh?

27
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,990
Mister Satan, number 10.

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,710
It's been too long!
So, shall we get slightly rowdy?

29
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,250
Right, ladies and gentlemen!

30
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,550
We are about to commence
the Tenkaichi Tournament!

31
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:11,760
<i>"What's the Matter, Piccolo!?</i>
<i>An Unheard-of No-Fight-Forfeit."</i>

32
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,080
Mister Satan, the board with the matches for
this Tenkaichi Tournament has been drawn up.

33
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,870
Can we have your impressions at this time?

34
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, this time, from where I see it,

35
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,460
I would say that many high-level
contestants have come together.

36
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,090
I hope they will stick it out
well in the cause of advancing

37
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:48,680
and expanding the
techniques of hand-to-hand fighting,

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,510
as they take aim at such a large star as myself.

39
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,850
As might be expected of Mister Satan!

40
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,770
Always thinking about the
world of hand-to-hand, aren't you?

41
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,780
Of course, as Champion, it's only natural.

42
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,150
Champion, could you tell us your
aspirations for this Tournament?

43
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:13,200
Well, there can be only one aspiration
for someone aiming to be World Champion.

44
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,250
Can we take that to be a
declaration of victory, then?

45
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:22,250
Oh, no, you never know what
might happen during the matches.

46
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,250
Carelessness is forbidden.

47
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,260
Such modesty!

48
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,260
Moving along, does anyone
know who my opponent is?

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,850
She's a lady contestant, named No. 18.

50
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,770
Ho, a lady? No, this is too much!

51
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,320
<i>He's known all along, and I told him.</i>

52
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,210
<i>Piccolo-san...</i>

53
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,010
Say, Gohan-<i>kun</i>, that person has
been just like that for some time now.

54
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,170
He's unusually uptight, isn't he?

55
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,760
That's not it in the least.

56
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,390
He does that to heighten his <i>ki</i> is all.

57
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,850
<i>Piccolo-san, why are you so uptight?</i>
<i>Is it your next opponent?</i>

58
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,410
You're sure fired up, aren't you Goku?

59
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,250
I just can't seem to wait.

60
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,420
Considering your first match is against Vegeta,

61
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,920
it'll be like holding the final round right there.

62
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,920
I'm already excited!

63
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,310
Piccolo...

64
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,150
Yeah, he's pretty fired up too.

65
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,730
Indeed, looks like you'll be my
opponent in the second round, Piccolo.

66
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,150
Take it easy on me, okay?

67
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,240
Right, Goku?

68
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,410
And as for you, your opponent
is the World Champion for now.

69
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,380
Spare him enough face accordingly.

70
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,920
Leave it alone! I know, already.

71
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,400
Videl's in the third match?

72
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,240
For some reason, I'm starting to get excited too!

73
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,650
Not to worry.

74
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,120
Videl winning is about as sure
a thing as Mister Satan winning.

75
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,330
That's a good point.

76
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,750
Oh, The Great Saiyaman is here!

77
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:10,040
That means the second round will have
a match between the two friends of justice!

78
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,170
That'll be interesting, huh?

79
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:17,090
Hmph, I'm not even sure that yokel
boy will even get past the first round!

80
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,680
Listen up, raise your voices!

81
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,760
We, the Satan City Police will support
Videl-<i>san</i> with everything we've got!

82
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:26,310
Here!

83
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:30,150
What's up, Bulma? You're
having an unusually fun time of it.

84
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:33,530
After all, Trunks just won the Junior Division.

85
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,740
With that having sunk in, of course I'm happy.

86
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,160
Vegeta will win the Senior Division,

87
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,490
and father and son will have
won the Tenkaichi Tournament.

88
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,700
That'll be impossible!

89
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,540
His opponent is my Goku-<i>sa.</i>

90
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,800
Forget victory, Vegeta
will lose in the first round.

91
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,380
Oh, we don't know that.

92
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,720
After all, Trunks-<i>kun</i> beat out Goten-<i>kun.</i>

93
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,720
It's an absolute certainty
that Goku-<i>sa</i> will be the victor!

94
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,520
As sure as the sun comes up in
the west, Goku-<i>sa</i> does not lose!

95
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm sorry, but you know, Vegeta has
been undergoing ferocious training...

96
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,530
...with my newly-modeled
hyper-gravity device for five years now.

97
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,700
This time Vegeta will win for sure!

98
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,580
Goku-<i>sa</i> knows our family's
livin' rests on him winnin'!

99
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,160
Not like some people I could mention
who are here to fight as their hobby!

100
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,750
Vegeta will win!

101
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,920
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

102
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,170
Vegeta!

103
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,500
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

104
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,970
H-Hey! Cut it out, you're
both acting like children!

105
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,760
You shut up!

106
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,970
Ooh, ow!

107
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,390
We apologize for the delay.

108
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,480
Who from among this group will
it be that stands at the pinnacle?

109
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,480
And so, we commence the matches!

110
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,650
First up is Contestant
Kuririn vs. Contestant Punter.

111
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,070
Good luck, Kuririn.

112
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,990
Well, guess I'll be back in a moment.

113
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,960
Whaddya think you're...

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,540
Oh, so that's where you were!

115
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:18,040
I thought maybe you'd run away again!

116
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,930
You've gotta have no luck
to be my opponent right away!

117
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,470
Well, don't worry yourself.

118
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,350
With any luck, you'll just
have to be taken to the hospital.

119
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,520
And so, the two contestants take the ring.

120
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,530
Contestant Kuririn placed very well in
this Tournament during his younger years,

121
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,530
and this will be his first
appearance in a long while.

122
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,950
He faces Contestant Punter,
known for his ferocity,

123
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,540
who last Tournament made
it all the way to the semifinals,

124
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,500
where he unfortunately
met with a loss by ringout.

125
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,580
This Tournament, he naturally
came with his eye on victory!

126
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:12,520
That man fighting with Father
looks big and strong. Is he okay?

127
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,730
Relax, relax. That guy is nothing at all.

128
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,440
Your father is the strongest man in the world!

129
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
Really?

130
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,230
Yeah, really.

131
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,530
Among earthlings, anyhow.

132
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,490
What's the deal with
that difference in body size?

133
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,120
This is no excuse for a match!

134
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,950
That poor Contestant Kuririn!

135
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,610
Oh, Contestant Punter!

136
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,700
Even with that much difference in their size,

137
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,490
he doesn't appear to be
going easy on him one bit!

138
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,780
Contestant Punter is here with a purpose!

139
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,750
So, how will Contestant
Kuririn face off against him?

140
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,750
It's obvious! I'll have to make him understand

141
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,670
that the Tenkaichi Tournament
is no place to play around.

142
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,760
It's no place for a pipsqueak
pappy like yourself to come to.

143
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,590
<i>Man, this is no time to be wasting</i>
<i>my energy on a bonehead like him.</i>

144
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,780
Once you set flame to Punter's
brutal way of fighting, he has no mercy.

145
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,630
And so, please begin the match immediately!

146
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,990
As you can see, I may be large,

147
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,580
but I'm also fast and nimble. Got that?!

148
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,750
You know that it's useless for
you to try to scamper away from me!

149
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,830
I got it, I got it. I won't run, I won't run.

150
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,760
It's too soon to lose heart yet!

151
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,510
I'll show you how tough I am next!
Go ahead and try punching me.

152
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:58,100
What's the matter? Don't be shy!

153
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,520
Well? Well? Well?

154
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,520
All right.

155
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,820
I accept your...

156
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,820
...gracious offer!

157
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,710
Right, Ringout!

158
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:33,180
Contestant Punter, Ringout!
Contestant Kuririn wins!

159
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,720
Awesome!

160
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,720
–He did it, he did it!
–He did it, he did it!

161
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,560
Father is strong!

162
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,150
Told ya.

163
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,520
<i>Way to go! As good as ever!</i>

164
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,110
<i>I've been waiting for this!</i>

165
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,490
<i>The Tenkaichi Tournament</i>
<i>has got to be just like this!</i>

166
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,490
Nice going, Kuririn.

167
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,490
No problem.

168
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:00,790
Piccolo, your turn is next. Good luck!

169
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,920
Hey, what are you so nervous about?

170
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,510
This isn't the kind of match you
should be getting nervous over!

171
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,970
What's up, you guys?

172
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,520
No fair, Trunks-<i>kun.</i>
Let me have some too!

173
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,480
No way, we'll be found out! After the match!

174
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,480
But it's hot in here, I can't stand it!

175
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,820
Ah, watch out! You can't
just let go! Here, have some.

176
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,750
Ah, that was good.

177
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,000
Continuing to the second match,

178
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,880
we will have Contestant
Shin vs. Contestant Ma Junior.

179
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,300
Both contestants, will enter the ring.

180
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,980
I see now. This would appear to
be quite an entertaining tournament.

181
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,910
And so, both contestants, if you would...

182
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,330
This is Contestant Shin's
first Tournament appearance.

183
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,080
He faces Contestant Ma Junior,

184
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,500
who showed us an extraordinary final
round battle in a Tournament long ago,

185
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,840
one that I remember quite well!

186
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,930
Uh, er, please don't
destroy the stadium this time.

187
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,930
Hey, isn't that one of the
guys that got in the way

188
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:44,930
when Mister Satan fought Cell?

189
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,600
You're right! Unmistakable, it was on the TV!

190
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,030
What's the matter?

191
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,870
Does he really bother you
that much? This Shin character?

192
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,870
Yeah, guess so.

193
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't know... He doesn't look all that great.

194
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,470
<i>Finally, we'll find out exactly the</i>
<i>extent of this guy's battle power,</i>

195
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,350
<i>which so far we can't even guess at.</i>

196
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:32,520
And so, our second match! Please begin!

197
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,410
<i>My power is failing me...</i>

198
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,010
<i>W-Why? For some reason,</i>
<i>it's difficult to fight him...</i>

199
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,220
<i>Yet I've just met him.</i>

200
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,860
What's wrong?! Why aren't they fighting?!

201
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,110
What's happening?

202
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,870
What's the matter? Please begin!

203
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,040
Stop messing around and go, already!

204
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:39,170
We came here to watch a match!
We didn't come to see some staring contest!

205
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:46,390
Time is running out! Please, hurry and start!

206
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,200
<i>U-Unbelievable!</i>

207
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,830
What's the matter with you, Piccolo-<i>san</i>?

208
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,700
<i>That rotten...</i>

209
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,140
<i>J-Just who is this guy? What is it about him?</i>

210
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,350
You will know soon enough.

211
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,310
You will know soon enough.

212
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,950
But now, let's just enjoy the game.

213
00:18:57,830 --> 00:18:59,670
<i>Piccolo!</i>

214
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,380
What is the matter?

215
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,300
E-Excuse me.

216
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,810
I withdraw.

217
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,230
W-Withdraw?!

218
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,230
By withdraw, you mean you aren't fighting?

219
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,060
That's correct.

220
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,240
<i>That's right, he used to be</i>
<i>the Kami over this planet.</i>

221
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,830
<i>Perhaps he has already</i>
<i>begun to sense who it is I am.</i>

222
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:39,210
Since Contestant Ma Junior has withdrawn,
Contestant Shin wins without a fight!

223
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,260
What was that?
What's going on?! Doesn't he feel well?

224
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,890
You're right, he does seem awfully pale.

225
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,260
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

226
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,850
Hey, Piccolo...

227
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,770
That bad, Piccolo?

228
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,190
Yeah. Our dimensions are too different.

229
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,820
You're kidding, right? Stop joking around!

230
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,110
I have to fight against him next!

231
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,460
Well, let's keep on going.
Next is the third match.

232
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,120
Contestant Videl vs. Contestant Spopovitch.

233
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:33,010
Videl! Videl! Videl! Videl!

234
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,810
You're incredibly popular, huh?

235
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,680
G-Good luck, Videl-<i>san</i>!

236
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,440
Hey, Spopovitch! It's your turn!

237
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,820
Hey, you hear me?

238
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,300
It's time.

239
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,940
Gohan-<i>kun...</i>

240
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,940
I'll be waiting for you in the second round.

241
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:35,200
Contestant Videl is, as everyone
knows, Mister Satan's daughter,

242
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,450
as well as a friend of justice,
who in cooperation with the police,

243
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,540
has helped punish many bad people.

244
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,380
At the Tournament seven
years ago, despite being a little girl,

245
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,630
she prides herself on
winning the Junior Division.

246
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,220
She faces Contestant Spopovitch,

247
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,380
who was eliminated in the
first round of the last Tournament,

248
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,350
but having undergone an Image
Change, is up to the challenge again.

249
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:04,310
Videl! Videl! Videl!

250
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,820
<i>The Tenkaichi Tournament</i>
<i>reaches high tide with the appearance</i>

251

<i>of the ultra-popular Videl.</i>

252
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,960
<i>However, there is a mysterious contestant,</i>
<i>against whom even Piccolo is powerless.</i>

253
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,630
<i>What is the nature of this Shin?</i>

254
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:28,960
<i>And what is the meaning behind his gaze?</i>

255
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,890
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

256

257
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:56,030
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

258
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,120
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

259
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,130
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

260
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,510
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

261
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,390
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

262
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:27,440
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

263
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,980
<i>Even now?</i>

264
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:36,610
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

265
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,030
<i>There's some mysterious</i>

<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>

<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

269
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,910
<i>Hey, Gohan, there's something</i>
<i>weird about that Spopovitch guy.</i>

270
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,700
<i>You should get Videl to withdraw.</i>

271
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,540
<i>Eh?! His neck is broken,</i>
