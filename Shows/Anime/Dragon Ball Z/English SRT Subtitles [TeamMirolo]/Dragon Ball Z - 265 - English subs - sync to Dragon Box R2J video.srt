<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,090
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:48,980
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,730
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,320

<i>After a ferocious battle with Gohan,</i>
<i>Majin Boo went and blew his own body up!</i>

24
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,540
How good of you to have gotten away, Dende!

25
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,080
<i>However, shortly after</i>
<i>reuniting with Dende and Satan,</i>

26
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,920
<i>Boo once again came attacking.</i>

27
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:57,100
Hey, pipsqueaks! Come
on out! I want to fight you!

28
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,570
You've got it backward, Boo!
I'm your opponent now!

29
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,240
What's the matter, pipsqueaks?
Are you afraid to fight me?

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,760
<i>"Boo's Worst Foul!!</i>
<i>Gotenks is Absorbed!?"</i>

31
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,460
What happened to all those
high spirits you showed earlier?

32
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,960
–What was that?
–You say we're afraid?!

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,420
You don't get it at all, do you?!

34
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:10,090
If we hadn't returned to normal earlier,
we would have completely won that fight!

35
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,890
I don't know about that.

36
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,560
You seemed to be pretty scared,
if that was supposed to be the case.

37
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,390
What was that?!

38
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,100
He said we were scared!

39
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,400
All right! What a fool! Let's get him!

40
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,820
This time, we'll get him for sure, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

41
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,490
Of course we will!

42
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,570
Are we going stand here quietly
while being mocked by that punk?

43
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,240
W-Wait! There's something odd
about this. Don't you think it's strange?

44
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,960
Why...?

45
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,830
You think too much, Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

46
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,960
What kind of strategy could
come from an idiot like that?

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,550
Yeah!

48
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,920
H-Hey!

49
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,470
All right! Plenty of time has
gone by! We can do our Fusion!

50
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,600
Don't! You guys just be quiet and
watch on. I am going to defeat him.

51
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,370
You've got to be joking!

52
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,870
We can't just sit quietly after
having been defied that badly!

53
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,060
Big Brother, you just don't know how
strong we are when we go through Fusion!

54
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,430
We'll show you right now...

55
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,560
...so just give us some room!

56
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,150
<i>That's right! Do it now!</i>
<i>That Fusion or whatever thing!</i>

57
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,530
All right, let's go, Goten!

58
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,320
Yeah!

59
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,330
This time, let's start out
right away as Super Gotenks!

60
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,950
–Fu–
–Fu–

61
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,250
–sion Ha!!

62
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,720
Oh, so this is Fusion?

63
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,480
Yea!

64
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,400
Dum-dum-dum-dum! It's the
Grim Reaper of Justice, Super Gotenks!

65
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,570
I-Incredible...

66
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:41,580
For two people to become
one person... th-that can't be so!

67
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,960
<i>All right!</i>

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,920
<i>If I can just add those pipsqueaks'</i>
<i>power and that Piccolo guy's brains...</i>

69
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,700
I-Is this not a trick?

70
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,790
W-What is it, at a time
like this? Are you hungry?

71
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,290
Tough it out, I'm starving myself.

72
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:44,100
<i>A-one, two, three, four...</i>
<i>A-one, two, three, four...</i>

73
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:51,940
Well, how about I give it to him now?
After all, I'm the one he designated.

74
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,580
But even so... it will be no
trouble at all putting him away!

75
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,370
Very well. But don't drop your guard!

76
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,620
Awright!

77
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,450
Y-You dummy! Where
are you going? Come back!

78
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,580
W-Wait up! Where are you going?!

79
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,500
Wait!

80
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,680
Here goes!

81
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,270
W-What?!

82
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,700
W-What is this?!

83
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,960
P-Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

84
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,930
W-Why, you! What have you done?!

85
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,690
You're mine!

86
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,370
D-Dammit, no!

87
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,300
A-Ah, hell! So that's what he was doing?

88
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,090
G-Get him, Gohan! Get him now!

89
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,440
Does that mean...?

90
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,490
W-W-What was that?! What's happened?!

91
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:29,490
P-Piccolo-<i>san</i> and Super
Gotenks were absorbed by Boo!

92
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:33,500
C-Can he do something like that?

93
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,410
What do you think, Gohan-<i>kun</i>?

94
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,460
My strategy succeeded without incident.
Now, look! Wonderful, isn't it?

95
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:54,390
This is that moment which will
never come again, no matter the future...

96
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,350
the birth of the mightiest of Majin!

97
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,600
That was dirty, you! How could
you pull those two into yourself?!

98
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,180
It's your fault! You're the
one who was stronger than me,

99
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,770
who should have been the absolute strongest!

100
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:46,530
From the time I could feel your
existence so far away, I began this strategy.

101
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,530
Perhaps there was
someone even stronger than I.

102
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,910
And so I thought

103
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:55,410
that if I were to absorb the Super
Gotenks or whoever the runts were

104
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,370
I was fighting with at the time into myself,

105
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,000
then no matter what matter
of fellow might show up,

106
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,750
my throne as the mightiest
of all would not be shaken.

107
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:07,130
However, it seemed that those
runts' power was limited by time.

108
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,550
That's what they said.

109
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,640
Get on with it!

110
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,770
I can only stay this ridiculously
strong for a little while longer, after all!

111
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,650
It will take another hour
before I can become like this again!

112
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,070
It wouldn't do for me to have them return
back to normal at the moment I absorbed them.

113
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,780
I waited for the next opportunity.

114
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,040
It was apparent that given an hour, they
could once again turn into this Super Gotenks.

115
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,250
As such, I disappeared for that long.

116
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,750
So that was it, was it?

117
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,130
However, for you to be standing
there babbling on like that,

118
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,680
your slow-wittedness doesn't
seem to have changed at all.

119
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,680
As long as you were out absorbing people,
wanting to make yourself first-rate material,

120
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,560
it would have been a lot
easier to have just absorbed me!

121
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,400
You don't seem to understand at all, do you?

122
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,770
Without an opponent, what am I
to do once I become the strongest?

123
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,190
What?

124
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,780
The previous Majin Boo said he was
definitely going to blow you away, right?

125
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,780
That is my greatest goal.

126
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,620
I see, so that's it. You've convinced me.

127
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,210
Now, then...

128
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,790
You'll have to allow me
to hurry through this fight.

129
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,590
Apparently this Super
Gotenks that I've absorbed

130
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,180
has quite a short
transformation time limit about him.

131
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,680
That's a fairly level-headed
determination, coming from you.

132
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,350
Looks like you were right
to absorb Piccolo-<i>san</i> as well.

133
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,800
I'm going to kill you. That's for sure.

134
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,600
Before you do... I'll kill you!

135
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,230
U-Um... Green-faced Kami-<i>sama</i>?

136
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,190
C-Could you see that just now?

137
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,610
Just now? You mean the fight just now?

138
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,950
Then they were fighting? For you
to be able to see movement that fast,

139
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,790
you really are Kami-<i>sama</i>, aren't you?

140
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,790
Y-Yes. I am being allowed to
serve as such for the time being.

141
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,960
I-I apologize for not saying so before,

142
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,090
but I am the world champion
of combat sports, Mister Satan.

143
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,760
Pleased to meet you.

144
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,630
Ah, it is I who am pleased to meet you.

145
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,190
Hmph. It appears you still aren't
putting out enough power to kill me.

146
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:04,110
Perhaps you first wish to test my abilities?

147
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,740
That's what I would expect
from this being Piccolo-<i>san.</i>

148
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,290
You've seen right through me, then?
This is going to be hard.

149
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,090
In that case, it's about
time I got down to business!

150
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,590
Come on!

151
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,240
So, what comes next?

152
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,730
Gohan-<i>san</i>! Behind you!

153
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,540
Gohan, tough it out!

154
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:46,420
Honorable ancestor! Can Gohan-<i>san</i>
really win against Boo? What do you think?

155
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:52,010
I don't know.

156
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,510
H-How irresponsible!

157
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,540
G-Gohan-san's <i>ki</i> has
disappeared! Th-That can't be!

158
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,250
Have you been beaten, Gohan?

159
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,880
This is pretty bad, huh?

160
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,450
What's the matter? Are you trying
to buy time by hiding yourself there,

161
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,820
while you hold your <i>ki</i>?

162
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:05,960
Which would mean that
you've realized at least this much–

163
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,960
that there's no way you
can stand up to me like this!

164
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,180
<i>Having obtained Piccolo's</i>
<i>brains and Super Gotenks' power,</i>

165
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,180
<i>Majin Boo has been reborn!</i>

166
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,970
<i>What will become of Gohan's fight</i>
<i>against this strongest, most evil of enemies?</i>

167
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,270
We'll see!

168
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:38,620
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

169
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,160
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

170
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:55,760
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

171
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,850
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

172
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:08,860
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

173
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:14,240
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

174
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,120
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

175
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:27,170
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

176
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,710
<i>Even now?</i>

177
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:36,340
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

178
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,760
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

179
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,230
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

180
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:58,280
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

181
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:15,340
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

182
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,720
<i>Damn it, even as powered-up</i>
<i>as Gohan has become,</i>

183
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,970
<i>it's still a one-sided beatdown!</i>
<i>Can't something be done?!</i>

184
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,520
<i>I had not taken this into account.</i>

185
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,100
<i>Okay then, Goku, you go and help him!</i>

186
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,270
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

187
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,030
<i>"For the Sake Of the Entire Universe...</i>
<i>Return to Life, Son Goku."</i>

188
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:37,900
<i>Father can come back to life,</i>
<i>using the Grand Kaioshin's life.</i>

189
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,400
"Next time"
"For the Sake Of the Entire Universe...
Return to Life, Son Goku"
