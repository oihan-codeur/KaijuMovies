<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,820
W-What in the world was that?!

17
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,660
Bulma<i>-san</i>, I'm taking the Dragon Ball with me.

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,990
Hurry! This way now!

19
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,330
Hey, what exactly is going on?!

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,800
Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,470
Hold on!

22
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,100
For crying out loud!

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,270
Really, what do they think they're–

24
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,070
W-Wasn't that Vegeta with them just now?

25
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,410
<i>In the face of an enormous foe,</i>

26
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,250
<i>Kuririn and the others have temporarily</i>
<i>joined forces with Vegeta. However...</i>

27
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,890
ReaCoom!

28
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,190
Butta!

29
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,090
Jheese!

30
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,120
Ghurd!

31
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,500
Ginyu!

32
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,530
To-geth-er we are...

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,600
The Ginyu Special Corps!

34
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,550
<i>"Goku on Final Approach!</i>
<i>Smash Through Freeza's Dragnet."</i>

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,240
Well done, everyone.
I have been expecting you.

36
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,980
Thank you very much, Freeza<i>-sama.</i>
Please tell us what our mission is this time.

37
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:54,050
The traitor Vegeta has taken the
Dragon Balls that I had gathered, and fled.

38
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,390
Vegeta...

39
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,390
Hey, that's that Saiyan, right?

40
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,830
I hear he's quite the arrogant bastard, for
someone who doesn't have that much power.

41
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,770
Vegeta has betrayed Freeza<i>-sama...</i>

42
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,270
However, for whatever reason, his battle
power is starting to rise higher and higher.

43
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:24,780
Although, he should still be no match for you.

44
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,120
Please rough him up so as not to
kill him, and bring him back here.

45
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,460
I would like to force him to tell me
where he has hidden the Dragon Balls.

46
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,430
That will be a simple task.
Our Scouters are already tracking Vegeta.

47
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,140
He appears to be traveling at
high speed not too far from here.

48
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,340
What is the matter?

49
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,440
Who might these other
two who are with him be?

50
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,480
They appear to have a fairly high battle power.

51
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,790
Two of them? Ah, those must be
the two children who interfered earlier.

52
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,790
So they <i>have</i> teamed up
with each other, have they?

53
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,320
What are we to do with them?

54
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,130
You are to kill them.

55
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,510
–Lucky!
–Hooray! Hooray!

56
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,610
Understood. Let us go
thoroughly enjoy ourselves.

57
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,340
At the heart of it all,

58
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,280
you are no more than just a Saiyan
monkey, kneeling under our rule.

59
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,350
Don't go thinking you're
on an equal level with us,

60
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:08,380
just because Freeza<i>-sama</i>
has taken a liking to you!

61
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,860
As perfect as Freeza<i>-sama</i>
might be in everything else,

62
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,100
there's still one thing that I can't comprehend.

63
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,770
And that's how someone as useless as you are

64
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,100
has been admitted into the Ginyu Special Corps.

65
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,940
What?! Try saying that again!

66
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,420
Don't breathe next to me.
It stinks so bad, I can't stand it.

67
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,980
I'll show you whether or not I'm useless!

68
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,090
This is no time to be playing around...

69
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,290
...Vegeta<i>-san.</i>

70
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,970
A very nice planet has been found.
It should sell at a high price.

71
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,740
Let us go see it–just the two of us.

72
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,940
As you wish.

73
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:15,780
Looks like you got away with
your life. You're a lucky one, at least.

74
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,700
That miserable Vegeta...

75
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,700
Oh my, what's the matter,
Ghurd? Do you have to go potty?

76
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,400
No, it's nothing.

77
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,110
Freeza<i>-sama</i>, the Scouters
you ordered are in this case.

78
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,380
Well done.

79
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,490
Well then, we will be off.

80
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,430
Special Corps!

81
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,920
Ginyu! Fight!

82
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,130
<i>They've started moving.</i>

83
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,450
T-They're fast! Hurry!
They're going to overtake us!

84
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,750
<i>These strong guys are coming</i>
<i>at us, one after the next...</i>

85
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,560
<i>There's nothing we can do! Father!</i>

86
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,430
20 minutes to arrival at Planet Namek.
20 minutes to arrival at Planet Namek.

87
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,650
All right...

88
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,490
Oh yeah...

89
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,070
Kaio<i>-sama</i> didn't have
to send me so many of them.

90
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,780
Someone even more
incredible than Vegeta, huh?

91
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,310
Stay alive, everyone.

92
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,190
Ten more minutes...

93
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,830
It's funny. I don't feel any fear.
What am I so relaxed for?

94
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,680
There's going to be someone
unbelievable out there...

95
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,350
...and yet, nothing.

96
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,120
Maybe training in all that
outrageous gravity has made me crazy.

97
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,540
Over there!

98
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:28,540
We've got them all!

99
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,710
Come on!

100
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,110
What's the matter?! Get over here, now!

101
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,720
Why, you!

102
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,020
Gohan, no matter how
I think this through, it's not right.

103
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,090
How can we let this guy have eternal life?

104
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,760
Don't give me that now!

105
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,630
Hurry up and turn over your Ball!

106
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,330
We don't have time to dawdle!

107
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:08,110
Yo, Veggie<i>-chan.</i>

108
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:09,750
It's been a long time, huh?

109
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,340
Dammit! And I was so close!

110
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:40,510
They're fast! They were so fast,
I didn't even know they were approaching!

111
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,520
By any chance, is that one
of those Dragon Ball things?

112
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,730
There are five of them lying over here.

113
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,790
This is all because you were so slow!

114
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,230
H-How can you say that?

115
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,730
Freeza<i>-sama</i> will be overjoyed by this.

116
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,140
You have to get all seven
Dragon Balls together, right?

117
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,470
There are five of them behind us,
and you've got two of them.

118
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,510
That's all of them, isn't it?

119
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,790
<i>W-What Vegeta said was true.</i>
<i>I'm no match for them!</i>

120
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,360
<i>And that guy is exceptionally</i>
<i>amazing, even among these guys.</i>

121
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,800
Y-You think we're going
to just hand them over to you?!

122
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,780
You seem to have it all wrong.

123
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,010
Without Freeza<i>-sama</i>'s power,
you can't do anything!

124
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,450
Watch what you're saying!

125
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,780
What?!

126
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,750
Come on! Come on!

127
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,790
<i>That guy... that guy alone</i>
<i>is really not all that tough.</i>

128
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,420
<i>W-Why is that guy mixed in with them?</i>

129
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,170
Stay back! You smell so bad, I can't take it.

130
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,500
–Die!!
–Whoa!

131
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,480
Don't go acting on your own, Ghurd.

132
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,180
It's not like we've decided
that he's your prey yet.

133
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,060
Why don't you hand that
over right now, Vegeta?

134
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,590
Although, even if you do hand it over quietly,

135
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,120
we have no intention of
turning a blind eye to you.

136
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,070
You guys may be able to search
for people with your Scouters,

137
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:16,130
but I doubt you can search for these.

138
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,470
What of it?

139
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,970
This is what!

140
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,690
I'm back.

141
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,180
That's too bad. It looked like
you were trying to throw it far away.

142
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:32,120
Unfortunately for you, Butta's
speed is the fastest in the universe.

143
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,350
T-That's impossible!

144
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,260
Now then, the other one...

145
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,130
Destroy it!

146
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,530
Damn it all!

147
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:59,040
The Dragon Ball...

148
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,620
H-How?

149
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,220
So the rumors were true, were they?

150
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,660
What do you mean, rumors?

151
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,690
They say that Ghurd is
able to control and stop time,

152
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,660
momentary though it may be.

153
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,760
T-That can't be true...

154
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,970
It's true, all right.

155
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,310
Well then, that makes all of them.

156
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,880
Now, for your turn. We're going to
give you plenty of tender loving care.

157
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,450
And when he says tender loving care,

158
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,220
he doesn't mean patting your head,
and tossing you up in the air.

159
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,620
He means we're going to hurt you.

160
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,590
You don't have to explain that!

161
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,960
Vegeta, is fighting them
the only thing we can do?

162
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,090
You must have realized
running away would be futile.

163
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,030
Having you guys around is better than nothing.

164
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,570
Even knowing the extent of your power

165
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,600
you showed me on Earth will be
useless, I'll still be counting on it.

166
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,740
I'll take Vegeta.

167
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,910
You guys decide who gets the other two

168
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,410
unknown pipsqueaks by rock-paper-scissors.

169
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,580
–Why do you always do this?
–That's not fair!

170
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,450
–You can't do that, Commander Ginyu!
–Yeah!

171
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,750
You took the tastiest piece
last time, too, didn't you?!

172
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,290
You can't do that!

173
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:28,060
Let me have him! I owe him one!

174
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,130
I guess I've got no choice.

175
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,770
All right then, I'll take the
Dragon Balls to Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

176
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,270
You guys take care of the rest on your own.

177
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,770
Hooray!

178
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:41,040
I'm nice to you, aren't I?

179
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,780
Yeah, you're the best!

180
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:47,110
Well, first will be Vegeta,

181
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,980
second will be...

182
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:54,320
Those guys are a set.

183
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,600
All right, let's go!

184
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,400
Rock, paper, scissors!

185
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,060
Tie, go again!... Tie, go again!...

186
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,770
Couldn't we get away now?

187
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,420
Hooray! I get Vegeta!

188
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,760
D-Damn it!

189
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,760
Cheer up. It's better than
him not getting killed at all.

190
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Understand, that's how it goes.
But I'll let you strike the finishing blow.

191
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,410
Now Freeza<i>-sama</i> will be
able to gain youth immortal.

192
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,010
I won't let you have them!

193
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,050
Stop! Don't waste your energy!

194
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,290
Right now, concentrate
only on defeating <i>these</i> guys,

195
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,920
instead of worrying about him, you idiot!

196
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,890
Hey, come here a minute.

197
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,840
Oh, oh, a strategy meeting, huh?

198
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,370
That Ghurd guy that you'll be
fighting has a low battle power,

199
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,410
but he uses supernatural abilities.

200
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:25,810
Don't let your guard down.

201
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,980
Yeah.

202
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,080
By the way, is Kakarrot
really not here on this planet?

203
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,650
No, he's not. But he is headed here.

204
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,760
Hurry and get here!
He may be an infuriating bastard,

205
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,430
but if we can get another ally, it will
add some to our potential for battle.

206
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,400
<i>Why in the world did we even</i>
<i>come here to this faraway place?</i>

207
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,670
<i>Far from being able to get</i>
<i>the Dragon Balls together,</i>

208
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,770
<i>we're instead letting the bad</i>
<i>guys get eternal life! Darn it!</i>

209
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,430
Huh? This is disappointing, huh?
Ghurd, you go first.

210
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,770
Tch... What am I, some kind
of battlefield garbage-collector?

211
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,330
What can I do? But ReaCoom,
make sure you really save some for me!

212
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:29,500
They're the same ludicrous bunch as ever!

213
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,480
Gohan, remember the image
training we did on the spaceship.

214
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,320
This looks like it's
going to be over in no time.

215
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,650
All right, let's go!

216
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,830
Release your <i>ki</i>!

217
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,680
What's this?

218
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,820
<i>A full-power leadoff attack...</i>

219
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:19,960
<i>A fierce, all-out battle, the likes of which</i>
<i>had not been seen before, had begun at last.</i>

220
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,690
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

221
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,530
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

222
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

223
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

224
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,910
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

225
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,010
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

226
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,520
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

227
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

228
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,660
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

229
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,760
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

230
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,570
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

231
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,600
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

232
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,280
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

233
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,450
<i>So sorry.</i>

234
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,580
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

235
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:00,590
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

236
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,310
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

237
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,840
<i>This is a surprise. Time-stopping</i>
<i>and paralyzing techniques?</i>

238
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,980
<i>Even Kuririn and Gohan</i>
<i>are at risk against those.</i>

239
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,610
<i>It's just not my lucky day,</i>
<i>having to go against these kids.</i>

240
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,420
<i>I have to beat them quick,</i>
<i>or ReaCoom will take Vegeta for himself!</i>

241
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,520
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

242
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,390
<i>"Super-Magic or Just a Trick!?</i>
<i>Mr. Ghurd is Angry!"</i>

243
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:35,430
<i>Father! Hurry! Hurry!</i>

244
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,270
"Next time"
"Super-Magic or Just a Trick!?
Mr. Ghurd is Angry!"
