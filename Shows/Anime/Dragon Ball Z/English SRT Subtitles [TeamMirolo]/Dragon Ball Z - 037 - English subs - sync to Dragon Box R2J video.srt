<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,710
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:36,420
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:43,030
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:51,900
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,400
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:04,410
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,880
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,960
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,390
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:26,300

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:36,780
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,690
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,940
<i>Wait... Let him go... Please...</i>
<i>let me have another chance to fight him!</i>

17
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,840
<i>Following a fierce battle, Goku</i>
<i>and the others had saved the earth.</i>

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,180
<i>However, there was no telling</i>
<i>when Vegeta would come to attack again.</i>

19
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,120
<i>Meanwhile, as for Bulma and company...</i>

20
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,990
If we go to Planet Namek, we
might be able to obtain their Dragon Balls.

21
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,200
Once we do that, we could
also bring everyone back to life!

22
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,530
You're naïve! You're absolutely naïve!

23
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:34,370
I calculated how much time it
would take you to reach Planet Namek.

24
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,780
It would take 4,339 years and three months.
You'd have to live to a ripe old age, huh?

25
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,280
If that's the problem, we'll be all right.

26
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,750
We're sure to make it if we
use that Saiyan's spaceship.

27
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,290
Yay! Hope is in sight!

28
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,090
<i>But whether or not it will work out that well...</i>

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,800
<i>"Mysterious Yunzabit!</i>
<i>The Search for Kami-sama's Spaceship."</i>

30
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,770
Yow!

31
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,840
"Science"

32
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,950
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, you're goin' to catch up
with everythin' that you've fallen behind on.

33
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,960
Anything but that!

34
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,830
What's the matter, Kuririn? You're trembling.

35
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,800
I-It's nothing.

36
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,740
Oww!

37
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,140
All we're doing is changing his
bandages. What a loud patient this is.

38
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,350
On second thought, I shouldn't be here.
We have to find that Saiyan spaceship quickly.

39
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,160
Let Bulma handle that. You need to
hurry and recover from your injuries.

40
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,330
B-But...

41
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,400
We never know when that
Saiyan is going to attack again.

42
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,370
You need to completely
recover before that happens.

43
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,800
Gohan<i>-chan</i> is not havin'
anythin' to do with that anymore!

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,740
I'm not lettin' him get into any more
dangerous situations like that again!

45
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,640
Next, please.

46
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,140
M-My injuries aren't all that serious, so...

47
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,740
Neither are mine!

48
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,750
Now, look here!

49
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,090
You've got to get treated properly,
or you're not goin' to get any better!

50
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,820
Come on, Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

51
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,960
No, anything but this!

52
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,900
Wow, we're lucky.

53
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,500
They said that after Gohan and I spend
three days in the hospital, we'll be fine.

54
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:25,170
You've got me beat. They said it would
be four months before my injuries heal.

55
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,080
They also said I might
not be back to my former self.

56
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:35,780
Hey, not to worry. In another month,
I'll have some new senzu beans.

57
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,190
You know, you look
just like a mummy in there.

58
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,790
Tch! I went through all that nastiness,
and they ain't even gonna keep me here.

59
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,400
You're just after the
hospital's food, aren't you?

60
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,070
When Yajirobe thought he was
going to be done in by that Saiyan,

61
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:57,110
he was like, "Sorry 'bout that! I got
lotsa respect for ya! Lemme be your friend!"

62
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,110
Why, you! What're ya talkin' 'bout?!

63
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,950
I was just sayin' that to get him off his guard!

64
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:08,150
Well, in any case, you all really done well!

65
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,590
Nothin' could make me happier. And
everyone who's dead is comin' back to life, too.

66
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,590
Mm-hmm, that is, if we can get to Planet Namek.

67
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,600
It will be all right, that's for sure!

68
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,540
Hey, everyone! The TV! Watch the TV!

69
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,340
Oh, it's you, Bulma! I thought
you were some weird nurse.

70
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,350
Shut up, would you? Here, watch the TV.

71
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,350
According to those who found it, this object,

72
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:42,150
which was discovered in
the devastation of Metro East,

73
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,160
appears to be a vehicle that came from
space, though that cannot be determined.

74
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,690
That's the Saiyan's!

75
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,690
It sure is!

76
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,490
I-I can't see!

77
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,130
Apparently, when this object
was found, there were two of them,

78
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,700
but soon after, one of them
suddenly flew away from the scene.

79
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,470
This is bad. Those scientists
have already carried it away.

80
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,370
W-What do we do?

81
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,940
This should be interesting.

82
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,350
Let's use the remote control that
Kuririn brought back, and call it here!

83
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,120
That will surprise them, I'm sure.

84
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,550
Are you sure that's going to work?

85
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:21,790
What are you talking about? I'm a genius!
I thoroughly checked it out last night.

86
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,090
Watch this.

87
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,370
It's nice that we can watch it right
here on TV, huh? Okay, beep, beep, beep...

88
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,930
Ready? It's going to start moving...

89
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,110
I want to see, too!

90
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,890
<i>W-What in the world could have happened here?!</i>

91
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,690
<i>T-The object suddenly exploded! What happened?</i>

92
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,730
<i>There is wreckage from the object all over!</i>

93
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,730
It can't be!

94
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,280
W-Why? Could that have
been the self-destruct switch?

95
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,450
What do we do?! Without that
spaceship, we can't go to Planet Namek!

96
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,720
Our last hope...

97
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,850
Completely wiped out.

98
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,450
I-It's hopeless now...

99
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,930
This <i>is</i> a problem. I probably
couldn't get there using <i>Kinto Un</i>, either.

100
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,610
This is your fault for
picking up strange remote controls!

101
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,620
Bulma<i>-san</i>, you're the one who
was hasty to push those switches.

102
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,050
Well...

103
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,250
Hey.

104
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,790
Mister Popo!

105
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,030
Hey there.

106
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,970
W-What the...?!

107
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,900
Someone come with me. There is spaceship.

108
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,080
A-A spaceship? You really have one, Popo<i>-san</i>?

109
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,950
Probably.

110
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,810
–W-Who is that?
–Mister Popo.

111
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,820
Mister Popo?

112
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,850
He stays at Kami<i>-sama</i>'s place.

113
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,690
But he's been there at Kami's palace

114
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,720
since long before this
current Kami<i>-sama</i> was ever there.

115
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,700
Say, what do you mean, "probably"?

116
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,140
Probably, it is...

117
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,640
...spaceship. But Mister Popo not know for sure.

118
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,810
Someone come with me to
check. Mister Popo show way.

119
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,080
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

120
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,880
–Me?!
–Well, Bulma<i>-san,</i>

121
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,320
nobody else would know if it's a spaceship.

122
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,930
Bulma<i>-san</i>?

123
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,950
Would I be all right? I mean, doesn't
that man have a dangerous look in his eye?

124
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,910
–What is that?!
–There's someone riding it!
–What is it?!

125
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:48,300
Bulma, what's taking you
so long? Hurry and hop on!

126
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,160
Oh, no! Save me!

127
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,230
I'm falling down!

128
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,130
I'm done for! I'm going to die!

129
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,220
We're counting on you, Bulma!

130
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:46,620
Be careful. I'm not like
those guys. I'm delicate, okay?

131
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,220
Okay, we go.

132
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,170
Easy... easy, now...

133
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,770
H-How did he do that just now?

134
00:11:56,810 --> 00:12:02,470
Still, what kind of spaceship is it?
Could there really be one?

135
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,970
Here.

136
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,200
Already?

137
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,050
Get off.

138
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,580
W-Where is this? It's pretty cold.

139
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,290
Yunzabit Highlands.

140
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,730
Y-Yunzabit?!

141
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,800
That's the ends of the earth, you know!

142
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,570
You mean, we came
this far in that one instant?

143
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,370
Here, maybe...

144
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,400
This way, maybe...

145
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,210
W-Wait up!

146
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,790
Say, do you mean there's
something like a spaceship here?

147
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,590
Hey, are you listening to me?

148
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,940
You haven't brought me
here to this far-flung place...

149
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:50,420
...for the purpose of doing
anything indecent to me, right?

150
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,880
H-Hang on!

151
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,290
Hurry up.

152
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:00,630
Y-You're kidding, right? I can't do that!

153
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,760
Geez...

154
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,600
This thing.

155
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,390
Is this spaceship?

156
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,620
I-I'll have to examine it...

157
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,070
What is this? It's not metal. Could this be?

158
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:51,770
Hang on, what's going on?
Tell me what this is, exactly!

159
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,790
About a hundred years ago,
Kami<i>-sama</i> told Mister Popo of old times.

160
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,490
Strange story.

161
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:11,960
Kami<i>-sama</i> said lived here in
Yunzabit when child. Mister Popo asked him...

162
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,970
"Yunzabit remote region. People
not live there, so why you there?"

163
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:23,370
I don't know why I was
there. I must have hit my head,

164
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,710
and lost all of my memories up to that point.

165
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,540
Had no parents?

166
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,780
No, I didn't. All I had was a letter
that said they would be coming later.

167
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,720
What does that mean?
I don't see where this story is going.

168
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:45,790
Kami<i>-sama</i> as child waited long time for
parents. Not knew what happened, but waited.

169
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,860
I had my house there in Yunzabit, after all.

170
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,470
I trusted that my parents
would surely return there.

171
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:59,510
However, no matter how long I waited,
nobody ever came. It was hard on me.

172
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,510
There was hardly anything there
to eat, either. How long did I wait there?

173
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,920
Twenty years? No,
it must have been thirty years.

174
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,920
Finally, I gave up, and, leaving
my house behind, I left Yunzabit.

175
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,930
Once in a while, I went back to see how it
was doing, but there was never any change.

176
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,930
So, what does that have to do with this?

177
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,210
You impatient. Here come point of story.

178
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:34,380
But you know, thinking back
on it now, it was a strange house.

179
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,740
I didn't realize it until I had
learned more about the world,

180
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:39,780
but that house was really quite unusual.

181
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,950
It was round, with four legs,
and looked almost like an insect.

182
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,260
Its door didn't have any knobs or locks,
but would open when a word was spoken to it.

183
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,600
"Piccolo."

184
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,670
An entrance!

185
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,180
Get up on there.

186
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,590
This is Kami<i>-sama</i>'s house?

187
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,790
Say again to close.

188
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,190
"Piccolo."

189
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,550
Look close. This not
house, but rather, spaceship?

190
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,950
That's right! Kami<i>-sama</i> is a Namekian!

191
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,780
That Kaio person said that long ago,

192
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,290
Planet Namek went through some
abnormal weather, and they nearly died out.

193
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,590
Mister Popo also heard
Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s voice speaking.

194
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,860
Then remembered story of this house.

195
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,800
Thought "what if," came
here searching, and this here.

196
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,330
If this really is a spaceship, then your
story earlier would indeed be consistent.

197
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,970
When Planet Namek had bad time,

198
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,780
Kami<i>-sama</i>'s parents put child
Kami<i>-sama</i> aboard, sent to Earth.

199
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,550
His parents meant to escape
afterward, when they were able to,

200
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,550
but there was some kind of accident...

201
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,950
which is to say, they died...

202
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,720
That's it! After all, no matter how you look
at this thing, it doesn't seem like a house.

203
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,560
This has to be a spaceship!

204
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,960
But even if that's so, can we use it or not?

205
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,930
The door moved, so it has to have power, right?

206
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,970
Is this the main switch?

207
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,840
Nope. Well, what about this?

208
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,250
It's not this, either.

209
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,250
That's odd. I wonder if
there's a code number or something.

210
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,850
Sure, that's it. If it worked as easily as that,

211
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,160
then when Kami<i>-sama</i> was a child,
he would have tried pushing them, too.

212
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,160
It looks like this thing
doesn't work using switches.

213
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,500
I wonder if Bulma<i>-san</i>
will really find anything for us.

214
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,170
All we can do now is pray.

215
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,770
<i>We're counting on you,</i>
<i>Bulma. This is for everyone.</i>

216
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,510
I don't get it.

217
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,780
Could it be some kind of sensor?

218
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,750
Voice?

219
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:26,950
Yes! Like with the entrance! Words!

220
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,380
Say what? "Piccolo"?

221
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,920
Not that! After all, that's the
password you use for going in and out.

222
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,800
Work! Do you hear me?
Fly! Let me see you fly!

223
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,970
It's no use. The language is different.
You have to speak Namekian.

224
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,740
After all, back at that Tenkaichi Tournament,

225
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,180
Kami<i>-sama</i> and Piccolo
spoke in that strange language.

226
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,480
That must be the Namekian language.

227
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,720
Supposing that Namekian language,
Mister Popo knows those words.

228
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,290
Really?!

229
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:15,660
Really. "Piccolo" means "other world"
in those words. That why password for door.

230
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,070
Why didn't you say so sooner?

231
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,670
So that's it. "Piccolo Daimao"
means the Demon King of Another World.

232
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,840
Try saying something
in Namekian. Tell it to fly.

233
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,680
Fly where?

234
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,680
Anywhere is fine!

235
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,980
I know, how about
around Jupiter for now?

236
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,630
It says "acknowledged."

237
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,190
What is this?! Doesn't this
spaceship have any safety belts?!

238
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,850
What is that thing?!

239
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:15,590
Just now, you said
"want to go toilet" in Namekian.

240
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,000
You said "safety belt," right?

241
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:24,600
This is all too complicated!
We have to be careful what we say!

242
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,180
"Complicated" means "time for bed."

243
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,410
Incredible! It's Jupiter!
This is an incredible spaceship!

244
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,220
We did it! We did it, we did it!

245
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,750
Thank goodness. Now
Kami<i>-sama</i> come back to life.

246
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,920
<i>A spaceship has been found.</i>

247
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,800
<i>Now all that remains is a</i>
<i>departure for Planet Namek.</i>

248
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,280
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

249
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,160
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

250
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,530
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

251
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,030
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

252
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,510
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

253
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:15,610
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

254
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,110
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

255
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,780
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

256
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:29,290
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

257
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,330
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

258
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,200
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

259
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,270
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

260
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:44,940
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

261
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,110
<i>So sorry.</i>

262
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:52,210
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

263
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,190
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

264
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

265
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,970
<i>Chichi, let Gohan go off into space willingly.</i>

266
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:21,340
<i>Mother, we have to bring</i>
<i>those who died protecting the Earth</i>

267
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,350
<i>back to life, to fight</i>
<i>against the Saiyan once again!</i>

268
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,310
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

269
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,750
<i>"Blast-off for Planet Namek!</i>
<i>The Terror Awaiting Gohan & Co."</i>

270
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,600
<i>G-Gohan-chan, you've turned into a delinquent!</i>

271
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,900
"Next time"
"Blast-off for Planet Namek!
The Terror Awaiting Gohan & Co."
