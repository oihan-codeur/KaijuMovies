00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:51,615
Er, is that Majin Boo?

25
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:57,785
Th-That's right! I would never
forget th-that terrifying face!

26
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:36,205
<i>Finally, Majin Boo has been revived.</i>

27
00:03:36,245 --> 00:03:42,995
<i>However, is a guy such as</i>

<i>"A Straight Line to Despair!?</i>

Wait, Vegeta!

30
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:36,805
A <i>ki</i>! An enormous <i>ki</i> has appeared!

31
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:45,185
He has emerged after all! Majin Boo!

32
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:12,845
Majin Boo, huh?

33
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:15,425
Here I was wondering how
incredible a brute he was,

34
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,215
and then he has this
sort of battle power rating?

35
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:22,725
I thought it would be something like this!

36
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:29,105
Listen, Kakarrot! We have
now become overly strong!

37
00:05:29,145 --> 00:05:31,775
Altogether extraordinarily so!

38
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:36,575
Have you even once thought that Kaioshin,

39
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:39,195
who all else aside should be
this incredible guy, was impressive?

40
00:05:39,235 --> 00:05:45,625
Just the opposite, Kaioshin has been the
one who was surprised by our power, right?

41
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:50,965
In other words, I'm saying that Kaioshin
may see Majin Boo as a fearsome enemy,

42
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:55,545
but from where we stand,
he's not all that formidable a guy.

43
00:05:55,585 --> 00:06:00,515
N-No, that ain't it. There's something
different than usual about this <i>ki</i>!

44
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:02,645
Stop fretting around!

45
00:06:02,685 --> 00:06:05,935
If you're trying to get out of
this fight, you're not going to!

46
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:08,935
Vegeta! You have to have realized it as well!

47
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:23,955
Hey, Majin Boo!

48
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:31,165
I-I'm Babidi, the child of
Bibidi, who created you!

49
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:37,925
I've revived you after you were sealed
up in your ball for an incredibly long time!

50
00:06:43,555 --> 00:06:47,645
A-And so, starting
today, I will be your master!

51
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:03,995
Hey! What's the matter? Answer me!

52
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:07,535
You'll at least answer me! I am your master!

53
00:07:07,575 --> 00:07:09,035
Hey, Majin Boo!

54
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:16,005
Hey, there!

55
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:19,085
W-What's the matter, Majin Boo?

56
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,285
He's a mere buffoon!

57
00:07:51,535 --> 00:07:53,795
What is it he might be doing?

58
00:08:01,965 --> 00:08:03,925
W-Why you...!

59
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:09,055
I do not know why, but it
appears his revival was unsuccessful.

60
00:08:09,095 --> 00:08:11,435
Now that he has finally gone and appeared,

61
00:08:11,475 --> 00:08:15,065
what is he but a mindless,
powerless, half-witted punk?

62
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:24,985
What is it? You have something to say to me?

63
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:29,955
I'm upset!!

64
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:43,345
What?! Are you saying you
want to have a go at Dabura-<i>sama</i>?

65
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:50,975
You don't know your own place!
That's why I say you're a fool!

66
00:08:55,015 --> 00:08:59,815
It looks as though Majin Boo
has been botched, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

67
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:04,025
Does it look like he was
botched? That is Majin Boo!

68
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,385
Worthless bravado!

69
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:40,125
M-Magnificent!

70
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:43,875
Incredible, Majin Boo!

71
00:10:43,915 --> 00:10:46,675
To think how easily you defeated Dabura there!

72
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:49,095
Utterly magnificent!

73
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:57,645
It rose! Majin Boo's <i>ki</i> rose explosively!

74
00:10:58,435 --> 00:11:01,815
H-He's strong! He's too strong!

75
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:03,645
Such unbelievable strength...!

76
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:13,285
It transformed into
an extraordinary <i>ki</i> there!

77
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:18,285
He's no ordinary guy after all, this Majin Boo!

78
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:30,885
J-Just now, for just a moment,
we felt an amazing <i>ki</i>, right?

79
00:11:30,925 --> 00:11:34,305
Y-Yeah...

80
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,305
What's going on here, really?

81
00:11:37,345 --> 00:11:39,515
Say, which way should we go?

82
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:45,815
Let's see... The <i>ki</i> over this
way is kind of a spooky <i>ki</i>, right?

83
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,905
The Majin must be this way!

84
00:11:47,945 --> 00:11:52,325
Yeah! The Majin has to be more
interesting than the other, right?

85
00:11:52,365 --> 00:11:53,325
Yeah!

86
00:11:53,365 --> 00:11:55,495
All right! That settles it! Go!

87
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:06,145
<i>That wasn't any kind of trick...</i>

88
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:11,985
"Tenkaichi Tournament"

89
00:13:46,355 --> 00:13:50,355
<i>Who the hell are those guys?</i>

90
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:09,085
<i>Is there something...</i>

91
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:13,625
<i>Is there something about to happen again?</i>

92
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:20,515
–Mister Satan, congratulations on your victory!
–Congratulations!

93
00:14:20,555 --> 00:14:23,225
How was it? Any observations
about this tournament?

94
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:29,685
Well, of course, it ended
up just as I said, didn't it?

95
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:52,045
This ain't the time for us to
be doing something like this!

96
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:55,635
We're the ones that let that monster out!

97
00:14:55,675 --> 00:15:00,425
Do I care?! It has nothing to do with our fight!

98
00:15:00,675 --> 00:15:05,685
Everyone's going to be killed!
Everyone! Bulma and Trunks, too!

99
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:11,475
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

100
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:17,655
I sold my soul over to Babidi in
order to wipe out that placidity!

101
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:21,615
It's none of my concern
what happens to anyone!

102
00:15:23,535 --> 00:15:24,745
You're lying!

103
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:26,785
You're lying!!

104
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:43,555
You ain't sold your soul over entirely.

105
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:04,035
All right.

106
00:16:04,075 --> 00:16:05,995
We'll postpone the fight.

107
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:09,745
After all, Majin Boo is apparently worrying you

108
00:16:09,785 --> 00:16:12,045
and you can't seem to concentrate.

109
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:14,045
Vegeta!

110
00:16:14,085 --> 00:16:16,755
Hand over one of those <i>senzu</i> things.

111
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:21,585
We've both lost quite a bit of power, after all.

112
00:16:28,515 --> 00:16:32,265
If we all work together,
I'm sure we can beat Majin Boo!

113
00:16:59,045 --> 00:17:03,845
Not even you could help
having been caught off guard.

114
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:38,205
I am the one who released Majin Boo,

115
00:17:38,245 --> 00:17:40,375
and I will be the one to put him away.

116
00:17:42,925 --> 00:17:45,345
Settling up with you will come afterward...

117
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,015
If I'm still alive.

118
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:17,415
Incredible! You're incredible!

119
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:21,835
Now, Majin Boo, do as I tell you!

120
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:25,635
I am your new master!

121
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:29,715
You defy me?

122
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:38,065
A-Are you sure it's okay to disobey me?

123
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:40,275
I've seen my papa's notes,

124
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:45,735
and I know something–the
spell to seal you up in your ball!

125
00:18:47,485 --> 00:18:50,785
You don't want to go back in there, do you?

126
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:01,835
All right! That will do! That will do!

127
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:09,345
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, isn't Majin
Boo still something like a child?

128
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:15,975
If we defeat Babidi there, would he
perhaps not do such maniacal things?

129
00:19:16,015 --> 00:19:17,765
Th-That won't do!

130
00:19:17,805 --> 00:19:23,815
If Babidi is gone, then it will become
impossible to seal up Majin Boo again!

131
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:28,445
Despite how he appears, Majin
Boo is really a terrible monster!

132
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:31,825
Before long, he will grow
beyond Babidi's control,

133
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:37,825
and then, the time when he is
sealed up again is sure to come!

134
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:41,995
Until that time, all we
can do is patiently sit tight.

135
00:19:42,035 --> 00:19:45,215
E-Even though I am a Kaioshin,

136
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:49,925
I am helplessly chagrined at
myself that there is nothing I can do.

137
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:52,175
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

138
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:57,935
I was sure I would be able to defeat
Babidi and halt Majin Boo's revival!

139
00:19:57,975 --> 00:20:00,855
I-If I knew it was to be like this...

140
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,975
If I had known that
there were those such as you,

141
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:08,355
who even while being human, had
power which so greatly surpassed my own...

142
00:20:08,395 --> 00:20:12,365
And despite having that other method...!

143
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:14,945
Other method?

144
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:17,035
No, it's too late.

145
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:20,955
We can no longer escape from Majin Boo.

146
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:22,955
The two of us will not likely return alive.

147
00:20:22,995 --> 00:20:25,005
What are you saying?!

148
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:27,965
If it's just escaping, we can
manage something or other!

149
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,335
All right!

150
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:34,885
Okay, Majin Boo, this is your first command.

151
00:20:34,925 --> 00:20:37,675
Kill those two there!

152
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:43,935
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

153
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:53,945
It's okay! I can count on my speed!

154
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:58,785
What are you doing, Boo?
You're letting them get away!

155
00:21:17,385 --> 00:21:19,975
H-He's disappeared!

156
00:21:50,835 --> 00:21:52,005
It can't be!

157
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:57,005
You die!

158
00:22:12,855 --> 00:22:17,985
<i>W-What's this?! Majin Boo</i>
<i>is one extraordinary fellow!</i>

159
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:21,905
<i>He has wondrous speed and power!</i>

160
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:26,705
<i>Behind that merciless</i>
<i>smile lurks the terror of death!</i>

161
00:22:34,255 --> 00:22:38,845
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

162
00:22:40,595 --> 00:22:45,435
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

163
00:22:49,685 --> 00:22:55,985
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

164
00:22:56,025 --> 00:23:02,115
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

165
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:09,125
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

166
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:14,505
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

167
00:23:15,165 --> 00:23:18,385
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

168
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:27,435
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

169
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:28,975
<i>Even now?</i>

170
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:36,605
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

171
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:42,035
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

172
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:48,495
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

173
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:58,545
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

174
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:15,735
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

175
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:20,615
<i>What a beast! Gohan's</i>
<i>full-power attack had no effect at all.</i>

176
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:25,785
<i>Now it's our turn! Majin Boo,</i>
<i>get them back good!</i>

177
00:24:25,825 --> 00:24:29,495
<i>Go! Send them off into space!</i>

178
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,705
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

179
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:35,205
<i>"The Terrifying Majin!!</i>
<i>Death's Dread Draws Near Gohan."</i>

180
00:24:36,125 --> 00:24:39,625
"Next time"
"The Terrifying Majin!!
Death's Dread Draws Near Gohan"
