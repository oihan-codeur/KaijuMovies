Where is this place?

22
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,650
I wonder if I've arrived at Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s
place without even realizing it.

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,820

the Tree of Circular Life <i>oni</i>!

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,170
You mean I can't eat those?

30
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,310
Of course not <i>oni.</i>

31
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,380
Those are precious fruit that only
the Great King Yama<i>-sama</i> may eat <i>oni.</i>

32
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,220
I'm just so hungry, you see...

You're hungry?

34
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,660
You say the most ridiculous
things <i>oni.</i> Who are you <i>oni</i>?

35
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,260
What have you come here for <i>oni</i>?

36
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,410
I'm Goku. Son Goku. I came here to
train. Which one of you is Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,470
Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

Then you guys ain't Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

39
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,940
Of course not <i>oni.</i>
Where do you think you are <i>oni</i>?

40
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,020
This is the third street of
the first district of Hell <i>oni.</i>

41
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,790
We are the watch-keeper ogres of this area <i>oni.</i>

42
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,290
This is Hell?! Then I've fallen
down from the Serpentine Road!

43
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:49,780
Damn it, man, how am I supposed to
climb up this thing, for crying out loud?

44
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,150
Hey, Tenshinhan!
Don't you leave me behind!

45
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,970
<i>Goku, I will travel the</i>
<i>same road that you have!</i>

46
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,440
<i>But I will become even</i>
<i>stronger, just you watch!</i>

47
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,440
Ten<i>-san</i>, how do you
suppose Kami<i>-sama</i> will train us?

48
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:28,580
I don't know. But this
is Kami<i>-sama</i>, after all.

49
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,450
It will probably be something
we couldn't even imagine.

50
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,620
Chaozu, no matter what the training is,
don't become disheartened!

51
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,990
Mm-hmm!

52
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,270
This sure is one hard-up house...

53
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,180
What are you doing?

54
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,450
Oh, you know. If there was an
airplane capsule or something in here,

55
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,320
I was going to borrow it.

56
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,460
There is nothing like that in there.
You should leave here at once.

57
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,460
You <i>do</i> have money in here.

58
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,660
If I do not have it, it's not in there.

59
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,700
Just do as I tell you
and give me an airplane!

60
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,300
What is the matter, Noble Father?!

61
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,200
Upa!

62
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,470
It's nothing, Upa.

63
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,270
What are you doing to Noble Father?!

64
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,150
Don't come any closer!

65
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,550
Why, you–!

66
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,930
Huh?

67
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,520
We can kill some time
with him for a while <i>oni</i>!

68
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,490
It's been 1,500 years since we had
a flesh-and-blood dead person here <i>oni</i>!

69
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,890
He seems to be pretty lively, too.

70
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,530
It's been so long since we had
someone to make us move about <i>oni.</i>

71
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,870
You can't <i>oni</i>! You've got a
mountain of paperwork stacked up <i>oni</i>!

72
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,400
It doesn't matter <i>oni</i>! We have
equal responsibility for that <i>oni</i>!

73
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,280
–Then it's no use <i>oni</i>!
–You wanna go at it?

74
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,110
–Rock, scissors, paper!
–Rock, scissors, paper!

75
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,620
Look that way now!

76
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,450
Work hard, now <i>oni</i>!

77
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,430
Be sure to leave some for me <i>oni</i>!

78
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,990
First come, first served <i>oni</i>!

79
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,230
Maybe this is impossible after all...

80
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,470
What are you doing <i>oni</i>?

81
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,100
You can tell just by watching, can't you?

82
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,740
I want to hurry and get
back to the Serpentine Road.

83
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,250
You want to get back
that badly, do you <i>oni</i>?

84
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,450
What are you doing?!

85
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,580
I'll send you back <i>oni</i>!

86
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,500
"River Sanzu Branch Office"

87
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:32,300
Oh? That Gozu bastard is finishing
everything so easily again <i>oni</i>! I knew it!

88
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,600
What a simple-minded, foolish ogre <i>oni</i>!

89
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,550
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

90
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,560
That guy!

91
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,860
Pops, you ain't got any power, huh?
I didn't even make it there!

92
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,960
What?!

93
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,040
I'm the second strongest ogre next to
Great King Yama<i>-sama</i> in all of Hell <i>oni</i>!

94
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,140
I heard that Great King Yama was incredibly
strong, but maybe he's not all that great.

95
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,040
You want to try taking me on then <i>oni</i>?!

96
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,880
I ain't got that kind of spare time.

97
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,050
If you can beat me in a contest,

98
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,980
I'll give you a chance to get
back to the Serpentine Road <i>oni</i>!

99
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,220
It's the jump device we keep just in case <i>oni.</i>

100
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,450
Really?

101
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,460
We don't lie <i>oni.</i>

102
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,460
If we lie, then we get our tongues
pulled out by Great King Yama<i>-sama oni.</i>

103
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,130
I'll do it! I'm going to do it!

104
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,470
In exchange, if you lose,
you forfeit your soul <i>oni.</i>

105
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,470
You won't be able to keep
your body while you're dead <i>oni</i>!

106
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,210
That's fine. I'm going to win, after all.

107
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,490
If you go outside of this line,
you lose <i>oni.</i> You got that?

108
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,130
Whatever is fine,
let's just do this quickly!

109
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,140
You're one bothersome guy, huh <i>oni</i>?

110
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:19,370
It takes some preparation...
to get ready for this <i>oni...</i>

111
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,240
All right, let's go <i>oni</i>!

112
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,610
You got it!

113
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,780
Take your marks...

114
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,650
...begin <i>oni</i>!

115
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,790
You're better than I thought, Pops.

116
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,730
Wha<i>– oni</i>?

117
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,230
U-Unbelievable power <i>oni</i>!

118
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,240
Here I go, Pops!

119
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,290
This is the jump device, is it?

120
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:16,730
That's right <i>oni</i>! I'm going to jump
up as hard as I can and land up here,

121
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,230
and when I do, you jump <i>oni.</i>

122
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,500
Fine, just hurry up and do it.

123
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,340
All right, here goes!

124
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,680
It's working, it's working!

125
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,350
A little farther...

126
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:52,960
Ka... me... ha... me...

127
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,230
<i>...Ha!</i>

128
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,470
That did it!

129
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,380
What's with those clouds?
They're terribly hard!

130
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,370
"To the summit. Please do not litter."
Number 34,265...

131
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,710
Number 34,266...
"Mountain of Needles"

132
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,150
"The Original Needle Bean Jam Buns"
Number 34,267...

133
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,160
Number 34,268...

134
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,390
Number 34,269...

135
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,660
No one is absent, then.

136
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,760
Today, as I'm sure
everyone is looking forward to,

137
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,930
we will be having an outing
on the Mountain of Needles <i>oni.</i>

138
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,440
Stay sharp as you ascend
and come back down <i>oni.</i>

139
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,220
Hurry up and get going <i>oni.</i>
Come on, come on, step on it–

140
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,080
Geez, is he still playing all by
himself <i>oni</i>? That's not fair <i>oni</i>!

141
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
How long are you going
to keep goofing around <i>oni</i>?

142
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,570
It's my turn now <i>oni.</i>

143
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:38,540
It's no use. No matter how many times I try,

144
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,970
I can't break through those clouds.

145
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,140
Your head is just too soft <i>oni.</i>

146
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,110
But then, has there ever been
anyone who has broken through there?

147
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,950
Not yet <i>oni.</i>

148
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,880
What? Have you tricked me?!

149
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,720
Hey, you!

150
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,790
So, in a nutshell, you just want to return
to the Serpentine Road, is that right <i>oni</i>?

151
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:57,460
If so, there's a very
good way to do so <i>oni.</i>

152
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,720
Really? Tell me!

153
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,560
There's a secret path that
nobody else knows about <i>oni.</i>

154
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,130
Mezu, you can't show him that <i>oni</i>!

155
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,830
Tell me about it! I'm begging you!

156
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,970
There is one condition <i>oni.</i>

157
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,210
Condition?

158
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,980
I'm going to start running
around through Hell here <i>oni.</i>

159
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
If you are good enough
to be able to catch me,

160
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,520
I'll tell you where
the secret path is <i>oni.</i>

161
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,520
I'm supposed to chase you?

162
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,130
That's right <i>oni</i>! In this game, you
really will have to run like the devil <i>oni</i>!

163
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,150
Over here, over here!

164
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,090
I think this should be enough for today.

165
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,260
Over here, over here!

166
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,730
Hurry, hurry!

167
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,300
Over here, over here!

168
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:54,110
Are you ready <i>oni</i>?

169
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,010
Any time is fine by me.

170
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:01,550
I'll just warn you that they say my speed
is second only to Great King Yama<i>-sama oni.</i>

171
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,110
If you lose...

172
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,920
I know! Come on, let's hurry and do this.

173
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:14,160
All right then, let's begin <i>oni.</i> Ready!

174
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,170
He is fast!

175
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,990
Wait up!

176
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,780
Wait up, wait up!

177
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,190
Now he'll just run around
until he's all worn out <i>oni.</i>

178
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,860
What a waste. And
flesh-and-blood dead people are so rare...

179
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,570
You're pretty fast, aren't you <i>oni</i>?

180
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,140
Yeah, I suppose so.

181
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,840
If you weren't, then this
wouldn't be any fun <i>oni</i>!

182
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:23,000
I was so close! And he
even dropped his guard, too!

183
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,170
That's awesome! All right, then!

184
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:45,590
No matter how tough he may be,
he can't come all the way up here <i>oni.</i>

185
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,730
W-What <i>oni</i>?!

186
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,000
Hold it!

187
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,190
Hold it!

188
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,860
This is fun <i>oni</i>! How
about you live here with us <i>oni</i>?

189
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,730
If you do that, we can play tag every day <i>oni</i>!

190
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,140
You're right! But I can't... let that happen!

191
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,910
What's the matter <i>oni</i>? You'll never
get to where Kaio<i>-sama</i> is like this <i>oni</i>!

192
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:48,080
Damn, I was so close, too.

193
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,790
He's something else <i>oni.</i>

194
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,430
Hold on a minute, would you? I'm all tired out!

195
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,560
You're just a wuss <i>oni...</i>

196
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,840
Say, let me eat some
of the fruit on that tree.

197
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,140
No way <i>oni</i>! If you eat
one of those precious fruits,

198
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,710
they say that you will avoid
hunger for a hundred days,

199
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,140
and your power will be bolstered <i>oni.</i>

200
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:23,080
They're that valuable, are they?

201
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,320
That's right.

202
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:29,950
Hey, you! Hold it!
If one of those gets eaten,

203
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,190
I'll get chewed out by
Great King Yama<i>-sama oni</i>!

204
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,730
Come on! Come on, come on!
Hold it <i>oni</i>! Come on! Come on!

205
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,300
Before you know it, the game
of chase got switched around <i>oni.</i>

206
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,970
Here goes! Gotcha! I did it!

207
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,640
You idiot <i>oni</i>!

208
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,480
Okay, you promised.
Show me the way out.

209
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,180
I was off my guard <i>oni.</i>
L-Let's do it again <i>oni</i>?

210
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,280
Are you thinking of breaking your promise?

211
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,660
Great King Yama will yank your tongue out!

212
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,850
It's over there <i>oni</i>!

213
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,610
If you climb the stairs inside here,

214
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,880
you'll return to the Serpentine Road <i>oni.</i>

215
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,840
See you later, then!

216
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,180
Get out of here now <i>oni</i>!

217
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,240
Sorry about this, but I took one of them.

218
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,750
Because of you, I'm famished!

219
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,490
See you!

220
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,490
You dumb bastard <i>oni</i>!

221
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,500
Don't come here again <i>oni</i>!

222
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,300
He's gone <i>oni.</i>

223
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,370
There's absolutely nothing
to be done about him <i>oni.</i>

224
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,370
Eh, oh well <i>oni.</i>

225
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,810
That was fun <i>oni...</i>

226
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,810
Okay then, to work, to work!
There's a mountain of paperwork piled up <i>oni.</i>

227
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,220
Let's go at it as best we can <i>oni.</i>

228
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,390
These stairs sure are long!

229
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,430
Is that the exit?

230
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,340
Huh? It won't move. All right, then!

231
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,410
I made it!

232
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,120
What are you doing in there?

233
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,450
G-Great King Yama<i>-sama</i>?!

234
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,290
Did you see Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

235
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:48,460
Um, by any chance, is this–? Goodbye!

236
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,300
W-What's with him?

237
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,400
What's this?! I have to
start at the beginning again?!

238
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,470
You've got to be kidding!

239
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:59,100
I really have to hurry now,
or I ain't going to have enough time!

240
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,870
That's strange. It's a lot
easier to run now than before.

241
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:04,750
I wonder if that's because of that fruit.

242
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,480
<i>Goku has unexpectedly</i>
<i>returned to the starting point.</i>

243
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,120
<i>The road to Kaio-sama's</i>
<i>place is incredibly long.</i>

244
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,830
<i>Hurry, Goku! The Saiyans</i>
<i>are getting closer every minute!</i>

245
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,720
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

246
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,630
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

247
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

248
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,500
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

249
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,980
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

250
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,050
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

251
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,550
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

252
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,220
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

253
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,700
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

254
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,830
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

255
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,670
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

256
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:39,700
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

257
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,380
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

258
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,550
<i>So sorry.</i>

259
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,650
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

261

<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

262
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,580
<i>Huh? A house, here? I get it, this must be</i>
<i>Kaio-sama's house, right?</i>

263
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,380
<i>The Snake Princess-sama approaches!</i>

<i>K-Kaio-sama, you're a woman?</i>

<i>"Such Sweet Temptation!</i>
