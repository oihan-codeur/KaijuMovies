Piccolo, squash him!

20

Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

That sure looks like fun.

27
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:33,315
That contemptible Piccolo!
Is he trying to kill us too?

28
00:06:25,895 --> 00:06:28,525
How truly delightful!

29
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:31,195
The pupil who he trained
as his own apprentice...

30
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:33,535
...is now being destroyed by his own hand!

31
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:37,065
This is so characteristic
of a Demon Clansman!

32
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:44,445
Kami, you should watch this too.

33
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:50,045
The moment your own alter ego
crosses over to the glorious Demon side!

34
00:07:06,235 --> 00:07:07,705
Dammit!

35
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:29,055
That's enough. Leave the rest up to us.

36
00:07:38,135 --> 00:07:40,475
This is for Tard and Zald!

37

Brace yourself, kid!

38
00:08:00,265 --> 00:08:03,895
That creep! Is he planning
to keep us out of this?

39
00:08:03,935 --> 00:08:07,795
From the start, Piccolo and
Son Goku were bitter adversaries.

40
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:11,365
Perhaps when he entered the Demon Clan,

41
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:14,395
some dormant hatred
within him was released.

42
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:31,585
Pic... colo<i>-san...</i>

43
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:19,735
Now!

44
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:31,415
You asinine fool!

45
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:40,685
Did you really think you could
take this away from me just like that?!

46
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:50,365
Can you take it now?

47
00:09:50,405 --> 00:09:55,395
Come on, what's the matter?
Hurry up and take it!

48
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:59,435
Now go to hell!

49
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:15,525
Kuri... rin<i>... -san...</i>

50
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,395
Loathsome trash! Say your prayers.

51
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:34,675
Stop!

52
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:36,645

54
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:25,095
Look out, Gohan!

55
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:03,895
Stop!

56
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:11,405
Please stop, Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

57
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,165
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

58
00:13:05,265 --> 00:13:06,695
Here you go.

59
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:26,545
I did it! That's 22 wins in a row.

60
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:33,585
Hey, you! You can read minds,
can'tcha? Why don'tcha use that?

61
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:37,255
You hush! I was reading
her mind and still lost.

62
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:38,595
What?

63
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:41,465
This girl doesn't think anything.

64
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,465
That'd explain it.

65
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,905
I'll take this, then.

66
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:52,145
So this bell is required to
get to the Heavenly Realm.

67
00:13:54,545 --> 00:13:57,515
Okay then, what do you bet next?

68
00:13:57,555 --> 00:13:58,845
This!

69
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:01,585
It is another instrument necessary
to get to the Heavenly Realm.

70
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:04,955
This is the Nyoi Bo, and
can also be used as a weapon.

71
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,925
Karin<i>-sama</i>! Ain't this somehow wrong?

72
00:14:09,965 --> 00:14:14,765
You be quiet! How can you be
satisfied with her shutting us out?

73
00:14:14,805 --> 00:14:18,495
Kurin<i>-chan</i>'s friends are so
much fun, every single one of them!

74
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:23,935
Well, let's play! Let's play,
let's play! I won't lose this time!

75
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:28,935
Take your time, take your time!
Remember what's riding on this!

76
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,825
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

77
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,965
Please, come out of it, Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

78
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,345
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

79
00:15:55,535 --> 00:16:00,375
Very well. You shall
become our newest member.

80
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:08,295
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

81
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:28,215
You'll have to thank Piccolo.

82
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:32,715
You get to see the bottle of
Ultra Holy Water before you die.

83
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,225
That's it?

84
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:46,065
Whoa, the way ahead is a restricted area!

85
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,445
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

86
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:13,555
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

87
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:23,645
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, don't tell me you too...

88
00:19:29,285 --> 00:19:32,245
Didn't you know, kid?

89
00:19:32,285 --> 00:19:37,555
If bitten by a member of the Demon Clan,
once their saliva flows through your body,

90
00:19:37,595 --> 00:19:40,585
it's the same as if you had
breathed in the Aquamist...

91
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:43,225
...you become a Demon Clansman!

92
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:49,505
Give it up, kid. You're all by yourself!

93
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:54,975
Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i>, we request that
we be allowed to finish this one off!

94
00:19:55,245 --> 00:20:00,615
Of course, we will save the final
blow for yourself, Garlic Jr<i>.-sama.</i>

95
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,735
Fine.

96
00:20:19,865 --> 00:20:21,165
How can you...?

97
00:20:43,555 --> 00:20:47,995
Wait. Didn't I say I would
strike the finishing blow?

98
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,295
So you did.

99
00:20:56,165 --> 00:20:56,695
Kuririn!

100
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:24,565
You–how?!

101
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:28,395
You really expected me to do as you wanted?

102
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:54,185
Yeah, but you could have
pulled your punches a little.

103
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:56,385
I mean, poor Gohan!

104
00:21:57,895 --> 00:22:02,735
He's trained hard enough that our
level of attack wouldn't have worn him out.

105
00:22:07,645 --> 00:22:10,935
Why, you!

106
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:14,315
How dare you deceive me so!

107
