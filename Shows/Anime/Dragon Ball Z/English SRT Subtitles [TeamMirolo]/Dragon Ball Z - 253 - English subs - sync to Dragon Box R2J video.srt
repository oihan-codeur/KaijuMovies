Say, Kaioshin-<i>sama,</i>

34
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,280
They've been like that for some time now.

35
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Can this 15-generation-previous
or whatever Kaioshin-<i>sama...</i>

36
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,740
...really draw out Gohan's
incredible power for him?

37
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,910
W-Well... I think it will be all right...

38
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,960
He certainly seemed to
be quite sure of himself.

39
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,310
U-Um, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>...?

W-What?

42
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,700
You were just sleeping, weren't you?

43
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,870
D-Don't be ridiculous!
There's no way I would go to sleep!

44
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,920
I was undeniably awake!

45
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,750
That I don't believe.

46
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,170
Well, it may have looked
that way, to an amateur.

47
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,760
And Kaioshin don't
generally tell lies, you know.

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,270
Okay, this is no time to be
speaking of the unnecessary, right?

49
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,890

52
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:04,290
All right! We're about to begin!
It's Super Saiyan Fusion!

53
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,290
Right!

54
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,720
Now listen. This time, even if your
Fusion is successful, do not get carried away!

55
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,510
You know Majin Boo's strength now, right?

56
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,850
We know!

57
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,230
All right. Do it!!

58
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,740
Okay, your <i>ki</i> are exactly
the same. Begin the Fusion!

59
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,430
Fusion Ha!!

60
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:50,610
A-Awesome! He's awesome!

61
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,990
They did it! It's a complete success!

62
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,280
Your <i>ki</i> is certainly something incredible,

63
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,030
but what about your movements?

64
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,530
Show me a bit of what you got.

65
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,040
You sure that's okay?
Showing you here in a place like this?

66
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,250
W-What?!

67
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:11,420
I can't be sure the buildings
here won't get all broken up!

68
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,670
I'll do it down on the ground!

69
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,670
W-Wait!

70
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,130
Yahoo!

71
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,220
It's no good! His over-inflated
attitude hasn't gotten any better!

72
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,160
Sheesh! What insane speed he has!

73
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,040
Maybe I overdid it a little on the speed.

74
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,240
Think I'll take a quick break.

75
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,890
Let's hurry, Grandma.

76
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,060
If we don't hurry and get away from the city

77
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,560
and someplace within the mountains,
we'll be found by Majin Boo!

78
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,650
I wonder if our grandchildren
in the city got away safely.

79
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,460
G-Grandma! What's the matter?! Hey!

80
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,050
Yea! I hit her in one shot!

81
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,630
Th-This still isn't right, young master!

82
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,430
You fool, does that concern me?

83
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,600
The whole world's people
are being killed by Majin Boo!

84
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,270
Just suppose Majin Boo
was the one who killed them!

85
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,610
I've always wanted to try
shooting humans! It's the greatest!

86
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,030
I'll let you shoot the old geezer!

87
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,610
Go on, do it! That's an order!

88
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,150
Right...

89
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Hey, not too bad, was it?

90
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,740
See? Feels great, right?

91
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,990
Let's go on killing away like that!

92
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,540
Yes, that wasn't bad!

93
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,000
Yahoo! The city!

94
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,380
If we go to the city, there will be plenty
of scumbags who have still survived!

95
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,050
You're so slow! Have you finally arrived?

96
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:52,310
I went around the Earth many
times over, and even took a short nap!

97
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:58,560
Go flying off on your own, will you?
I've been looking for you!

98
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,610
You can tell simply from
my speed just now, can't you?

99
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,910
What wildly incredible power I have?

100
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,950
You sure do. However...

101
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,370
Which means, our test is over!

102
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,530
W-Wait!

103
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:18,960
I've decided to put him away
right now, that annoying Majin Boo!

104
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,050
Hey! You fool!

105
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,340
What an impossible jackass!

106
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:29,800
You can only stay merged for
another minute, you numbskull!

107
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,020
Lousy Majin Boo! This isn't going
to go the same way it did last time!

108
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,980
You're going to be sorry
you ever came across me!

109
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,350
Yea!

110
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,490
Yo, yo, yo! Majin Boo! It's me! Show your face!

111
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,120
Who's there?! Who's talking bad about me?!

112
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,340
Hey!!

113
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,310
There, you see? It's just your imagination!

114
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,520
Is there anyone that would
say anything like "Yo, yo" to you?

115
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,040
As if he were snuggling up
to Nello, Patrasche died as well.

116
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,460
The townspeople learned about what
had happened, and reflected to themselves,

117
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:51,470
"Ah, we have done such a cruel thing!"

118
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:57,810
That was funny! How fun! How fun!

119
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,980
"A Dog of Flanders"

120
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,980
Er, where are you off to?

121
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,570
Gonna go kill more people.

122
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,990
You wanna go with me?

123
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:17,990
N-No, I'll stay here and, um,
cook something until you come back.

124
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,580
Really? Your stuff is yummy,
so I look forward to it!

125
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:26,000
Of course! Be expecting some
top-notch delicious cooking, if you please!

126
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,550
Well, I'm off!

127
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,470
See you back later!

128
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,220
Good luck!

129
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,470
Stupid bastard! Don't get
too carried away with yourself!

130
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,470
Laugh it up now, while you still can!

131
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,910
With as much dynamite as this, no matter
if he is Majin Boo, he'll be blown to bits!

132
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,950
There's enough destructive power
here to blow up a tank, in any case!

133
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,330
I just have to push this remote
control switch, and it's "The End!"

134
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,420
I will have been the
one who saves the Earth!

135
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,420
I'll just hide it in here!

136
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,550
Hurry on back here, Majin Boo!

137
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,610
Yahoo!!

138
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:32,780
Die! Die! 38! 39! 40!

139
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,570
How do you like that?!

140
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,410
But still, young master, if Majin Boo
were to come here now, we'd be in trouble!

141
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,580
They say that near here
he has built himself a house!

142
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,040
You fool! If that guy were
to come here, it's no big deal!

143
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,500
I've got a powerful bazooka here!

144
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,800
I am a hero after all!

145
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,390
H-He's back here already!

146
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,940
I-I deeply apologize! I-I am still
in the middle of making your meal!

147
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,480
Hey, here.

148
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,500
I-Is something the matter with that dog?

149
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,540
He doesn't get afraid. He won't run away.

150
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,170
No matter how much I listen,
I don't know what he's saying.

151
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,290
Do you know?

152
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,800
I-I do not know what he's saying, but
it appears his leg is injured, does it not?

153
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,430
That is why he does not run away.

154
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,430
Oh, is that it?

155
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,350
I'll heal your injury for you,
so you get scared and run away!

156
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,320
There, run away!

157
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,740
I'll kill you.

158
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,340
What's with him?

159
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,920
He doesn't run away, even
though his injury is healed.

160
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,550
He is overjoyed at having you help him!

161
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,340
He has taken a liking to you, Boo-<i>san</i>!

162
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,710
Does he like me?

163
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,170
That's right! He likes you, he likes you!

164
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,880
His tail is wagging, right? He is delighted!

165
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,340
He's like you. You like me too.

166
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,930
Th-That's right!

167
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm kind of happy.

168
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,360
Here! Eat this choco!

169
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,900
Oh, no, no! Choco will not do!

170
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,320
It has to be dog food or something!

171
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,740
Dog food? What's that? I don't know that!

172
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,620
I know! Shall I go buy some dog food?

173
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,750
O-Okay, I'll go buy some,
so please wait here for me!

174
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,210
Okay!

175
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,550
This is my cha-ance!

176
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,280
You're finished!

177
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,610
Now you're finished, Majin Boo!

178
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,680
H-He looks so happy...

179
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,910
Well, that's okay. I can do this a bit later.

180
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,490
The puppy is there too,
and all... Damn it all...

181
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,850
There, you see? He's happy to eat this!

182
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,720
Yucky.

183
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:18,310
U-Um, Majin Boo-<i>sama,</i>
can I humbly ask you one thing?

184
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,730
What is it?

185
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:25,240
W-W-Why is it you k-kill people
and destroy buildings and such?

186
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Because it's fun!

187
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,870
Th-That's all?!

188
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,700
They said I can do that to play,
both by Bibidi and Babidi.

189
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,290
A-And who are they?

190
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,880
Those unpleasant guys that made me!

191
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,000
Y-You mustn't listen to
those disagreeable guys!

192
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:49,220
I-It won't do to have you
killing and destroying and so on!

193
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,430
N-No, that's fine! That's all fine,
if you find it to be fun!

194
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,230
I-I am so sorry!

195
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,860
You think it's wrong for me to do so?

196
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,860
Y-Yeah, well...

197
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,820
Okay, I'll stop!

198
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,620
Y-You're not going to kill anyone any more?

199
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,620
Mm-hmm.

200
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,240
Y-You're not going to destroy anywhere else?

201
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,660
Mm-hmm.

202
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,120
<i>I-I-I did it! I did it!</i>

203
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,540
<i>I really am the hero! Just what you'd expect!</i>

204
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,630
<i>Just what you'd expect from</i>
<i>the world champion, Mister Satan!</i>

205
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,800
Here... Young master, it's around here!

206
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,310
Majin Boo's house!

207
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,730
What, are you still afraid? I told
you, this won't be any big deal!

208
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:40,900
R-Right...

209
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,820
How engaging! It's us who are going
after him, and we're going to kill him!

210
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,790
He brought the ball right back, see?

211
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,210
Great! Great!

212
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,630
All right! Once again! Once again!

213
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,840
Go!

214
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,720
That's one down!!

215
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,730
Huh? Young master,
that fellow with Majin Boo there,

216
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,690
it's Mister Satan!

217
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,850
H-How can this happen?!

218
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,280
<i>A single, unfeeling shot</i>
<i>from a heartless villain...</i>

219
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,200
<i>Will all of Mister Satan's efforts be in vain?</i>

220
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,760
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

221
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,350
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

222
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:55,950
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

223
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:02,040
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

224
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:09,040
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

225
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,420
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

226
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,300
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

227
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:27,350
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

228
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,900
<i>Even now?</i>

229
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:36,530
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

230
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,910
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

231
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:48,420
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

232
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:58,470
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

233
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,190
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

234
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,070
<i>How can this be?</i>
<i>Thanks to a couple of bad apples,</i>

235
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,740
<i>the reformed Majin Boo's</i>
<i>evil portion has swelled up!</i>

236
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,870
<i>Satan, you and the dog run away.</i>

237
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,160
<i>If you stay here, you're gonna die.</i>

238
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,960
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

<i>"Run Away, Satan!!</i>
<i>An Angry Majin Boo Emerges."</i>

240
