<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,090
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:54,770

That was perfect! He's being born!

25
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,440
W-What?!

26
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,150
<i>Having gone through the special</i>
<i>training for the merging technique Fusion,</i>

27

<i>handed down by Goku to Goten and</i>
<i>Trunks in order to defeat Majin Boo,</i>

28
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,290
<i>the two of them merge and give birth</i>
<i>to the superhuman warrior Gotenks.</i>

29
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,960
<i>Overconfident of himself,</i>
<i>Gotenks took off by himself,</i>

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,540
<i>but was all-too-easily defeated by Boo.</i>

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,890
I got beaten up all over!

32
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,280
W-What?!

33
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,660
Everybody, everybody...

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,500
Stop!!

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,880
Now die!!

36

<i>In just one day, Boo's intensive attacks</i>

<i>have eliminated roughly 80 percent</i>
<i>of the Earth's cities and population.</i>

38
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,940
Gonna kill more and more!

<i>"The Final Weapon is Engaged!?</i>
<i>Satan Will Save the Earth."</i>

40
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,870
Just as if he were a little child,

41
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,370
<i>Majin Boo seems to enjoy</i>
<i>killing those who oppose him or,</i>

42
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,960
<i>of course, run away from him.</i>

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,590
<i>The majority of them are killed</i>
<i>by his blasts, and occasionally,</i>

44
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,590
<i>when he becomes hungry,</i>

45
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,800
<i>he turns them into candy</i>
<i>and such and eats them.</i>

46
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,770
<i>All the while, the Earth has</i>
<i>not silently looked on, but rather,</i>

47
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,560
<i>military forces have mobilized</i>
<i>against him countless times.</i>

48
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,110
<i>However, unable to do anything</i>
<i>before Majin Boo's power,</i>

49
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,570
<i>the military has been</i>
<i>obliterated at every turn,</i>

50
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,320
<i>and now, there is no one</i>
<i>left who will stand up to him.</i>

51
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,170
<i>However, the people remaining</i>
<i>have not entirely lost hope.</i>

52
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,140
<i>The reason being, the people have</i>
<i>learned through radio broadcasts</i>

53
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,600
<i>that there is still a savior who has survived.</i>

54
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,560
<i>And so, the people have</i>
<i>waited for their savior to awaken.</i>

55
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,160
<i>It is he who even defeated Cell,</i>
<i>the greatest warrior in the world–</i>

<i>no, in the universe!</i>

57
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,210
<i>He who can take pride in his</i>
<i>undefeated legend, the mightiest man...</i>

58
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,890
<i>The champion, who has</i>
<i>been resting within a shelter</i>

59
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,930
<i>to recover from the fatigue</i>
<i>of the Tenkaichi Tournament...</i>

60
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,930
<i>The awakening of Mister Satan!</i>

61
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,990
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

62
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,920
Do not worry. I will be sure
to defeat Majin Boo at any cost.

63
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,540
If you would please, be careful!

64
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,880
Looks like everyone knows it.

65
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,220
The only one who can defeat Majin Boo

66
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,590
is the strongest combatant
in the universe, Mister Satan.

67
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,530
Damn you, rotten Majin Boo!
The next time we meet...!

68
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,950
Now see here. If you move,
I can't swab this on, you know!

69
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,460
That hurts!

70
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,460
What are you talkin' about?!
You brought this on yourself!

71
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,050
Listen, Goten, you're all I've got left.

72
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:40,800
So you can't be doin' that sort of
recklessness you were pullin' earlier!

73
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,470
Got it?

74
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,640
Y-Yes...

75
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,940
You too, Trunks.

76
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,900
R-Right...

77
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,280
That's right!

78
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,990
You are the last hope the Earth here has!

79
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,500
Learn your lesson from this, and
refrain from doing anything else so rash!

80
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,870
Piccolo-<i>san</i>?

81
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,460
What is it?

82
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
My Papa was awfully strong, right?

83
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,170
Do you think I can surpass my Papa?

84
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:21,680
I want to defend the Earth, here,
the same way my Papa tried to defend it!

85
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,350
And so, for that reason as well, I have
to become even stronger than my Papa!

86
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,480
Trunks...!

87
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,820
Within your two bodies...

88
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:49,460
Within your two bodies flows
the same warrior blood that

89
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,000
has come to create possibility
from impossibility many times over.

90
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,750
You can surpass him,
at some time. I'm sure of it!

91
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,480
Now, let's start training!

92
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,400
Right!

93
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,870
Stick with it, Trunks!

94
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,530
Goten-<i>chan</i>, you stick with it too!

95
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,420
That is Majin Boo's house?

96
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,890
Y-Yes, so it seems, Mister Satan.

97
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:51,430
All right, I'll go alone from here.
Leave this entirely up to me!

98
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,400
You guys can go back
and wait for the good news.

99
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,310
Very well, if you please...

100
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,610
Please defend the
peace of this world for us!

101
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,870
U-Um, Mister Satan? What's in the bag?

102
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:15,130
This? Let's just say this is a secret
weapon to defeat Majin Boo, just in case.

103
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,800
Oh, a secret weapon? How promising!

104
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,260
Everyone can rest assured!

105
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,260
All right, shall we start off
by talking him down, then?

106
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,270
I'm going to make him regret that
the strongest warrior in the universe,

107
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,770
Mister Satan, is here on Earth!

108
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,660
<i>That got them!</i>

109
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,670
See here! Come on out, Majin Boo!
Mister Satan has arrived!

110
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,000
What's the matter?! Huh?

111
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,800
Can't you come out, you dirty coward?
In that case, I'll come to you.

112
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,470
Prepare yourself!

113
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,810
I'm going to give it to you out-and-out,
through-and-through, and over-and-over!

114
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,690
U-Um, Mister Satan?

115
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,350
Have you strained your throat or something?

116
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:20,270
He can't hear you with that soft a voice!

117
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,690
Ahem, yeah, um, you see, it's like this...

118
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,830
I know! In that case, how about I say it for you?

119
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,290
Hey, hey, Majin Boo! Why don't you
get out here?! You're finished now!

120
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,710
You idiot!

121
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,540
If you speak in that loud a voice,
he can hear you, you know!

122
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,690
Apparently, he didn't notice.

123
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,320
Really! You guys being here is just
holding me back! Go back, go back!

124
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,910
Well then, if you'll excuse us.
Be careful! Please take care of the Earth!

125
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,030
Tell the press corps for me that I,
Mister Satan, will protect the peace!

126
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,720
Well, now that those annoyances are gone...

127
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,100
I-I wonder if Majin Boo is home.

128
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,720
Maybe he's not home...

129
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,690
He's not here!

130
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,700
Did you get scared off by me, Majin Boo?!

131
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,210
There's nothing I can do, huh?

132
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,880
After all, if he's not here,
there's no way I can fight him!

133
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,670
That's all there is to it! I'll go home!

134
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,840
Nothing I can do but go home, huh?!

135
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,010
You idiot! You tubby!

136
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,550
A fart goes "Boo," pun intended!

137
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,850
I-I-I'm so sorry, Majin Boo-<i>sama</i>!

138
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:45,310
Everything I said just now was untrue! Untrue!

139
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,520
Actually, I respect you, Boo-<i>sama,</i>
from the bottom of my heart!

140
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,030
Why, you! Startle me,
will you?! You...! You...! You...!

141
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,250
Do you think that someone as
I would be anxious about Majin Boo?!

142
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,790
Yoo-hoo!

143
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,880
Yoo-hoo!

144
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,860
W-W-Why it's Majin Boo-<i>sama</i>!
Good day to you!

145
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,620
I'm so pleased to meet you.
Yes, yes, by all means, by all means!

146
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,620
What kind of candy do you
wanna be made into and eaten?

147
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,790
Hard candy? A biscuit? A gummi?

148
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,210
No, no! Please, wait just a moment!

149
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,420
Majin Boo-<i>sama</i>, I have a
wonderful present for you!

150
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,590
H-Here! It's nothing special, but–

151
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:02,810
I don't need something that's
nothing special! I'll kill you!

152
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:06,480
N-N-No, it really isn't something
that's nothing special! See?

153
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,230
Luxurious chocolates! Be my guest!

154
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:14,230
Choco, huh? What's "luxurious?"

155
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,030
Th-That means they're
very expensive and delicious!

156
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:34,800
<i>He ate them! He ate them! You fool!</i>

157
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,300
That choco is loaded with deadly poison!

158
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,840
Soon you'll be writhing in pain and... huh?

159
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,640
Yum! This is yummier than human choco!

160
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,810
I-Is that so?

161
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,600
Ah! My next present is this! A Game Poy!

162
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,860
–What is it?
–Watch, watch! You move
like this to beat your opponent!

163
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
This is hard!!

164
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,040
L-Let's put in an easier cassette!

165
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,640
I get it. This is pretty hard too!

166
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,640
All right! Now! It's now or never!

167
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,270
Die!

168
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,360
Yea!!

169
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,110
"The End!!"

170
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,170
Hey! That was kinda fun just now!

171
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,420
W-Why that's great, great...!

172
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,550
You're funny, so I'll make you my servant.

173
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,430
Th-Thank you so much...!

174
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:13,600
I'll give you these. They're
hard candy made of people.

175
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,190
They're yummy! Here, eat them!

176
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:19,400
Y-Yes, thank you very much!
I humbly accept them!

177
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,990
Delicious! These are quite
appetizing. Most certainly!

178
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,580
What?

179
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,210
Is someone there?

180
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:42,050
I... Uh... I thought for a moment
I saw what looked like somebody...

181
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,760
Well, let's kill 'em!

182
00:18:53,810 --> 00:19:00,150
S-Splendid...! Great... that was great! Great!

183
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,950
Er, if it is all right with you,

184
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,240
could you let me take a
picture together with you?

185
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,870
Please, as a memento.

186
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,130
That's it! A little more like
...please, sprawl yourself out.

187
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,130
Like this?

188
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,010
Pardon me, but taking
pictures like this is in fashion!

189
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,980
<i>For now, at least</i>
<i>I have a nice photograph!</i>

190
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,190
Boo-<i>sama</i>! Are you feeling hungry?

191
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,020
I'm very good at cooking! Boo-<i>sama</i>!

192
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,160
It's just about time, right?

193
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,130
Goku-<i>san</i>! It's finished!

194
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,300
I got bored and fell asleep!

195
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,100
You can have a seat now.

196
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,150
Your efforts have been
appreciated, honorable forefather!

197
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,110
How about it? Gohan,
have you gotten any stronger?

198
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,280
Don't be foolish! The ceremony has just ended.

199
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,080
The power-up will take another twenty hours!

200
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,590
Let's begin.

201
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,380
Listen, it's a simple matter.

202
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:33,140
You just have to sit still
there and concentrate your mind.

203
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,930
Sit still yet again?

204
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,760
Just put up with it!

205
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,560
Just by doing this, power beyond
your limits will become yours!

206
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,140
That's a small price, isn't it?

207
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,570
There's no time, right? Let's begin right away.

208
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,820
Understood.

209
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,630
<i>The ceremony completed,</i>
<i>Gohan now enters the power-up.</i>

210
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,180
<i>Elsewhere, where Mister Satan is...</i>

211
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,350
Now, now, my delicious
cooking is ready! Help yourself!

212
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:21,980
Oh, you must be tired!
You've been working so hard!

213
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:26,150
<i>Don't get too carried away, fatso!</i>
<i>You get this straight now!</i>

214
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,520
<i>Don't you underestimate me!</i>

215
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,850
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

216
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,400
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

217
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:55,990
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

218
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:02,080
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

219
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:09,090
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

220
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:14,470
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

221
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,350
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

222
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:27,400
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

223
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,940
<i>Even now?</i>

224
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:36,580
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

225
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:42,000
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

226
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,460
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

227
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:58,510
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

228
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,280
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

229
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,330
<i>I have to say, this is unexpected.</i>

230
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,870
<i>Who'd have thought that Satan</i>
<i>and Majin Boo would become friends?</i>

231
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,580
<i>I did it! Majin Boo promised me</i>
<i>that he wouldn't kill anyone else!</i>

232
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,460
<i>I really am the world's hero, Mister Satan!</i>

233
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,630
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

234
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,010
<i>"I've Stopped Killing!!</i>
<i>Majin Boo's Good Boy Declaration."</i>

235
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:37,470
<i>Huh? Are you sure we can believe that?</i>

236
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,600
"Next time"
"I've Stopped Killing!!
Majin Boo's Good Boy Declaration"
