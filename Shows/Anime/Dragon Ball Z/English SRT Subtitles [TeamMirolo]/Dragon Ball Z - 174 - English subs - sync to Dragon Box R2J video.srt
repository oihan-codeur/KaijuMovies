19
00:02:15,205 --> 00:02:18,205
All right. Well, I'll go and gather them up.

20
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:29,505
That's two that I've found...

21
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:34,515
This is boring.

22
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:37,555
Perhaps when I said
ten days, that was too long.

23
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:43,735
<i>The opening of the tournament of</i>

25
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:18,055
Gohan, are you studying there?

26
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:20,935
Yeah. It's what Mother tells me to do.

27
00:03:20,975 --> 00:03:23,275
No matter where you are,
if you have any free time,

28
00:03:23,315 --> 00:03:25,525
do as many drills as you can, she says.

29
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,695
Yeah? That's pretty commendable.

30
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:34,705
Actually, I brought some drills myself.
I'm going to do mine, too!

31
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:38,705
Huh? You've got drills and
stuff on Planet Namek, too?

32
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:40,285
Of course we do!

33
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:45,085
You have to study if you want
to be an outstanding Dragon-type.

34
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:48,335
It's all in Namekian, so
I can't understand a thing.

35
00:03:51,085 --> 00:03:52,095
Aw, this is awful.

36
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:54,885
With you two suddenly
starting to study like this,

37
00:03:54,925 --> 00:03:57,265
it makes me look like a slacker, you know?

38
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:11,155
I think I'll go to the Kame House.

39
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:19,285
Short time left before Cell Games.

40
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,785
Has Goku gathered Dragon Balls?

41
00:04:27,165 --> 00:04:29,625
People of the world!

42
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:32,095
The combat sports champion,

43
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:37,635
Mister Satan's demonstration is about to begin!

44
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,485
Satan!

45
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:54,615
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

46
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,785
And now, our hero, Satan,
is about to enter the stadium!

47
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:31,525
Oh! Satan is pulling along
four buses all by himself!

48
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,525
What monstrous strength!

49
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:41,785
Not that man again...

50
00:05:50,085 --> 00:05:53,175
Hm? Mister Satan has produced something.

51
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:56,055
What could he be planning to do now?

52
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,595
Oh, my! They're phone books!

53
00:05:58,635 --> 00:06:01,515
What's more, he has three volumes!

54
00:06:01,555 --> 00:06:04,225
What could he be doing
with those phone books?

55
00:06:07,555 --> 00:06:09,525
D-Don't tell me...

56
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:12,815
Don't tell me he intends to tear them apart!

57
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:28,995
He did it! He's done it!

58
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,095
Er, Mister Satan,

59
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:42,465
would you tell us what your
plans are for the Cell Games?

60
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:48,935
Miserable Cell, you're going to regret this!

61
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:52,435
You will share the same fate as this bus!

62
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:57,905
Oh, as we might have expected of Mister Satan!

63
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:00,485
Satan is indeed our one star of hope!

64
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:04,495
He will definitely give Cell
an out-and-out thrashing!

65
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,005
I-I can't pull my hand out...

66
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:23,135
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

67
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:25,175
I can't watch.

68
00:07:26,515 --> 00:07:30,015
There sure are some
incredible people in this world, huh?

69
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,945
That's four that I've found!

70
00:07:59,505 --> 00:08:02,755
D-Dad, how did it go?

71
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:27,495
Huh? Two of the Dragon Balls
are together, and they're moving.

72
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:58,565
Who's there?

73
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,065
It's me.

74
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:04,775
Oh, Tao Pai Pai-<i>sensei.</i>
I've been waiting for you.

75
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:18,455
Sensei, have you brought
the goods you promised me?

76
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:21,625
Right here.

77
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:30,095
So there are Dragon Balls, which are
said to be able to grant any wish, huh?

78
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:31,895
It was hard work.

79
00:09:31,935 --> 00:09:34,515
I will let you have them for
one hundred million Zeni each.

80
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:41,275
As long as I have these,
it means that I, Vodka-<i>sama,</i>

81
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,655
the emperor of gangsters, will survive,

82
00:09:43,695 --> 00:09:46,655
even if that monster
Cell does destroy the Earth!

83
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:48,655
That is correct.

84
00:09:48,695 --> 00:09:54,575
I see. After Cell is gone, I will
place my wish with the Dragon Balls,

85
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:56,705
and create a gangster empire!

86
00:09:58,035 --> 00:10:02,005
In every age, it is the people who have
the money and the power that prosper!

87
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:07,545
So... when will you bring me
the remaining Dragon Balls?

88
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:12,475
Don't be so hasty, I will bring
them here right away, you'll see.

89
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:13,475
Is that right?

90
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:16,015
I'm counting on you, Sensei.

91
00:10:18,015 --> 00:10:21,525
<i>And here I just happened</i>
<i>to find those by accident...</i>

92
00:10:34,655 --> 00:10:37,575
It looks like they're around here.

93
00:10:50,005 --> 00:10:52,055
Who's this guy?

94
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:00,395
A D-Dragon Ball!

95
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:02,025
What?!

96
00:11:02,065 --> 00:11:04,025
They're inside here, all right.

97
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:07,065
It seems we have a pigeon
who has come right to us.

98
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:10,575
Pigeon?

99
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:12,405
Where? Where?

100
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:17,035
Let's pluck him right away.

101
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:19,415
Ahh, right you are!

102
00:11:21,455 --> 00:11:22,745
Pigeon...?

103
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:28,715
Huh?

104
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:34,135
I'm letting myself in!

105
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:43,605
Now that he's inside my mansion,
I can dish it out any way I want to!

106
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:55,405
We got him!

107
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:58,665
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

108
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,545
Huh? I broke it!

109
00:12:03,585 --> 00:12:05,795
I wonder if I've done something wrong.

110
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:28,485
W-What's the meaning of this?

111
00:12:28,525 --> 00:12:31,655
Have you been performing periodic inspections?

112
00:12:31,695 --> 00:12:33,485
Well, how about it?!

113
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:34,655
N-No!

114
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:35,945
You stupid bastards!

115
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:37,905
You've got to perform those inspections,

116
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:40,495
or they won't be of any use
when the time comes, you know!

117
00:12:40,535 --> 00:12:42,495
W-We're sorry!

118
00:12:42,535 --> 00:12:46,505
All right. We'll bring him
into this room, surprise him,

119
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:48,675
and get his Dragon Ball away from him!

120
00:12:48,715 --> 00:12:51,675
Hm? I'm getting closer.

121
00:12:56,055 --> 00:13:00,265
How nice of you to come in.
Now that you're in this room–

122
00:13:01,555 --> 00:13:05,105
Hey! Over here!

123
00:13:05,145 --> 00:13:06,645
Huh?

124
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:09,025
Over here, over here.

125
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:15,825
The Dragon Balls!

126
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:21,495
How nice of you to come in.
Now that you're in this room–

127
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,835
you'd better leave your Dragon
Ball and get out of here right now,

128
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,455
unless you want to get hurt!

129
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:34,505
If it ain't Tao Pai Pai!

130
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:35,675
What?

131
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:38,675
It's me! It's Son Goku!

132
00:13:38,715 --> 00:13:40,685
Son Goku...?

133
00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:45,265
You may have been a bad guy,
but this sure does take me back!

134
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:08,875
Aw, crap...

135
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:25,395
Where have you hidden it, eh? This pigeon...

136
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:27,065
You've brought one, haven't you?

137
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:28,395
Pigeon?

138
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,105
–Pigeon?
–Pigeon?

139
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:35,065
Don't play stupid!
The one we're going to pluck!

140
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:37,695
I don't know who you mean.

141
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:43,075
I-In any case, hand over that Dragon Ball!

142
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:44,655
What are you doing?!

143
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:48,125
Dammit...!

144
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,415
Why, you ruffian!

145
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:55,045
Whoops, I inadvertently
put too much power in that.

146
00:14:55,085 --> 00:14:56,585
Shoot him!!

147
00:15:08,145 --> 00:15:11,105
H-He's a monster!

148
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:14,985
Sorry, sorry, are you okay?

149
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:19,115
B-Boss!

150
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:20,905
D-Don't panic, you idiot!

151
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:22,785
I thought that something
like this might happen,

152
00:15:22,825 --> 00:15:24,995
and I've taken every defensive measure!

153
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,665
B-B-Boss!

154
00:15:34,705 --> 00:15:36,875
Hurry! Hurry!

155
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:40,675
Oh, you sure did it, huh?

156
00:15:40,715 --> 00:15:43,055
I'm sorry, Boss!

157
00:15:47,555 --> 00:15:49,845
Do you know what this is?!

158
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:55,985
This, see...

159
00:15:56,025 --> 00:15:58,445
...is a barrier!

160
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:02,235
No matter how strong you may be,
I doubt you can break through this barrier!

161
00:16:03,695 --> 00:16:05,195
I win!

162
00:16:17,165 --> 00:16:21,505
S-Sensei! This is where we
must call upon your strength!

163
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:25,675
N-No... I'm not feeling... so good... today...

164
00:16:25,715 --> 00:16:27,515
This is a fix, huh?

165
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:30,725
I absolutely need to have these Dragon Balls,

166
00:16:30,765 --> 00:16:34,525
but it looks like you guys are
working hard to gather them, too.

167
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:37,605
And there's nothing we
can exchange in their place.

168
00:16:39,735 --> 00:16:44,155
I know, Goku-<i>kun</i>! How about we do this?

169
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:55,875
If you can solve all three of these
puzzle rings by daybreak tomorrow,

170
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,585
we will give you these Dragon Balls.

171
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,715
If you cannot solve them,

172
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:04,595
we will take all of the
Dragon Balls that you have.

173
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:08,095
Puzzle rings, huh?

174
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:11,685
Oh! That's our Tao Pai Pai-<i>sensei</i>!

175
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:15,105
To think that you would be
hiding puzzle rings in there!

176
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:16,185
I suppose so.

177
00:17:16,225 --> 00:17:19,775
You never know when and where
something might happen, after all.

178
00:17:21,565 --> 00:17:24,735
Gotcha! I ain't ever done this,

179
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,535
but all I have to do is
solve them by morning, right?

180
00:17:26,575 --> 00:17:27,745
It's decided, then.

181
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:33,705
Henchman A-<i>kun</i>, provide
a chair for Goku-<i>kun</i> here.

182
00:17:33,745 --> 00:17:35,075
R-Right...

183
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:41,045
Here, take off your coat and relax.

184
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:52,265
All right...

185
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:55,935
Having us here watching
you must be distracting.

186
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,065
We will retire within.

187
00:17:58,105 --> 00:17:59,645
Hm? Yeah...

188
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,895
We'll leave this man here.

189
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:05,025
If you need anything at all,
please let him know.

190
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,825
Very well, then...

191
00:18:22,165 --> 00:18:23,625
Hold on...!

192
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:38,765
This sure is pretty difficult...

193
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:50,445
We should get as far away as we can, now.

194
00:18:50,485 --> 00:18:53,405
Impressive indeed, Tao Pai Pai-<i>sensei.</i>

195
00:18:57,665 --> 00:19:01,505
I've done it!

196
00:19:01,545 --> 00:19:04,045
Two more to go, huh?

197
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:20,225
This is difficult...

198
00:19:34,745 --> 00:19:37,075
You should pull that thing through there.

199
00:19:37,115 --> 00:19:42,085
Don't talk, okay? I'll be the
one who solves this. Geez...

200
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,085
O-Okay...

201
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:46,045
One more to go...

202
00:19:57,475 --> 00:19:59,435
I did it...

203
00:19:59,475 --> 00:20:01,065
I'm done!!

204
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:04,065
Congratulations!

205
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,405
Having come this far,

206
00:20:15,445 --> 00:20:18,035
it's unlikely that Son Goku
will come chasing after us.

207
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:21,625
This is all thanks to you, Sensei.

208
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,045
Huh?

209
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:28,425
Where do you suppose Boss
and the others could have gone?

210
00:20:28,465 --> 00:20:30,925
Hey, no worries.

211
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:43,435
S-Son Goku!

212
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,605
Look! I solved them.

213
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:47,985
I-Indeed you have...

214
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:51,315
Well, I'll be taking the
Dragon Balls with me now, okay?

215
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:53,485
S-Sure. Be my guest.

216
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:55,325
Thank you.

217
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:17,635
Finished at last.

218
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:40,615
I've got all seven together now!

219
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:44,535
<i>And thus, the ten days</i>
<i>passed in the blink of an eye,</i>

220
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:49,585
<i>and the Earth greeted</i>
<i>the fated day of M the 17th.</i>

221
00:21:58,505 --> 00:22:01,685
Only one hour is left until the Cell Games.

222
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:05,515
We are ready to die if necessary
in order to bring you this exclusive,

223
00:22:05,555 --> 00:22:08,685
live broadcast account of the battle with Cell.

224
00:22:08,725 --> 00:22:11,775
Cell does not move.
He has not budged an inch.

225
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:18,195
<i>Will the monster Cell be</i>
<i>the one who wins the Cell Games?</i>

226
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,075
<i>Will it be the composed Goku?</i>

227
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:21,575
<i>Or will it be...?</i>

228
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:28,415
<i>The final battle is in one hour.</i>

229
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:49,025
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

230
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:54,855
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

231
00:22:54,895 --> 00:22:57,235
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

232
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:05,705
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

233
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:12,205
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

234
00:23:12,245 --> 00:23:16,335
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

235
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:19,845
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

236
00:23:19,885 --> 00:23:22,465
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

237
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:29,975
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

238
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:34,065
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

239
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:35,905
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

240
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:39,905
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

241
00:23:39,945 --> 00:23:45,575
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

242
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:47,745
<i>So sorry.</i>

243
00:23:47,785 --> 00:23:52,875
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

244
00:23:55,625 --> 00:24:00,885
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

245
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:15,065
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

246
00:24:15,105 --> 00:24:17,815
<i>At last, it's the start of the Cell Games.</i>

247
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:19,945
<i>I'm going to be the first one to go at him.</i>

248
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:24,445
<i>Don't go making your own order,</i>
<i>and leave out the world champion,</i>

249
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:27,665
<i>Mister Satan, you bunch of amateurs!</i>

250
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:29,785
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

251
00:24:29,825 --> 00:24:33,245
<i>"Those Who Would Challenge Cell!!</i>
<i>The Curtain Rises on the Battle."</i>

252
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:38,965
<i>Huh? Is that Satan man</i>
<i>actually serious about fighting Cell?</i>

253
00:24:39,005 --> 00:24:38,965
"Next time"
"Those Who Would Challenge Cell!!
The Curtain Rises on the Battle"
