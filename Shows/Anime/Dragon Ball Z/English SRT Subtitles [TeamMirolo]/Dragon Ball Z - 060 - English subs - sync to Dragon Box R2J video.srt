00:00:12,385 --> 00:00:17,545
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:24,855
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:30,125
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,165 --> 00:00:36,865
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:43,445
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:52,315
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:55,815
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:04,825
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,295
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:14,405
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:17,805
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,845 --> 00:01:26,755
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,325
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:37,195
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,235 --> 00:01:39,135
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:54,975
<i>Bulma was all alone, guarding the Si Xing</i>
<i>Qiu Ball that had been taken from Vegeta.</i>

17
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:59,355
<i>However, the Dragon Ball</i>
<i>rolled down into the sea.</i>

18
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:36,785
<i>And then, after going to</i>
<i>great lengths to retrieve it...</i>

19
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:42,125
Where are the other Dragon Balls?

20
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:46,025
Where is Vegeta?

21
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:53,675
No matter. Once you go before Freeza<i>-sama,</i>
you'll talk, whether you want to or not.

22
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,075
F-Freeza?

23
00:02:57,115 --> 00:02:57,775
Come on!

24
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:06,145
<i>"Charge!! The Kaio-ken and</i>
<i>Kamehame-Ha of an Indomitable Spirit."</i>

25
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:12,625
Let me go! Please, let me go!

26
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:15,355
I don't even know Vegeta!

27
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:20,635
Even if you take me to Freeza,
there's nothing I can tell him!

28
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,335
Which would mean...

29
00:03:26,745 --> 00:03:30,045
I'm done for.

30
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:34,515
Thinking back, my life has
been a series of hardships...

31
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:30,035
No! No, no, no!

32
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:34,335
I don't want to die here! Let me go!

33
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,145
Hey, calm down!

34
00:05:04,045 --> 00:05:06,675
For crying out loud, what a handful she is.

35
00:05:06,715 --> 00:05:13,345
There are still some things we have
to ask you. We can't let you die so easily.

36
00:05:13,385 --> 00:05:15,945
How many times do I have
to tell you before you get it?!

37
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:19,325
I don't have anything besides that Dragon Ball!

38
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,585
We'll see.

39
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:27,625
I wonder how well you'll be able to feign
ignorance like this in front of Freeza<i>-sama.</i>

40
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:46,715
So, why is it that Freeza<i>-sama</i>
started collecting these Balls, anyhow?

41
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:51,555
Beats me. It's probably something
lower-rank soldiers like us don't need to know.

42
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:59,625
Don't you guys have the slightest
idea what the Dragon Balls are?

43
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,525
Let's go.

44
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,395
Y-You dummies.

45
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:10,365
When you get the Dragon Balls
together, something fantastic happens.

46
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:12,305
You don't say.

47
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:19,715
It's true! The Dragon Balls are
amazing things that can grant any wish!

48
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:21,445
Stop talking nonsense!

49
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,245
It isn't nonsense!

50
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:29,055
If you bring the seven Dragon Balls together,
you could have power beyond even Freeza's!

51
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:30,325
What?

52
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:37,395
I-It's true. That's why everyone
is so desperate for them, you know.

53
00:06:37,435 --> 00:06:42,335
Hey, Buleberry, we don't have
time to listen to her hogwash.

54
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:45,835
So, wouldn't it be better
if you guys left me alone,

55
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:50,215
and went off to gather the Dragon Balls?

56
00:06:52,015 --> 00:06:53,845
H-Hey!

57
00:07:00,895 --> 00:07:05,585
I-If you make a wish about
wanting to make the universe your own,

58
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,865
it could come true!

59
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,165
Let's go, Buleberry!

60
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:25,005
Sounds interesting.

61
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,175
Hey!

62
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:27,515
Now, hold on.

63
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:33,885
Freeza<i>-sama</i> would be thrilled if we
brought all seven Dragon Balls to him. Besides,

64
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:38,885
if what she says is true, then we
could become rulers of the universe!

65
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,225
T-That's right! That would
be the best thing to do.

66
00:07:42,265 --> 00:07:46,895
Come on, let's go where
the other Dragon Balls are.

67
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:51,505
I-I don't know where they are!
Y-You guys go look for them on your own!

68
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:56,175
I see. You're saying you want to
meet a painful fate here, do you?

69
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:58,875
No! Help!

70
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:03,685
Now, where are they?

71
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:08,285
T-The sea! They're submerged beneath the sea!

72
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:12,025
Is that right? That's where they are, huh?

73
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,625
Let's go, Raasberry.

74
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:20,295
What choice do I have?

75
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:09,485
<i>Kaio-ken</i>!!

76
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:35,975
All right!

77
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:56,655
Here goes!

78
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,165
<i>Ka...</i>

79
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:03,135
<i>me...</i>

80
00:10:03,175 --> 00:10:07,505
<i>...hame-Ha</i>!!

81
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:13,805
Yikes!

82
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:49,845
Whoo, that was close, that was close!

83
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:53,345
But it looks like my body is
pretty much able to take it now.

84
00:11:08,575 --> 00:11:09,735
Yow!

85
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:13,545
Hey...

86
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:20,075
J-Just a minute, here!
Hey, what are you planning to do?!

87
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:25,885
We're going to have you lead
us to where the Dragon Balls are.

88
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:31,555
Y-You've got to be kidding me!
I can't accompany you guys into that sea!

89
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:33,325
Just come along.

90
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:42,275
Listen, I won't run away!
I can't breathe underwater! Honest!

91
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:01,985
You knew?

92
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,665
Once they realize there
aren't any Dragon Balls anywhere,

93
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:19,935
they'll kill me for sure.

94
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,575
Get going!

95
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:23,845
I know–!

96
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:28,345
I'm going! I'm going, okay?!

97
00:12:49,575 --> 00:12:52,605
I don't have anything like a weapon installed.

98
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,515
The most that I have are flares.

99
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:08,145
Where are the Balls?!

100
00:13:10,265 --> 00:13:12,225
At this point, it's time to get desperate.

101
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:15,195
I remember! It's a little bit farther that way.

102
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:34,115
<i>Is this where?</i>

103
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:51,205
That's it. If I can lure those guys in there...

104
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:55,865
In there! In there!

105
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:58,235
Go on in there!

106
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:02,645
In there, okay?

107
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:09,545
J-Just a minute! What are you doing?!

108
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:33,405
This is certain to be the place where I die.

109
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:44,915
J-Just... just a minute! See? Over there!

110
00:14:44,955 --> 00:14:48,325
See? They're over there! Over there!

111
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,165
Are those?

112
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:06,565
That's them! That's them!

113
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,635
They're over there, aren't they?

114
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:13,745
You should hurry along, too.

115
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:16,845
He's going to have them all to himself. Go on!

116
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:41,235
The more the better, you know!
Hurry up and take them.

117
00:16:04,565 --> 00:16:05,595
Nice!

118
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,035
I'm blinded!

119
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:07,225
You take it from here,
if you please, Monster<i>-san.</i>

120
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:30,645
What kind of guys are these?! I'm done for now!

121
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,175
I've had it!

122
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:14,525
Good grief, you've got to be
kidding me, making me work this hard!

123
00:19:20,565 --> 00:19:22,555
No way!

124
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:32,565
Wah! Kuririn! Hurry up and come back!

125
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:43,745
It's been nearly four days. Is it still far?

126
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:49,755
Yeah, a little farther. Dammit,
Grand Elder<i>-san</i> is going to be dead.

127
00:19:53,565 --> 00:19:54,425
All right...

128
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:58,525
How about we try drastically raising our pace?

129
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:02,265
As far away as we've come,
there's no way Vegeta will know.

130
00:20:02,305 --> 00:20:07,535
Y-You're right. Besides,
Father will be here really soon.

131
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:10,205
That settles it, that settles it.
Let's fly at full speed!

132
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:10,975
Right.

133
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,235
Go!

134
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:18,545
If we fly at this speed,
we'll arrive in an hour.

135
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,255
Right!

136
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:30,895
I've found you at last!

137
00:20:30,935 --> 00:20:35,895
There are two presences– Kakarrot's son,
and the runt who was with him.

138
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:40,205
Though I thought they would be
coming here, after my Dragon Balls,

139
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:42,765
but they're somewhere pretty far away.

140
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:46,905
I don't know what they're planning,
but if I let this opportunity pass,

141
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,145
I probably won't have another
chance to force the location...

142
00:20:49,185 --> 00:20:51,785
...of the last remaining Dragon
Ball that they have out of them.

143
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:54,985
If I take this one with me,

144
00:20:55,025 --> 00:20:57,255
then even if that woman does seek this place out

145
00:20:57,295 --> 00:21:01,495
with her unusual little device,
she won't be able to get all seven.

146
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:03,155
All right!

147
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:07,195
You're going to pay this
time for sure! Brace yourselves!

148
00:21:12,545 --> 00:21:13,705
Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

149
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:18,845
We just received a message
from the Ginyu Special Corps.

150
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:22,175
They said that they are currently
passing through the area near 9035-XY,

151
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:24,845
and that they would be arriving shortly.

152
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:26,215
Very well.

153
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:30,155
They are finally arriving, are they?

154
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:33,525
Seeing as how, fortunately,
nothing has happened,

155
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:38,865
it would appear that Vegeta has been
unable to get all seven Dragon Balls together.

156
00:21:38,905 --> 00:21:44,205
Remember this well: Once I get the Scouters
the Ginyu Special Corps will be bringing,

157
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:47,735
I will be able to find you,
no matter where you are.

158
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:20,565
<i>Exactly what sort of men are in this Ginyu</i>
<i>Special Corps, who would be arriving shortly?</i>

159
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:25,245
<i>And with Vegeta having finally</i>
<i>discovered Kuririn and Gohan,</i>

160
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:29,085
<i>is there any way for</i>
<i>them to get out of this crisis?</i>

161
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:48,565
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

162
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:54,405
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

163
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:56,775
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

164
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:05,285
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

165
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:11,785
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

166
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:15,855
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

167
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:19,365
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

168
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:22,035
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

169
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:29,545
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

170
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,645
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

171
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,445
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

172
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:39,485
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

173
00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:45,155
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

174
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:47,325
<i>So sorry.</i>

175
00:23:47,365 --> 00:23:52,425
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

176
00:23:55,205 --> 00:24:00,435
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

177
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:14,115
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

178
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:17,055
<i>A giant, mysterious force is</i>
<i>approaching Planet Namek!</i>

179
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:19,485
<i>Hurry up and give me the Dragon Balls!</i>

180
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:22,155
<i>The Ginyu Special Corps that</i>
<i>Freeza has called are as strong as me–</i>

181
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:26,125
<i>no, maybe even stronger!</i>
<i>And there are five of them!</i>

182
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:27,995
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

183
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:31,705
<i>"The Great Battle Approaches!</i>
<i>The Ginyu Special Corps Now Takes the Stage!!"</i>

184
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:34,505
<i>Father! Hurry! Hurry!</i>

185
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:38,075
"Next time"
"The Great Battle Approaches!
The Ginyu Special Corps Now Takes the Stage!!"
