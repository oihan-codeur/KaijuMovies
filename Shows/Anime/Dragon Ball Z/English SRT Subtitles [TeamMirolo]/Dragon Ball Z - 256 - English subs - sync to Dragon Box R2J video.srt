<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,190
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,820
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,840
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

<i>Boo's fury had given birth</i>
<i>to another, evil Majin Boo.</i>

24
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,570
<i>There were two Majin Boos–the battling,</i>
<i>evil Majin Boo and the original Boo!</i>

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,280
I-I'll turn you into chocolate!

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,200
<i>Boo transformed yet again, and a</i>
<i>purely evil Majin Boo had appeared!</i>

27
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,170
Ah, hell!

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,220
This Majin Boo is able to seek out our <i>ki</i>!

29
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,690
<i>Is there indeed anything that can be done?</i>

30
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,540
<i>"A No-Timeout Catastrophe!!</i>
<i>Earth's Humanity Exterminated."</i>

31
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,520
W-Who the hell is that?!

32
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,820
This is the transformed Boo?

33
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,740
I knew it. Here you are.

34
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,540
<i>W-We'll be killed!</i>

35
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,090
W-What an incredible <i>ki</i>!

36
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,150
Gimme!

37
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,190
Gimme!!

38
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,710
Gimme? What the hell do
you want us to give you? Tell us!

39
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,640
Gimme the guy who will fight me.
He promised that guy would fight me.

40
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,100
I want to do it now and kill him.

41
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:28,690
He has to be here. I know
there's a great power here.

42
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,110
It's the only place he could be.

43
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:40,290
H-He's become able to seek
out <i>ki</i> after all. Th-This is bad!

44
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,120
What was that voice just now?!

45
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,870
W-Who's here makin' that loud-voiced ruckus?

46
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,640
What?! Who is that?!

47
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,470
Gimme the guy I'm going to fight.

48
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,520
That guy whose hair turns
golden made me a promise.

49
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,150
Those who you're looking for are
sure to appear in three–no, two days!

50
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,660
So until then, don't do anything, just wait!

51
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,950
Are those guys strong?

52
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,420
Stop killing people for no reason!

53
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,230
–Gimme.
–W-Wait!

54
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,570
To be sure, those two are here.
But right now, they are sleeping.

55
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,470
Wake them, we'll fight!

56
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,120
Th-They just barely went to sleep!

57
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,700
Let them sleep a little
while longer! I beg you!

58
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,670
They still aren't at their full power yet!

59
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,420
And as long as you're going to fight,

60
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,300
you'll want to go against
warriors at their full power, right?

61
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,690
It's just no good. I hate waiting!

62
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,900
Th-The promise was for two days
afterward. There's still another day!

63
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:39,950
I've changed my mind.
My mind changes fast. Gimme!

64
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,040
He's come to fight Trunks and Goten!

65
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,420
He's gotta be kiddin'! Who's
gonna let somethin' like that happen?!

66
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,420
I'm gonna go shoo that guy away!

67
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,050
W-Wait! Chichi, if you head on out there,

68
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,140
he ain't the kind of foe
you can do nothin' about!

69
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,060
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go, I tell you!

70
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,690
Let me go! Pa, let go of me! Let me go!

71
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,360
Chichi!

72
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,440
Gimme the strong guy!

73
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,290
<i>If I let Goten and Trunks fight now, there's</i>
<i>absolutely no chance of them winning.</i>

74
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,710
<i>Somehow, I have to buy us some time.</i>

75
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,880
Gimme the strong guy!

76
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:39,010
Please! Wait just a moment!
Just a little while more will be fine!

77
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:51,190
Th-That's right! You said you were
going to kill every Earthling, didn't you?

78
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,490
There's still a great deal
of people who are still alive!

79
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,670
You can fight after you're
done with that, can't you?

80
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,740
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

81
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:04,870
<i>S-Sorry, those of you people still remaining!</i>

82
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,080
<i>We'll be sure to bring you</i>
<i>back to life with the Dragon Balls!</i>

83
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,880
W-What's this?

84
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:57,840
<i>So that's it! He's looking over</i>
<i>the condition of the lower realm!</i>

85
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,500
<i>Is he thinking of taking off</i>
<i>to kill those remaining people?</i>

86
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,850
Still, at least it will buy us some time!

87
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,230
What is he walking around for?!
He thinks he's so great!

88
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,270
Kuririn...

89
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:24,610
go wake up Trunks and Goten right now
and take them to the Room of Spirit and Time.

90
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,780
They'll train in there.

91
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,580
In that place, they can do a
lot of training in a short time.

92
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,000
Eh? Why don't you let them fight right away?

93
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,710
Because I wasn't aware of that guy's power.

94
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,750
In his state, there's no way that the little
squirts could beat him, even with Fusion.

95
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,770
Tell those half-pints that if they don't
want to die while they're still little scamps,

96
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,940
then to train for all they're worth in there.

97
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,650
Okay!

98
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,000
Now's my chance! I'm gonna
push him over the side!

99
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,000
See here, Chichi! Stop it!

100
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,500
–Y-You dummy!
–I am Chichi!

101
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,670
Chichi-<i>san</i>!

102
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,010
Hey, you! Wait there!

103
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,640
Chichi-<i>san</i>!

104
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,260
I'll kill you!

105
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,780
Chichi! Are you okay?

106
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,490
Goten-<i>chan</i>... Goten-<i>chan</i> must
not be allowed to fight him! Pa!

107
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,640
What's this? He sure is a strange one, huh?

108
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,310
I'm afraid!

109
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,070
Wake up! Wake up, I say! Wake up!

110
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,660
Hey! Wake up!

111
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
I can't eat any more...

112
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,660
This is no time for you to be talking
in your sleep! Wake up! Wake up!

113
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,770
G-Gone all the way around...

114
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,650
Why?

115
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,920
What is this?!

116
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,190
Wow, how pretty!

117
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,780
What is it?

118
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,590
What's the matter, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?

119
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,600
J-Just now, on Earth,
there's something happening.

120
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,590
What is this? What's going on?!

121
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,680
Ten-<i>san</i>!

122
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,600
Chaozu!

123
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,730
F-Forgive me, you people. I will surely
bring you back to life with the Dragon Balls!

124
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:37,570
I've killed all the Earthlings.
Now, I will fight. Gimme that guy!

125
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:45,490
Understood! But we have to prepare
for the fight. Give me some time!

126
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:49,460
Two hours–no, just one hour will be fine!

127
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,750
Please!

128
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,170
One hour? How long is that?

129
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,760
Once all the sand in this sandglass has fallen.

130
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,730
No!!

131
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,740
Why not?! Why can't
you wait for just an hour?!

132
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,070
Goten-<i>kun</i> and him aren't
going to run away or anything!

133
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,610
You're a smart-aleck!

134
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:30,040
Hold it! That girl is Mister Satan's child!

135
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,040
Mister Satan's child
says she wants you to wait!

136
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,100
It's true. Her smell is similar to Satan.

137
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,020
All right, I'll wait for you.
When time is up, I'll kill everyone!

138
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,140
I'll even kill Satan's child!

139
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:16,080
Th-That was close!

140
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,840
What is happening up in the heavenly realm?

141
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,430
It's strange. Fireworks at a time like this?

142
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,620
Y-You're awake?! Go to the Room
of Spirit and Time right now and train!

143
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,510
W-What's happened?

144
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:13,140
The people of Earth... have just
about all... been exterminated.

145
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,480
By Boo?! But there was still
a good deal remaining, right?

146
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,610
No... The Earth itself
remains largely unharmed.

147
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,940
I don't understand. Why is this happening?

148
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,110
Kaioshin-<i>sama...</i>

149
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,490
A-Aren't you done yet? It's well past
time we should be finished, isn't it?

150
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:38,120
Oh, is it that time already? Yes, it
is time we should be finished, huh?

151
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,630
Hoo! The fact that we aren't done yet

152
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,670
means that you must have
incredible dormant capacities!

153
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,590
Would you please cut this out?!

154
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,620
There's no way I'm going to be able

155
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,910
to beat Majin Boo with all
this... nonsense... of yours...

156
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:33,050
W-What was that? That power
that just seemed to boil up?

157
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,060
W-Was that me?

158
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,520
Hurry up and sit down!

159
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,600
If you keep fooling around,
we'll lose that much more time!

160
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,400
I-I'm sorry about that!

161
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,700
Really, I am...

162
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,590
A-Awesome! He really
ain't any ordinary old geezer!

163
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,550
Y-Yes! He's the Kaioshin from
15 generations before me, after all!

164
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,010
For what that's worth...

165
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,050
Dormant capacities are really one's
true power that's hidden away, right?

166
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:16,060
That's what I believe.

167
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,600
That couldn't be! Just how much
power does Gohan have hidden away?!

168
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,650
This is great! Gohan is one extraordinary guy!

169
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,790
<i>Majin Boo has transformed</i>
<i>into the ultimate evil.</i>

170
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,510
<i>Goten and Trunks begin training anew.</i>

171
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,120
<i>And the elderly Kaioshin's training was for real.</i>

172
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,500
<i>Will Gohan's hidden power be fully realized?</i>

173
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,580
<i>The battle with Majin Boo draws closer.</i>

174
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,930
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

175
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,520
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

176
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:56,070
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

177
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:02,200
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

178
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,170
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

179
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,550
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

180
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,430
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

181
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:27,480
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

182
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,060
<i>Even now?</i>

183
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:36,700
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

184
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:42,080
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

185
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:48,580
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

186
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:58,590
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

187
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,690
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

188
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:18,320
<i>Oh? Is Piccolo planning</i>
<i>to have Goten and Trunks</i>

189
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,200
<i>fight inside the Room of Spirit and Time?</i>

190
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,700
<i>If they fight in there,</i>
<i>then even if they do get killed,</i>

191
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,330
<i>by destroying the entrance,</i>

192
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,250
<i>Majin Boo will never be able to come out again.</i>

193
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:30,250
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

194
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,750
<i>"The Special Training Is a Success!!</i>
<i>You're Finished Now, Majin Boo."</i>

195
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,170
<i>All right, the little guys are ready.</i>

196
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,920
"Next time"
"The Special Training Is a Success!!
You're Finished Now, Majin Boo"
<i>The battle is about to begin!</i>
