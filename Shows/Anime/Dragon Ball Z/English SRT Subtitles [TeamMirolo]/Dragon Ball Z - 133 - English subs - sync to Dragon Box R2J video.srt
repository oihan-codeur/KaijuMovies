<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,030
Doctor Gero...

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,030
<i>W-What's this?</i>

18
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,230
<i>The Artificial Human No. 20's true identity...</i>

19
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:35,140
<i>...is that of the maniacal Red</i>
<i>Ribbon scientist Doctor Gero himself?!</i>

20
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,250
<i>With Trunks traveling through time once again,</i>

21
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:51,820
<i>we learn that the Artificial Humans</i>
<i>responsible for turning the future world...</i>

22
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,090
<i>...into a hellish existence were No. 17 and No. 18.</i>

23
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,770
<i>"And the Terror Becomes Reality...</i>
<i>No. 17 and No. 18 Awaken."</i>

24
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,060
<i>What an utterly self-centered know-nothing!</i>

25
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,630
I get you. All we have to
do then is get there first,

26
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:39,270
and then destroy No. 17 and No. 18 before
Doctor Gero has a chance to activate them.

27
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,870
I wouldn't do such a cowardly thing.

28
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:46,840
I just want to be first in line to put
the others away with my own two hands!

29
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,180
The Artificial Humans we just took
on gave us such a poor fight, after all.

30
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,520
You must not. You underestimate
the Artificial Humans.

31
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,220
As Piccolo<i>-san</i> said, we should
destroy them before they are started up.

32
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,230
<i>What foolishness! I have</i>
<i>to find a way to stop this.</i>

33
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,070
<i>Until Goku-san returns to us...</i>

34
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,030
<i>I am the Prince of the Saiyans!</i>

35
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:15,640
<i>I will not be placed on the same level</i>
<i>as that lower-class warrior Kakarrot!</i>

36
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,240
<i>It is I who am the Super</i>
<i>Saiyan among Super Saiyans!</i>

37
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,080
<i>Be they No. 17, No. 18, or anything</i>
<i>else, I'll turn them to scrap quickly!</i>

38
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,290
It's already too late! You will all be killed!

39
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,750
T-This is my first time against anyone
like this–against anyone this strange!

40
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:45,660
Goku<i>-sa</i>! Goku<i>-sa</i>!

41
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,270
Goku! Hang on, Goku!

42
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,270
Goku<i>-sa</i>, are you all right?
Get a hold of yourself, Goku<i>-sa</i>!

43
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,670
He must be havin' a pretty terrifyin' dream.

44
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,860
Goku, I beg you, please get better soon!

45
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,230
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

46
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,700
How much farther is this Metro North?

47
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,680
We should nearly be there.

48
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,680
I see it!

49
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,120
What about Vegeta?

50
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,820
If we don't find the
laboratory before Vegeta does,

51
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,260
things are going to get really bad.

52
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,410
How long were you
planning on watching over me?

53
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,410
Get lost! You're annoying me.

54
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,850
I can't do that.

55
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,650
You want to fight with the
Artificial Humans, don't you?

56
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,050
What do you think you're going
to do once we get to the laboratory?

57
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,390
Are you planning on
destroying the Artificial Humans,

58
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,060
even if you have to fight me to do so?

59
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,060
That's probably what it will come to.
How many times must I tell you?

60
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,030
You underestimate how terrible
No. 17 and No. 18 really are.

61
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,040
Being told such a thing only makes
a pure Saiyan want to fight even more.

62
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,640
So then, where is this
laboratory of Doctor Gero's?

63
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,640
You don't understand any of this!

64
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,950
Gohan, ain't we at yer place yet?
I'm gettin' worn out.

65
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,220
What are you talking about?

66
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,360
That huge bulk of yours
is just being carried along.

67
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,620
You've got some nerve.

68
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,130
Think about what Gohan<i>-kun</i>
must be going through.

69
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:58,960
I don't really mind.

70
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,070
Yajirobe, did you hear that? How big of you!

71
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,270
Trunks, you be sure to grow
up like big brother Gohan here!

72
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,410
He'll be fine. Didn't we just
see how sharp Trunks<i>-san</i> was?

73
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:17,050
You're right, he was pretty sharp, wasn't he?

74
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,050
You sure you can believe that 'bout him?

75
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,050
I beg your pardon?!

76
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,420
How dare you speak so rudely of my son!

77
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,050
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

78
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,260
Sorry, but Yajirobe's–

79
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,800
There's no mistakin' he was your kid, Bulma,

80
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,440
but ya hafta consider he's also Vegeta's kid.

81
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,440
What's that?! Let's tell Vegeta he said that.

82
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,310
F-Forget I said that, 'kay, Bulma<i>-sama</i>?

83
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:53,280
Trunks<i>-san</i> is a good man.

84
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
He came back through time just to
warn us about the upcoming danger.

85
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,420
That's right! Leave it to
Gohan to come up with that.

86
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,020
He still has a mean look about him, though.

87
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,660
And that's just what we'll
relay to your father, Trunks!

88
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,800
Please stop kiddin' 'round, Bulma<i>-sama</i>!

89
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,940
If Trunks<i>-san</i> hadn't warned us ahead of time,

90
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,200
we wouldn't have known
about Father's illness...

91
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,040
...or about the Artificial Humans, or any of this.

92
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,440
On top of that, he prepared that medicine.

93
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,050
He really is a bright, considerate young man.

94
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:30,050
I sure hope Father is taking
his medicine and getting better.

95
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,390
Of course he's getting better!

96
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,390
Yeah, you're right. I'm going to speed up some!

97
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,230
W-W-Waitaminnit!

98
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,030
She said Doctor Gero's laboratory was
in a cave around here somewhere, right?

99
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,670
It sure is cold here in the north.

100
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,840
You think we can find it?

101
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,340
There are nothing but mountains all around us.

102
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:56,240
What's more, he may be able to sense our <i>ki,</i>

103
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:59,210
but there's no way we can feel out his <i>ki.</i>

104
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,420
We'll have to split up and search.

105
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,350
Whichever one of us finds
it first will signal the others.

106
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,990
So, what kind of signal should we use?

107
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:09,360
Suddenly raise your <i>ki.</i>
We'll know what you mean.

108
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,090
Indeed.

109
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,940
It's so cold! We should have dressed warmer!

110
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,940
Live with it! I'm cold too, you know.

111
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,670
How inconvenient for you Earthlings.

112
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,580
If we don't act fast, No. 17
and No.18 will be started up!

113
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,850
All right. Let's split up and find it.

114
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,420
Our future as Earthlings depends on it.

115
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,620
Hold on!

116
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,620
What, so you can tell us
how cold you are again?

117
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,420
T-That's not it!

118
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,960
I was just thinking of dividing
up the remaining senzu among us.

119
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,990
That's right! They'll be helpful.

120
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,900
There are six of them left, here.

121
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,970
There are three of us, and
since three times two is six,

122
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,200
we each get two.

123
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,440
I sure would like to take care of
all this without having to use these.

124
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,390
So, they're here, all right.

125
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,960
But they won't find my laboratory so easily!

126
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,090
Just keep prowling around!
I'll kill you all soon enough!

127
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,100
I mistook ya fer some game! You okay?

128
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,110
Good golly!

129
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,860
What's the matter?

130
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,870
There was this nutty old man...

131
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,360
That's Doctor Gero! Which way did he go?

132
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,970
Thattaway.

133
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:03,970
All right!

134
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,070
Hey! Don't leave me here like this!

135
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,650
<i>I thought this was supposed</i>
<i>to be a "No Trespassing" area.</i>

136
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,840
This way!

137
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,670
Kuririn!

138
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,970
This is terrible...

139
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,270
This must have been done by Doctor Gero.

140
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,900
That way!

141
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,530
Meddlesome insect!

142
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,560
Your level of energy will be
of absolutely no use to me.

143
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,100
Dammit! Mock me, will you?!

144
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,940
I'll crush you once and for all!

145
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,920
Piccolo?

146
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,090
There's no need for me to
dirty my hands at this point.

147
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,090
You get to live a little while longer.
Consider yourself fortunate.

148
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,530
It's just a matter of time now.

149
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,980
I-I have to let the others know...

150
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,980
<i>But first, I have to locate the laboratory!</i>

151
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,890
Here it is! I finally made it back!

152
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,120
I-I found it!

153
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,750
I found it! Now to inform the others!

154
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,860
He intends to call his friends, does he?

155
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,100
Well he's too late. Time is on my side now.

156
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,950
I have to hurry and call everyone.

157
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,360
Everyone, come quick!

158
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,730
He found it?

159
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,600
What's with this <i>ki</i>?

160
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,300
If there were another way,
I wouldn't think of activating these two.

161
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,470
But at this point, I have no choice.

162
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:28,640
I hope they're back in order...

163
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,340
So, have you awakened, No. 17?

164
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,150
Good morning, Doctor Gero<i>-sama.</i>

165
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,150
Cordiality towards me?

166
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,890
Of course. You are my creator, after all.

167
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,160
<i>Looks like he's in good working order all right.</i>

168
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,900
Now, for No. 18...

169
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,530
Good Morning, Doctor Gero<i>-sama.</i>

170
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,370
Oh! Even you greet me so cordially.

171
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,170
It is only natural.

172
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,810
<i>Apparently they're both working properly.</i>

173
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,180
I see you have also become an Artificial Human.

174
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,180
I wanted eternal life as well, you know.

175
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,180
Frankly, I'm a bit relieved.

176
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,820
What with most of your parts being
hooked in to an eternal energy source,

177
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,220
and having so much power at your disposal,

178
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,090
it was hard for you to keep control,

179
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:32,090
and you would not accept
any of my commands until now.

180
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:36,830
From now on, I will
have you do as I command.

181
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,070
Now, I have to put you to work right away.

182
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:43,070
Very soon, some friends
of Son Goku will arrive.

183
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,070
Deal with them all, and
spare no one. Understood?

184
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,740
–Yes.
–We understand.

185
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,790
That's Doctor Gero's laboratory.

186
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,190
Kuririn, nice work finding it!

187
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:03,190
I guess so.

188
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,200
We've done it. We can take care
of them before he comes back.

189
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,930
Great!

190
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,140
Yeah, well, about that...

191
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,940
What's wrong, Kuririn?

192
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,210
Doctor Gero already has returned.

193
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,910
What?!

194
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:23,140
S-Sorry.

195
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,480
You should have said so sooner!

196
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,510
What can we do if we're too late?!

197
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,490
They're here! Those fearless, contemptible fools!

198
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:39,870
So, you guys are on.

199
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,170
This door is awfully strong.

200
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,810
Stand aside. I'll destroy it.

201
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,980
Nice of you to find this!

202
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,790
Beat them all to a pulp!

203
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,090
No. 17! What's this?!

204
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:17,370
This is your Controller, used to execute
an emergency interrupt on us, isn't it?

205
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,200
Just in case anything were to happen.

206
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,340
I have no use for such a thing.

207
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,180
Why you–what do you think
you're doing?! Is this a joke?

208
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,350
You think we're going to let you
put us to sleep again, you old geezer?

209
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,060
Destroy the Artificial Humans,
and you'll pay for it!

210
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,700
That cannot be allowed!

211
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,070
You do not understand how terrifying
these Artificial Humans really are!

212
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:57,070
You shut up!

213
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:03,110
No. 17! Stop kidding around and destroy
our enemies on the other side of that door!

214
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:11,090
T-The Artificial Humans
have already been activated!

215
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,690
Out of the way, you jackasses!

216
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,220
You must not!

217
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,090
We should get out of here right now!

218
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,400
Please, wait until Son Goku<i>-san</i>
is back on his feet! After that–

219
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,370
That won't be necessary!

220
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:03,400
A scarf around the neck...
of a young man with long black hair.

221
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,740
That's No. 17.

222
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:08,910
No. 18 is a cute female type.

223
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:13,080
Trunks, they're just as you
described, unmistakably so, right?

224
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,720
R-Right.

225
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,720
<i>At last, the Artificial Humans</i>
<i>No. 17 and No. 18 are awakened.</i>

226
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,720
<i>At first look, they do not</i>
<i>appear to be too imposing.</i>

227
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,760
<i>Can they really be the mighty</i>
<i>foes that Trunks says they are?</i>

228
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

229
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

230
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

231
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

232
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

233
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

234
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

235
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

236
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

237
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

238
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

239
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

240
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

241
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

242
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

243
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

244
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,270
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

245
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:19,110
<i>No. 16? Trunks, who is</i>
<i>that huge Artificial Human?</i>

246
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,940
<i>Stop, No. 17! Do not start him up!</i>

247
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,710
<i>Do you want to destroy the world as we know it?!</i>

248
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,580
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

249
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,390
<i>"Too Late to Do Anything!?</i>
<i>The Ultimate Weapons to Kill Goku."</i>

250
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:34,760
<i>I won't let you add any more Artificial Humans!</i>

251
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,220
"Next time"
