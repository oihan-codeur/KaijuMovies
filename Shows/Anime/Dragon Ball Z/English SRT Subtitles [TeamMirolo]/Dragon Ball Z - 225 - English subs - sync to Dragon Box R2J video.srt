1
00:00:20,465 --> 00:00:24,675
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:30,265
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,685 --> 00:00:36,025
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:41,655
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:48,905
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:54,665
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:57,255
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,295 --> 00:01:00,175
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:03,005
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:05,595
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,635 --> 00:01:08,595
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:11,595
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:14,265
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:20,145
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:23,025
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,615
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:28,615
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,955
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:34,165
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,205 --> 00:01:36,995
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:39,795
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,835 --> 00:01:46,095
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:51,805 --> 00:01:57,015
<i>In order to revive Majin Boo,</i>
<i>who was sealed up by Kaioshin,</i>

24
00:01:57,055 --> 00:02:02,645
<i>Madoshi Babidi has come</i>
<i>to Earth to gather energy.</i>

25
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:09,785
<i>Goku and the others, who</i>
<i>have entered Babidi's spaceship,</i>

26
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,825
<i>have broken through his</i>
<i>prepared Stages one after another!</i>

27
00:02:38,185 --> 00:02:41,685
I will go to Stage 3 for you!

28
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:45,695
<i>Dabura has volunteered for the third Stage,</i>

29
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:51,535
<i>and confines himself to a</i>
<i>meditation chamber to heighten his ki.</i>

30
00:02:56,535 --> 00:03:00,955
Good, Dabura! Raise that <i>ki</i> even higher! More!

31
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:04,715
<i>Elsewhere, at the Tenkaichi Tournament,</i>

32
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:09,795
<i>a Battle Royale among the</i>
<i>five people left had commenced.</i>

33
00:03:15,135 --> 00:03:19,105
<i>Who will it be that survives to the end?</i>

34
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:22,895
<i>Goten and Trunks' Mighty Mask?</i>

35
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,775
<i>No. 18?</i>

36
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:29,735
<i>For that matter, Mister Satan?</i>

37
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:43,495
<i>"Such Strong Kids!! No. 18's Close Fight!?"</i>

38
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:01,315
Still not yet? This is too long...

39
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:05,485
You don't think that since Vegeta-<i>san</i>
and Father were so overly incredible,

40
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,735
they've lost their nerve?

41
00:04:07,775 --> 00:04:12,615
Well, let's just wait them
out. There ain't any rush.

42
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,775
Terrific!

43
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:50,655
Dabura's <i>ki</i> is rising steadily! Go even higher!

44
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:54,115
Good, terribly good, Dabura!

45
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:58,535
Majin Boo's revival has now come into view!

46
00:05:16,845 --> 00:05:19,805
This is the Battle Royale, to determine
the victor of the Tenkaichi Tournament.

47
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,305
And what's this?

48
00:05:21,345 --> 00:05:23,725
Up in the sky, a terrific battle
between Contestant No. 18

49
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:27,725
and Contestant Mighty Mask is unfolding!

50
00:05:35,945 --> 00:05:37,325
Damn!

51
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:39,905
Punch! Throw a punch, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

52
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:43,865
I know! But I can't get the leverage!

53
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:55,845
Nice going, nice going!

54
00:05:55,885 --> 00:05:57,555
Of the five contestants who have entered,

55
00:05:57,595 --> 00:06:02,555
Contestant Jewel and Contestant Killa
have been eliminated by ringout!

56
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:11,235
All that remain are Contestants
No. 18 and Mighty Mask,

57
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:14,775
as well as the top contender Mister Satan!

58
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:39,385
Awesome! I've never seen anything so awesome!

59
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:42,935
Go, go, No. 18-<i>san</i>!

60
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:45,305
Keep it up, Mommy!

61
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:47,725
Blow that masked jerk away!

62
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:49,815
We're not getting many cheers, huh?

63
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,695
I guess this Mighty Mask
guy must not be too popular.

64
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:13,505
That guy's pretty good.

65
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:21,805
Y-You can't get so serious about this...!

66
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:32,105
<i>He's a strange freak.</i>

67
00:07:32,145 --> 00:07:35,945
<i>Considering the size of his body,</i>
<i>his arms and legs are pretty small.</i>

68
00:07:35,985 --> 00:07:38,695
<i>And yet he's unusually strong!</i>

69
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:51,665
No. 18-san is strong, all right!
She's way different than Killa was.

70
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:54,295
Hang in there, Trunks-<i>kun</i>!

71
00:07:54,335 --> 00:07:57,795
Goten! You haven't been
doing anything for a while now!

72
00:07:57,835 --> 00:07:59,675
Kick or something!

73
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:02,965
But I can't see so well!

74
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:05,225
This is no time to be
saying that! If this works out,

75
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:09,895
I'm willing to give you one more toy!

76
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:12,515
Really?! Yea!

77
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:16,605
Okay, I'll try it!

78
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,735
Here goes, Goten!

79
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:21,695
Yeah!

80
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:45,345
<i>Strange... I can't read his movements...</i>

81
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:47,925
Trunks-<i>kun</i>! That was some good punching!

82
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:51,725
Yep! Goten, you keep it up too! Let's go!

83
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:03,775
She's losing!

84
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:04,905
She'll be okay!

85
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:08,745
Hey! What's wrong, No. 18?!

86
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:14,085
C-Cut it out already, okay? I'm begging!

87
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,455
All right! We're winning!

88
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:17,665
Yeah!

89
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:44,195
Whoa, he's dead!

90
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:10,845
To think that I have to fight
against one of those two!

91
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:13,805
Why does this have to happen?

92
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:54,175
I have not fallen out!

93
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:11,235
Ooh, oww...

94
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:14,195
You okay, Trunks-<i>kun</i>?

95
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:17,665
That one was fierce!

96
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:21,835
Okay, let's switch! I'll be on top now!

97
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,125
Y-Yeah, that might be good.

98
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:38,135
C-Contestant Mighty Mask, do you give up?

99
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:42,565
No way!

100
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:48,235
–Oh, he's gotten back up!
–He's up, he's up!

101
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:49,865
Nice going, nice going!

102
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:54,695
Contestant Mighty Mask
is doin' pretty good, huh?

103
00:11:54,735 --> 00:11:55,785
Hmm...?

104
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:14,805
<i>His movements have changed!</i>

105
00:12:23,355 --> 00:12:25,315
Now! Go, Goten!

106
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:26,525
Yeah!

107
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:32,775
We did it!

108
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:35,485
Okay! Keep it up now!

109
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:48,795
All right! Now to finish her!

110
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,675
Th-That was close!

111
00:12:55,715 --> 00:12:58,805
It really is hard to move around like this!

112
00:12:59,975 --> 00:13:02,935
This guy really does move strangely.

113
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:06,315
Mommy! Hang in there!

114
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:08,985
Be sure you win!

115
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:15,405
All right! I'm not losing this!

116
00:13:49,935 --> 00:13:53,315
Just what you expect of the King
of the Demon Realm of Darkness!

117
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:05,955
Now we can beat those three, and
gather lots of energy to revive Majin Boo!

118
00:14:05,995 --> 00:14:09,295
It's a good thing I brought Dabura along.

119
00:14:20,015 --> 00:14:27,185
The higher he raises his evil <i>ki,</i>
the easier it is to control his heart!

120
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,575
Stay on him!

121
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,955
I'm winning this, that's for sure!

122
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:48,745
Something about the look in
No. 18-<i>san</i>'s eye has changed!

123
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:52,915
Never mind that, keep closing in on her!
I'm not giving you a toy for just that!

124
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:58,045
Oh, no you don't! You
promised me! Cheater, cheater!

125
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,305
Ah! You idiot!

126
00:15:12,025 --> 00:15:17,525
W-What an incredible battle! It's a fight worthy
of the final match of the Tenkaichi Tournament!

127
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:24,325
To be perfectly honest, I did not think that
Contestant Mighty Mask would come this far!

128
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:30,995
You have to keep your eyes forward, you know!

129
00:15:31,035 --> 00:15:32,545
I'm going on top again!

130
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:34,335
Yeah.

131
00:15:38,585 --> 00:15:42,555
M-Might you be giving up this time?

132
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,065
Contestant Mighty Mask has risen once again!

133
00:15:50,105 --> 00:15:54,895
Such tenacity, which we did not see
from him at the previous tournament!

134
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:58,485
We can no longer think of this as a Battle
Royale! This is now completely a fight between

135
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:03,995
Contestant No. 18 and Contestant Mighty Mask!

136
00:16:04,035 --> 00:16:06,365
I've had it!

137
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:09,705
I-Incredible!

138
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:15,795
Look out, Goten!

139
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:44,535
We can't win like this!

140
00:16:44,575 --> 00:16:47,955
Trunks-<i>kun</i>! Let's turn Super Saiyan!

141
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:54,295
Th-That's it! As long as we're wearing
this, no one can tell! All right! Shall we?

142
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:55,955
Yeah!

143
00:17:02,005 --> 00:17:03,885
Goten, ready?!

144
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:05,595
Okay!

145
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,685
What's this? What's happened?

146
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:21,025
What's that? He's glowing!

147
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:30,825
Any way we look at it, this
outfit is working against us.

148
00:17:30,865 --> 00:17:32,995
We have to finish this with a <i>Kiai-Ho</i> blast.

149
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,455
B-But, will she be all right?

150
00:17:36,495 --> 00:17:41,335
Relax! If we control it right, she
won't die. It's No. 18-<i>san</i>, after all!

151
00:17:45,635 --> 00:17:54,975
So that's it. Super Saiyan, huh? I've finally
realized who you are, my little gentlemen.

152
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:58,475
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, you can't hit her full blast!

153
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:00,395
I know!

154
00:18:28,045 --> 00:18:29,675
I knew it!

155
00:18:30,595 --> 00:18:31,555
I missed!

156
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:34,305
Let's go with a bigger blast!

157
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:39,975
<i>Y-You've got to be kidding! That energy blast</i>
<i>had staggering speed and destructive power!</i>

158
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:49,485
<i>Those kids, they must have unheard-of power!</i>
<i>This is bad! I have to finish this fight now!</i>

159
00:18:49,525 --> 00:18:53,115
You're going to allow me
to win now! Trunks! Goten!

160
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:56,575
W-We're found out!

161
00:19:00,035 --> 00:19:01,915
She's serious about this!

162
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:13,595
C-Contestant Mighty Mask
has been snapped apart!

163
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:17,555
Y-You idiot, Goten! Why did you run that way?

164
00:19:17,595 --> 00:19:19,565
What about you, Trunks-kun?!

165
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:24,525
Huh?! Goten! Here I am
wonderin' where you'd gone!

166
00:19:24,565 --> 00:19:26,905
Then the other one is Trunks?!

167
00:19:27,985 --> 00:19:31,945
So it was those two after all!

168
00:19:31,985 --> 00:19:34,535
W-What do we do now, Trunks-<i>kun</i>?

169
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:37,915
No choice! At this point,
we'll just have to take her on!

170
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:40,955
Let's go!

171
00:19:40,995 --> 00:19:42,585
H-Hey!

172
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:56,895
Y-You cannot fight as two people!
You are disqualified! Disqualified!

173
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:57,895
We're disqualified?!

174
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,895
Uh oh, let's get out of here!

175
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,765
Yeah.

176
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:09,855
–See here! Goten! Where are you goin'?!
–Trunks! Come back here!

177
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:36,515
What an incredible match!

178
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:37,635
However, according to the rules,

179
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:40,805
the two people fighting as
Contestant Mighty Mask are disqualified!

180
00:20:40,845 --> 00:20:45,025
And so, all that remains is
Mister Satan and Contestant No. 18!

181
00:20:45,065 --> 00:20:46,945
Whoever wins this is the victor!

182
00:20:46,985 --> 00:20:51,025
Hang in there, Mister Satan!

183
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:56,325
Mommy, good luck!

184
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:05,495
<i>W-What do I do? This time</i>
<i>for sure, I really am dead!</i>

185
00:21:22,935 --> 00:21:25,355
So late...

186
00:21:25,395 --> 00:21:28,025
I wonder if they're coming out soon...

187
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:43,415
Oh, Dabura!

188
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,385
My apologies for the delay.

189
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:00,435
<i>At last, the King of the</i>
<i>Demon Realm of Darkness,</i>

190
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:03,555
<i>has completed preparations for his attack.</i>

191
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:12,105
<i>And so, can Gohan defeat Dabura,</i>
<i>and safely break through Stage 3?</i>

192
00:22:13,395 --> 00:22:17,275
<i>And who will triumph at</i>
<i>the Tenkaichi Tournament?</i>

193
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:38,965
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

194
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:45,555
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

195
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:56,115
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

196
00:22:56,155 --> 00:23:02,245
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

197
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:09,205
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

198
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:14,585
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

199
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:18,465
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

200
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:27,555
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

201
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:29,105
<i>Even now?</i>

202
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:36,735
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

203
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:42,115
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

204
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:48,625
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

205
00:23:48,665 --> 00:23:58,625
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

206
00:24:13,815 --> 00:24:16,065
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

207
00:24:16,105 --> 00:24:20,525
<i>Aw, Gohan, you ain't been</i>
<i>training while I've been away, huh?</i>

208
00:24:20,565 --> 00:24:22,025
<i>Dabura has got you all bottled up.</i>

209
00:24:22,065 --> 00:24:25,075
<i>You think you can take me on, at your level?</i>

210
00:24:25,115 --> 00:24:27,245
<i>What kind of a weakling do you take me,</i>

211
00:24:27,285 --> 00:24:29,745
<i>the King of the Demon Realm of Darkness, for?</i>

212
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:31,705
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

213
00:24:31,745 --> 00:24:34,375
<i>"Confrontation with the Demon King!</i>
<i>It's Your Turn, Gohan!!"</i>

214
00:24:34,415 --> 00:24:37,915
<i>Rats! It's been so long, I can't find my groove!</i>

215
00:24:37,955 --> 00:24:39,755
"Next time"
"Confrontation with the Demon King!
It's Your Turn, Gohan!!"
