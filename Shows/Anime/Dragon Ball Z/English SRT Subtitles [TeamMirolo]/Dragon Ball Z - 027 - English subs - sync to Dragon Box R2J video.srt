<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,075
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,115 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,255
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,295 --> 00:00:55,765
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,805 --> 00:01:04,775
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,135
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:59,395
<i>In the face of the overwhelming</i>
<i>power boasted by the Saiyans,</i>

17
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:05,105
<i>Yamucha, Chaozu, and</i>
<i>Tenshinhan had been defeated.</i>

18
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:44,175
<i>Elsewhere, Son Goku, who had</i>
<i>finally made his way back to Kami-sama,</i>

19
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:47,575
<i>spurred Kinto Un to rush to the field of battle.</i>

20
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:50,205
Kinto Un!

21
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:08,665
<i>"Leave it to Me!</i>
<i>Gohan's Great Burst of Anger."</i>

22
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:39,635
Looks like Kakarrot has decided to lay low.

23
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:42,895
What a coward.

24
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:45,995
F-Father is not a coward!

25
00:03:46,035 --> 00:03:49,065
D-Dammit...

26
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,845
What's become of you, Goku?!

27
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:09,725
Hurry, Kinto Un!

28
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,135
Go, go, go! Go!

29
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:20,835
At this point, it looks like we'll have
to fight them with just the three of us.

30
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,305
You know what to do. Let's go with that plan.

31
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:24,835
Y-Yeah.

32
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:29,045
First, I draw his attention as much as I can.

33
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:34,385
I'll find an opening, and grab
his tail, the Saiyans' weakness.

34
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:37,285
Once his power fails, and he can't move...

35
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:40,685
I-I rush him as hard as I can.

36
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:44,025
That's right. Watch yourself!

37
00:04:48,165 --> 00:04:51,395
What are you all mumbling
about? It won't do any good.

38
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:54,635
What can you guys do against me?

39
00:04:54,675 --> 00:04:59,275
We'll show you what we can do, right now!

40
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:20,265
All right!

41
00:05:20,305 --> 00:05:22,135
Here goes!

42
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:29,975
He's started charging me all of a sudden!

43
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:36,875
<i>Keep his attention!</i>

44
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:42,875
<i>Now!</i>

45
00:05:47,325 --> 00:05:49,055
Why, you–!

46
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,895
Gohan!

47
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:55,495
We did it!

48
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,245
You fools!

49
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:15,615
I-Impossible!

50
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:22,285
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

51
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:26,795
Whoa, don't you die, now.

52
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:35,305
We still have to have you
tell us about the Dragon Balls.

53
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:39,875
I-It can't be!

54
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:44,415
Hell of a miscalculation, huh?

55
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:48,825
Did you think we would leave
our weak spot untrained forever?

56
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:55,255
That's too bad. The best
that this planet had to offer,

57
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:57,625
and this is what happens to him after one blow.

58
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:00,425
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

59
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:04,595
Shake it off! Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

60
00:07:04,635 --> 00:07:09,135
Piccolo<i>-san</i>! Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

61
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:11,575
I-It's hopeless now...

62
00:07:13,185 --> 00:07:17,445
Now then, while he has gone beddy-bye,

63
00:07:17,485 --> 00:07:20,475
I think I'll toy around with the little squirts.

64
00:07:26,325 --> 00:07:29,485
I'll start with Kakarrot's son.

65
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:34,695
Hey, you've inherited
the blood of a true Saiyan.

66
00:07:34,735 --> 00:07:38,265
You'll be able to amuse
me for a little while, right?

67
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:47,405
You know, your old man is pretty cold, huh?

68
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:50,245
Letting his own son die like this...

69
00:08:04,365 --> 00:08:08,195
Dammit, what's going on here?!
The TV isn't showing anything!

70
00:08:08,235 --> 00:08:09,695
Come on, come on, come on!

71
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:11,395
It's no use.

72
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:15,565
I'm sure that things aren't going so smoothly

73
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:18,045
that they can provide us with a TV broadcast.

74
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:22,705
Y-You don't think that everyone
has been killed already, do you?

75
00:08:22,745 --> 00:08:26,045
Don't you say anything dire like that again!

76
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:41,265
Ch-Chichi, what are you
doin', gussied up like that?

77
00:08:41,305 --> 00:08:43,735
T-Those are Lunch<i>-san</i>'s...

78
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,265
I can't take it anymore!
I'm goin' to rescue Gohan!

79
00:08:48,305 --> 00:08:52,035
D-Don't be ridiculous! If you
go now, you're goin' to be killed!

80
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:55,045
I don't care! I'm goin'
to die together with Gohan!

81
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:56,915
H-Hold on, now!

82
00:08:56,955 --> 00:09:00,285
Chichi! Calm down!

83
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:05,115
Let me go, Pa! Let me go!

84
00:09:05,155 --> 00:09:09,125
Let go of me! I-I'm goin'!

85
00:09:09,165 --> 00:09:14,295
Pa! Let go of me! I'm goin'!
I'm goin'! I'm goin'! I'm goin'!

86
00:09:14,335 --> 00:09:19,295
Now see here, Chichi!
You're goin' to get killed!

87
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:21,305
–I'm tellin' you no!
–I'm goin' to go rescue Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

88
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:23,735
–Come on, re-think this!
–I'm goin' where Gohan is!

89
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:25,605
Chichi!

90
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:29,145
<i>Tenshinhan...</i>

91
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:31,375
<i>Yamucha...</i>

92
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:37,685
<i>Son-kun...</i>

93
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,785
<i>I believe in you.</i>

94
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:45,395
<i>I'm sure... I'm sure</i>
<i>you're going to save the Earth.</i>

95
00:10:00,245 --> 00:10:05,485
Hey now, don't you snuff it
just yet! Amuse me a little longer.

96
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:30,705
That's more like it!

97
00:10:36,085 --> 00:10:37,515
Stop!

98
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:55,555
Ho, at least his moves are pretty good.

99
00:10:56,565 --> 00:11:00,265
You dirty brat! Bounce around, will you?!

100
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,215
Let me show you something I've been saving.

101
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:13,935
<i>Kienzan!</i>

102
00:12:31,995 --> 00:12:34,695
What a worthless technique!

103
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,845
Nappa! Get out of the way!

104
00:12:57,355 --> 00:13:01,525
That idiot! Can't he tell
what kind of technique that is?!

105
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:04,365
D-Damn!

106
00:13:12,005 --> 00:13:15,365
W-Why, you–!

107
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:20,545
How dare you wound my face!

108
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:31,015
Away with you!

109
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:39,795
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

110
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:48,775
Now to finish you!

111
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:18,535
Y-You bastard!

112
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:22,095
A-Are you awake already?!

113
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,945
Looks like you're having
a hard time with them, Nappa!

114
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:34,855
Don't you... don't you
look down on Earth, Saiyan!

115
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:42,925
W-W-Why, you! Now I'm mad!
I was holding back against you,

116
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,395
since we can't kill you
because of the Dragon Balls.

117
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:46,965
But don't get too full of yourself!

118
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:50,265
You're the one who's too full of himself!

119
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:54,305
W-What <i>ki</i> is this?!

120
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:58,715
T-There's an incredible <i>ki</i>
coming this way from far off!

121
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:06,615
I-It's true! A-An amazing, yet familiar <i>ki</i>!

122
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:12,385
N-No doubt about it. I can feel it.

123
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:20,795
You guys are all just
spouting nonsense! What is this?!

124
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:25,825
It could only be him. It's Son Goku!

125
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:34,975
<i>Just a little farther, Goku. Hurry! Make haste!</i>

126
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:41,285
It's Son Goku! Son Goku is coming!
I knew he was sure to come!

127
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:44,385
Damn that bastard, making us wait for him!

128
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:50,555
F-Father! Father really is coming! Hurry!

129
00:15:51,895 --> 00:15:54,295
G-Goku...

130
00:15:54,335 --> 00:15:56,865
Kakarrot?

131
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:58,335
Where is he?

132
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:09,245
These guys have the unusual
ability to sense someone's presence.

133
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:15,455
Is it Kakarrot? Let's see...

134
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:24,755
I'm close. I can feel them.
There are two enormous <i>ki,</i>

135
00:16:24,795 --> 00:16:28,825
two even more enormous <i>ki</i>, and one small <i>ki...</i>

136
00:16:28,865 --> 00:16:33,765
That number ain't right. Has somebody died?

137
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:36,935
Kinto Un, please hurry faster!

138
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:55,885
Vegeta<i>-sama</i>!

139
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:58,955
Is what these guys are saying true?

140
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:04,395
Is Kakarrot really headed this way?

141
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:07,535
I don't know whether it's Kakarrot or not,

142
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:11,345
but someone will be
here in about four minutes.

143
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:15,815
Someone with a battle power of five thousand.

144
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:22,145
Five–five thousand?! That's impossible!

145
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:24,655
<i>It's definitely a reading</i>
<i>that makes it unthinkable</i>

146
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:26,785
<i>that this is the same Kakarrot as before.</i>

147
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:30,495
<i>What's more, these guys</i>
<i>are able to alter their readings.</i>

148
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:33,465
<i>That means it's at least five thousand.</i>

149
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:39,105
T-That can't be! It must
be some kind of mistake!

150
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:43,935
It's unusual to see this guy panicked.

151
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:51,915
Nappa! Kill them! If all four of them
team up, it could be a problem for us!

152
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:54,745
It will also serve as a warning to Kakarrot!

153
00:17:54,785 --> 00:17:55,945
What?!

154
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:00,955
But what about the Dragon Balls?

155
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,625
I don't care! I have an idea.

156
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:08,025
If we go to Planet Namek,
the home world of that Namekian,

157
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:11,365
I'm sure that there will be Dragon
Balls that are even more powerful.

158
00:18:11,405 --> 00:18:14,335
I thought they were just worthless stories,

159
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:17,375
but if Kakarrot really has come back to life,

160
00:18:17,415 --> 00:18:20,975
then those legends are true after all.

161
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:27,515
I get you. But Kakarrot being five thousand
has to be a mechanical malfunction.

162
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:33,385
Well, it doesn't matter. It doesn't
change the fact that I get to kill them all.

163
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:36,595
I'll start with you!

164
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:42,065
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>, run!

165
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:45,795
I'll stop him one way or
another until Father gets here!

166
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:46,795
What?!

167
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:51,375
After all, if you die, Piccolo<i>-san,</i>
then Kami<i>-sama</i> dies too,

168
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:53,305
and the Dragon Balls will...

169
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:59,415
You're talking nonsense! There's
no way you can stop him by yourself!

170
00:19:03,555 --> 00:19:07,255
Stop me, you say? <i>Me</i>?

171
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:13,695
I-If this keeps up, there
won't be any going back...

172
00:19:14,635 --> 00:19:17,725
I-It's no use... I can't move...

173
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:26,735
Don't make me laugh, you brat!

174
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:30,275
No!

175
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:01,905
I-Incredible! D-Did he get him?

176
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:36,145
Why, you brat! This is where it ends!

177
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:48,055
N-No!

178
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:52,995
Goku...

179
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:04,905
Die!

180
00:21:19,355 --> 00:21:22,325
Who–who are you?

181
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,925
They're sour!

182
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:09,365
<i>Piccolo leaps in to rescue Gohan from his pinch.</i>

183
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:12,775
<i>What will be Piccolo's fate?</i>

184
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:15,305
<i>Hurry, Goku!</i>

185
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:48,605
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

186
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:54,485
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

187
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,855
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

188
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:05,355
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

189
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:11,835
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

190
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:15,935
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

191
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:19,435
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

192
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:22,075
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

193
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:29,555
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

194
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,685
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

195
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:35,525
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

196
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:39,555
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

197
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:45,235
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

198
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,405
<i>So sorry.</i>

199
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:52,535
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

200
00:23:55,245 --> 00:24:00,515
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

201
00:24:12,195 --> 00:24:13,825
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

202
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:15,895
<i>Sorry to keep you guys waiting!</i>

203
00:24:15,935 --> 00:24:17,735
<i>You're going to pay, you Saiyans!</i>

204
00:24:17,775 --> 00:24:20,635
<i>Ha! You just had to stroll on by, huh?</i>

205
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:23,235
<i>There's no way you can stand up to Nappa-sama–</i>

206
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:27,405
<i>Ungh! What?! T-That's impossible!</i>

207
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:29,345
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

208
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:33,045
<i>"Ferocity of the Saiyans!</i>
<i>Kami-sama and Piccolo Both Die."</i>

209
00:24:33,085 --> 00:24:35,525
<i>Father, you're incredible!</i>

210
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:38,255
"Next time"
"Ferocity of the Saiyans!
Kami<i>-sama</i> and Piccolo Both Die"
