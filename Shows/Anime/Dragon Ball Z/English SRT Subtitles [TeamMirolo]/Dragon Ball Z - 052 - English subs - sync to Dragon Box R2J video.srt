<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:43,255
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:52,145

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:38,935
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:04,045
<i>The Dragon Balls were</i>
<i>falling into devilish hands.</i>

17
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:25,485
<i>Meanwhile, Goku, while</i>
<i>on his way to Planet Namek,</i>

18
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:29,905
<i>received some unexpected good</i>
<i>news from Kaio, in the Next World.</i>

19
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:38,455
That's awesome!

20
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:42,915
You mean that each of them has arrived
there together at your place, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

21
00:02:43,915 --> 00:02:48,885
They all want even tougher
training than what you went through.

22
00:02:51,055 --> 00:02:58,515
<i>"Listen to Me, Goku! Hands Off Freeza."</i>

23
00:03:01,855 --> 00:03:04,405
Can I talk to Goku?

24
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:08,445
Place your hand on my shoulder and speak.

25
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:11,155
Yo, do you hear me, Goku?

26
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:14,995
Yeah! I'm glad to hear you're all doing okay.

27
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:18,835
Yeah, but the gravity here has us beat.

28
00:03:18,875 --> 00:03:21,835
Our bodies are so heavy,
we can barely even run.

29
00:03:21,875 --> 00:03:24,425
Yeah, I know, I know.

30
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:28,845
But I'm heading for a place called
Planet Namek, where they have Dragon Balls,

31
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:32,215
and I've started training under
even more incredible gravity than that.

32
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:35,225
I've got to get a whole lot stronger
in the next five and a half days,

33
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:37,015
or we're going to be in bad shape.

34
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:40,435
Huh? Why? Has something happened?

35
00:03:40,475 --> 00:03:43,025
I was injured really bad,

36
00:03:43,065 --> 00:03:48,115
so Kuririn, Bulma and Gohan went to
Planet Namek to search for the Dragon Balls.

37
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:52,865
But that Saiyan, Vegeta, had also gone
to Planet Namek to find the Dragon Balls.

38
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:57,785
–W-What?!
–So, did they get themselves done in by him?

39
00:03:57,825 --> 00:04:02,955
No, it appears that Vegeta still ain't
discovered Kuririn and the others yet.

40
00:04:02,995 --> 00:04:08,425
But that ain't all. There's
something even more unbelievable.

41
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:11,965
They said there are these other
strange guys who are after the Dragon Balls.

42
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:15,015
The weird thing about
them is that they were wearing

43
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,845
the exact same outfits Vegeta was.

44
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:23,395
What's more, they said that one of them
has a <i>ki</i> that's far greater than Vegeta's.

45
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:25,185
W-What?!

46
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:28,855
What? Has something happened?

47
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:34,995
E-Even greater than Vegeta, who
was too much for even Goku to handle?

48
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:39,825
B-By any chance, was his name Freeza?

49
00:04:39,865 --> 00:04:43,835
I don't know, I ain't heard,
but once I know, I'll tell you.

50
00:04:43,875 --> 00:04:48,005
<i>If it is Freeza, then</i>
<i>this is exceptionally bad...</i>

51
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:52,345
G-Goku, I'm going to
check out Planet Namek for you.

52
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:54,345
Could you, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

53
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:58,265
Let's see, which direction is Planet Namek in?

54
00:05:00,975 --> 00:05:04,395
Yamucha, tell us what's going on.

55
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:21,865
I'm definitely sensing a tremendous <i>ki.</i>
Now to find the source of this <i>ki...</i>

56
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:44,855
F-Freeza!

57
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:48,025
What, you know him, Kaio-sama?

58
00:05:48,065 --> 00:05:52,195
Goku, this foe is more than just too
much for you, he's the worst of the worst.

59
00:05:52,235 --> 00:05:55,365
There is no way you can handle this opponent.

60
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:58,365
Huh? W-What do you mean by that?

61
00:05:58,405 --> 00:06:02,745
Listen to me, Goku. This is an
order from Kaio. Do not go near him.

62
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:04,125
When you get to Planet Namek,

63
00:06:04,165 --> 00:06:07,745
take the other three aboard and
get out of there immediately. Got that?

64
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:10,755
I'm not just saying this for your own sake.

65
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,965
I'm saying this for the sake
of everyone on Earth, Namek,

66
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,755
and many other planets as well.

67
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,965
If you launch some shoddy
attack on Freeza and get him angry,

68
00:06:18,005 --> 00:06:21,225
something terrible is going to happen.

69
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:24,765
You have to leave that guy alone.

70
00:06:24,805 --> 00:06:28,355
Is he really that incredible a guy?
I'd kind of like to have a look.

71
00:06:28,395 --> 00:06:32,395
Absolutely not! Do not go
near him! Do you understand me?!

72
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:33,195
But still...

73
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:36,655
"But still" my spongy hind end!

74
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:45,785
Goku, whatever it takes, gather the
Dragon Balls, and bring us back to life.

75
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:47,375
Piccolo!

76
00:06:47,415 --> 00:06:51,125
I'm going to build myself up even more
than you did here, and go to Planet Namek.

77
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:52,715
All right!

78
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:58,135
The two of us will blow away
this ridiculous whatever-his-name-is.

79
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:03,135
Don't be absurd! You guys
don't know a thing about Freeza!

80
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:06,305
There's no time. Hurry and start training us.

81
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:09,725
If you're planning to fight
Freeza, I cannot teach you.

82
00:07:09,765 --> 00:07:13,355
Promise me that you won't go to Planet Namek.

83
00:07:14,815 --> 00:07:17,025
All right.

84
00:07:17,065 --> 00:07:21,195
You mean it, right? I'm trusting you.

85
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,825
That goes for you, too!

86
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:32,335
<i>There's no way I'm going to</i>
<i>keep a worthless promise like that.</i>

87
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:36,335
<i>I won't be able to surpass Goku</i>
<i>by doing the same training that he did.</i>

88
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,545
<i>I'll have to pick up the points of the training,</i>

89
00:07:38,585 --> 00:07:41,215
<i>and then hone the techniques on my own.</i>

90
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:50,105
All right, how about we get started?

91
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:52,685
<i>Here we go...</i>

92
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,025
<i>Let's do this...</i>

93
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:12,125
First of all...

94
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:14,915
...try to make me laugh with a pun.

95
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:18,755
I will allow anyone who
passes this test to train under me.

96
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:28,185
Even if he has told me not to mess with
him, there's no harm in getting stronger!

97
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:32,765
All right, let's try jumping
all the way to fifty-times gravity!

98
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:44,365
Hey, if we keep flying at this pace,

99
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:47,205
how long before we arrive
at the Grand Elder's place?

100
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:50,825
We should be able to
make it in another five hours.

101
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:59,675
Damn, I can't find anywhere
that has multiple powers.

102
00:08:59,715 --> 00:09:03,345
What does that mean?
Aren't there any more villages?

103
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:09,095
There are two powers moving.

104
00:09:09,135 --> 00:09:15,725
That's strange... one of them doesn't
feel like a Namekian, or one of Freeza's men.

105
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:19,355
That's disconcerting.
Maybe I should go check it out.

106
00:09:23,775 --> 00:09:27,785
<i>Meanwhile, on Kaio's World...</i>

107
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:35,125
<i>...a fierce battle of puns was unfolding.</i>

108
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:41,755
<i>Sure enough, the ones who had trouble</i>
<i>with this test were Tenshinhan and Piccolo.</i>

109
00:09:46,755 --> 00:09:48,135
I am chagrined...

110
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:50,635
Ten-<i>san</i>, hang in there!

111
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,225
Tenshinhan...

112
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:53,685
(mumble, mumble, mumble)

113
00:09:56,265 --> 00:10:00,105
And I can really make him laugh with that?

114
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:03,695
You'll be fine. This is my ace-in-the-hole gag.

115
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:05,325
It is, huh?

116
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:06,695
All right,

117
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:08,445
I'll be right back.

118
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:12,155
Ten-<i>san</i>, fight!

119
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,795
Here I go!

120
00:10:27,135 --> 00:10:28,715
Bring it on.

121
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:39,395
Here goes!

122
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:44,485
Y-You think... you think...

123
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:48,195
You think...

124
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:54,665
Ten-<i>san</i>! Hang in there!

125
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:58,455
<i>Have faith in yourself! This one</i>
<i>is definitely going to go over well!</i>

126
00:10:59,495 --> 00:11:02,085
Huh? What was that?

127
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:11,055
This is different! His determination
is different than the others up to now!

128
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,175
<i>Now!</i>

129
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:17,395
You think up your nose
is secret, but it's (s)not!!

130
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:34,445
You think up your nose
is secret, but it's (s)not!

131
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:39,165
<i>What's that? A secret up my nose?</i>

132
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:43,415
<i>I-I'm not sure I understand it,</i>
<i>but in any case, it is funny, huh?</i>

133
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:53,425
<i>W-What should I do? Should I laugh?</i>

134
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,515
I did it!

135
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,145
You did it, Tenshinhan!

136
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,565
Ten-<i>san</i>!

137
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:06,735
–You did it! You did it, Ten-<i>san</i>!
–Well done! Good for you!

138
00:12:06,775 --> 00:12:08,405
This is nonsense!

139
00:12:17,615 --> 00:12:19,575
Stop, Dende!

140
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,335
It's Vegeta! He's discovered us, all right!

141
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,545
He's coming straight
toward us at incredible speed!

142
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,175
Hide! Hurry!

143
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,505
Huh?

144
00:13:10,715 --> 00:13:14,545
W-What happened? He changed direction.

145
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:24,725
There's another large <i>ki</i> out there!
He went in that direction!

146
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:28,735
This power is Zarbon, no doubt about it.

147
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:31,565
I've been waiting for him
to move out on his own.

148
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:42,745
28...

149
00:13:42,785 --> 00:13:48,125
29...

150
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:52,585
30!

151
00:13:56,255 --> 00:14:02,435
Damn... I finally made it to 30...
That's fifty-times gravity for you...

152
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:16,865
Now then, to begin your
conditioning. I should warn you,

153
00:14:16,905 --> 00:14:21,325
my conditioning is un-<i>condition</i>-ally severe.

154
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:25,535
I just said another one!

155
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:31,295
H-Huh?

156
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:39,095
You guys want to go home?

157
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:45,895
–That's funny!
–That was funny! That was funny!

158
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:49,515
Yeah, wasn't it though? Wasn't it
though? You can laugh even more.

159
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:52,395
Laugh!

160
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:55,155
That was great! That was great!

161
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:00,445
Go ahead, laugh!

162
00:15:01,865 --> 00:15:05,075
Okay, let's get started right away.

163
00:15:09,835 --> 00:15:13,625
Hey! Bubbles-<i>kun</i>!

164
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:26,855
First of all, you are going
to catch Bubbles-<i>kun</i> here.

165
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:28,855
Oh, is that it?

166
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,435
Easy, easy.

167
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:36,275
I'm not so sure. It took even
Son Goku three weeks to do it.

168
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:37,445
Goku?!

169
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:40,285
<i>It took him three weeks?</i>

170
00:15:40,325 --> 00:15:41,285
Question!

171
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,445
What is it?

172
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:47,455
If we catch that monkey,
will you train us, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

173
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:51,335
That's wishful thinking. After
this, you have to train with Gregory.

174
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:56,085
You'll train with me after
all that is done. Understood?

175
00:15:57,795 --> 00:16:01,175
All right.

176
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:04,215
Okay, run, Bubbles-<i>kun</i>!

177
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,435
–Wait up!
–Wait up!

178
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:14,065
Wait up! Wait up!

179
00:16:15,855 --> 00:16:17,445
I'll fly.

180
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:21,065
Good luck!

181
00:16:22,865 --> 00:16:24,655
Now then...

182
00:16:34,835 --> 00:16:37,255
W-What the–?!

183
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:44,385
Is this what you call training?
This is laughable.

184
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:48,845
I don't remember giving you
permission to participate in the training!

185
00:16:55,225 --> 00:17:02,235
Hmph! I don't wish to undertake any training
under you if it undermines my own dignity.

186
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:14,795
<i>Under</i>-take any training <i>under</i> me...
if it <i>under</i>-mines your dignity...

187
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:17,205
You made a triple, did you?

188
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:24,215
Piccolo, you passed the test. I will train you.

189
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:28,635
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what are
you all standing around for?

190
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:33,055
Laugh! Laugh! That was funny!
That was funny, right?

191
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:53,075
If only I had a Scouter,
a village would be easy to find.

192
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:59,375
That's... Vegeta!

193
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:10,765
Yo, it's been quite a long
time, hasn't it, Zarbon-<i>san</i>?

194
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:16,185
I have disposed of Dodoria.
Next, it's your turn.

195
00:18:16,225 --> 00:18:17,225
What?!

196
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:21,605
Y-You disposed of Dodoria?

197
00:18:21,645 --> 00:18:24,195
Without any trouble.

198
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:25,575
Unbelievable.

199
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:30,955
You'll find out once we go at it.
You'll realize how strong I am.

200
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:35,205
Vegeta, why are you
turning against Freeza-<i>sama</i>?

201
00:18:35,245 --> 00:18:41,585
It's a simple matter.
I've never liked that Freeza bastard.

202
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,385
Up until now, I've been
pinned down by his power,

203
00:18:44,425 --> 00:18:46,595
and had no choice but to do as he said,

204
00:18:46,635 --> 00:18:51,135
but then I unexpectedly
learned that I could gain eternal life.

205
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,555
You mean the Dragon Balls.

206
00:18:53,595 --> 00:18:56,555
You think I'm about to let Freeza have them?

207
00:18:56,595 --> 00:19:02,145
Once I have obtained eternal life, my
chance to beat Freeza will come along for sure.

208
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:07,575
You fool. Do you think you can
beat Freeza-<i>sama</i> with just eternal life?

209
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:10,155
It's too bad you don't have a Scouter.

210
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:16,745
I have gained more power than you
could imagine over my many battles.

211
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,585
<i>You're</i> the one who doesn't understand.

212
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:25,125
Freeza-<i>sama</i>'s ability far
transcends even your level.

213
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,925
I'm through with all of this pointless talk!

214
00:19:27,965 --> 00:19:32,765
I heard from Dodoria that
Freeza is afraid of Saiyans.

215
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:37,605
I'm going to show you
that Saiyan power, right now!

216
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:39,605
You really are full of yourself.

217
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:43,605
What Freeza-<i>sama</i> was afraid of
was the Saiyans banding together.

218
00:19:43,645 --> 00:19:45,775
You can't do anything all by yourself.

219
00:19:45,815 --> 00:19:49,235
Well, let's see about that.

220
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,695
He deflected it!

221
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:38,825
Incredible! It's a clash of <i>ki</i> against <i>ki</i>!

222
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:42,585
Vegeta and someone else
are banging into each other!

223
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:46,545
H-His opponent is probably the
one who was at that Freeza guy's side.

224
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:51,045
T-They're both monsters. There's
no way I can square off against them.

225
00:20:51,085 --> 00:20:55,675
I hope the two of them
end up flattening each other.

226
00:20:55,715 --> 00:20:57,685
All right...

227
00:20:57,725 --> 00:20:59,685
Hold on to me tight!

228
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,185
This is our chance!

229
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:04,525
We'll hurry to the Grand Elder while
the two of them are fighting each other!

230
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:08,855
If I fly as fast as I can, we'll
get there a lot sooner! Let's go!

231
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:14,735
What's the matter?!

232
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:18,705
Zarbon-<i>sama</i>, of all people! Your movements
make you look like you're standing still!

233
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,245
Damn it!

234
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:43,645
To think that you'd be
so helpless at <i>this</i> level!

235
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:08,795
You've surprised me. You have
indeed made magnificent progress.

236
00:22:08,835 --> 00:22:10,585
But as a result,

237
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:17,175
you have awakened my true power,
which has been dormant for many years.

238
00:22:17,215 --> 00:22:21,635
<i>Zarbon's expression has suddenly changed.</i>

239
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:27,815
<i>Exactly what is this hidden,</i>
<i>fearsome power of his?</i>

240
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:47,915
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

241
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:53,795
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

242
00:22:53,835 --> 00:22:56,135
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

243
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:04,635
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

244
00:23:06,935 --> 00:23:11,145
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

245
00:23:11,185 --> 00:23:15,235
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

246
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:18,735
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

247
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:21,405
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

248
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:28,915
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

249
00:23:31,125 --> 00:23:33,005
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

250
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,795
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

251
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:38,845
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

252
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:44,515
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

253
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:46,685
<i>So sorry.</i>

254
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:51,815
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

255
00:23:54,565 --> 00:23:59,815
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

256
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:13,295
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

257
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:14,835
<i>What is this weird sensation I'm feeling?</i>

258
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,965
<i>Even as far away as I am,</i>
<i>I sense an incredible battle.</i>

259
00:24:18,005 --> 00:24:21,965
<i>Unlike Saiyans, we do not transform</i>
<i>into something unnecessarily large.</i>

260
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:25,515
<i>Our power just increases. Overwhelmingly so!</i>

261
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:27,265
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

262
00:24:27,305 --> 00:24:30,765
<i>"Nothing but Goosebumps! The Handsome</i>
<i>Warrior Zarbon's Devilish Transformation."</i>

263
00:24:30,805 --> 00:24:34,065
<i>Father, it looks like Vegeta is about to lose.</i>

264
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:37,395
"Next time"
"Nothing but Goosebumps! The Handsome
Warrior Zarbon's Devilish Transformation"
