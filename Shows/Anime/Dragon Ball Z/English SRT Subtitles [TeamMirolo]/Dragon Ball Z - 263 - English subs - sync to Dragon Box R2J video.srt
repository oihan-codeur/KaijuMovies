<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,745

<i>The ultra-power of Super Gotenks</i>

24
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:13,495
<i>However, at the moment when</i>
<i>he was about to finish him off,</i>

25
00:02:13,535 --> 00:02:18,835
<i>his Fusion dissolved, and</i>
<i>Gotenks returned to Trunks and Goten.</i>

26
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:29,135
Huh?! This is bad!
Our Fusion has come undone!

27
00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:35,895
<i>Elsewhere, in the Kaioshin Realm,</i>
<i>Gohan finally completed his power-up.</i>

28
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:50,985
I ain't gonna see you again.

29
00:02:51,025 --> 00:02:54,035
Not until you come to
the Other World, that is...

30
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:57,035
Good luck! Go blow Majin Boo away!

31
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:57,955
Fine!

32
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:19,265
All right! let's go!

33
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:29,445
<i>"Boo Overwhelmed!!</i>
<i>Gohan's Miracle Power."</i>

34
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:59,095
For them to run out of time...!

35
00:03:59,135 --> 00:04:04,225
You rotten guys! This is all because
you didn't finish him off right away!

36
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:08,235
Now we've had it! Our Fusion has ended too!

37
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:12,615
You don't suppose we're
going to get killed now?

38
00:04:12,655 --> 00:04:17,075
There's no supposing about it! We are
definitely going to be killed like this!

39
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,955
I-It can't be so...!

40
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,085
Say, shall we run away?

41
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:27,085
Do you think we could get away?

42
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:38,015
It would be impossible, wouldn't it?

43
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:43,605
We're going to get killed, are we?
Damn, and we're still so young!

44
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:45,975
I don't want to be!

45
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:56,535
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

46
00:04:56,575 --> 00:05:00,615
I don't think it will be
much help, but I'll fight too.

47
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:05,045
I'll do everything I can, and if it's
not enough, I'll die alongside you.

48
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:08,125
Do everything you can?!
You've got to be kidding!

49
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:10,125
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, you know darn well

50
00:05:10,165 --> 00:05:13,045
this is the guy not even
Fusion could stand up to!

51
00:05:13,085 --> 00:05:16,635
Right! Right! Piccolo-<i>san</i>, you're
an adult, so maybe you're fine with it,

52
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:21,645
but we're still children,
and we'd definitely hate to die!

53
00:05:21,685 --> 00:05:24,185
What should we do, Trunks-<i>kun</i>?

54
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:26,065
Okay, then...!

55
00:05:28,685 --> 00:05:30,195
Having come to this...

56
00:05:30,235 --> 00:05:32,105
Having come to this...?

57
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,035
Let's sincerely apologize!

58
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:44,535
He's pretty simple, so if we give him
one of his favorite candies and apologize,

59
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,045
he might unexpectedly forgive us!

60
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:50,915
That's it! Maybe he will forgive us!

61
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:55,005
If he does, ha ha, we can buy
enough time for our next Fusion!

62
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:58,175
N-Now, come on...

63
00:05:58,215 --> 00:06:02,765
All right, Goten! Let's get
some candy ready right now!

64
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:13,775
But there aren't any
stores anywhere around.

65
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:17,615
It's possible that we could look
throughout the entire world and there

66
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:19,195
wouldn't be any candy stores left.

67
00:06:19,235 --> 00:06:22,205
I don't think there's anyone
around who makes candy, either.

68
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:26,035
Maybe this won't work after all...

69
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:28,915
Hey! Cut it out already!

70
00:06:41,095 --> 00:06:42,595
What?!

71
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,055
W-What's the matter with Majin Boo?

72
00:06:45,095 --> 00:06:47,845
B-Beats me...

73
00:06:51,605 --> 00:06:55,645
I-I hear something!

74
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:12,255
Huh? Is that... could it be... snoring?

75
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:16,425
H-He's asleep. He fell asleep! How come?

76
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:18,135
<i>W-What does this mean?!</i>

77
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:22,055
<i>Is he just toying around with us?</i>
<i>Or is he instead...?</i>

78
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:26,435
We're going to go have a look!

79
00:07:26,475 --> 00:07:30,145
W-Wait! Don't do anything uncalled-for!

80
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:27,655
He has to be sleeping
after all, here, doesn't he?

81
00:08:27,695 --> 00:08:31,535
I'm not sure. Maybe he's just trying to trick us.

82
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:35,335
I know! Let's tug on this and see!

83
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:39,625
If he's playing possum on us, he's
sure to be surprised and open his eyes!

84
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:42,925
Here goes!

85
00:08:47,715 --> 00:08:48,935
A little farther...

86
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:49,935
What?!

87
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:57,105
Y-You idiots! Goten! Trunks!

88
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,105
W-What are you guys trying to do,

89
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:03,615
intentionally wake him up now
that he's so kindly gone to sleep?!

90
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:05,865
I don't know what he's planning,
but right now it doesn't matter!

91
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:10,205
In any case, we have to do
whatever it takes to buy some time,

92
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,625
and get ready for your next Fusion!

93
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:15,205
That's the only way we can defeat him! Got it?

94
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:16,915
Okay...

95
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:23,175
What?!

96
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:30,225
W-What <i>ki</i> is this?!

97
00:09:30,265 --> 00:09:33,055
Someone's coming!

98
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:34,605
Who is it?!

99
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:38,235
Th-They're strong! This is a fantastic <i>ki</i>!

100
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:42,065
I-I don't know it! Who can it be?!

101
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:44,775
Is it a new enemy? Or is it instead...?

102
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:57,665
I-It's Goku!!

103
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:07,595
No it isn't! It's Big Brother! Big Brother!

104
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:08,885
Gohan-<i>san</i>?!

105
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:13,805
W-What?

106
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:17,225
It couldn't be!

107
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:39,205
Thank goodness I'm in time!

108
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:42,165
–Gohan-<i>san...</i>
–Big Brother! Thank goodness!

109
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:44,375
You weren't dead, huh?

110
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:49,715
Nah. It was a close one, but
I was saved by Kaioshin-<i>sama.</i>

111
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:53,385
Up to now, I've been at Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>'s place.

112
00:10:56,185 --> 00:11:01,185
<i>I-Is that Gohan? No.</i>
<i>There's something different!</i>

113
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,025
<i>The look on his face is a little different,</i>

114
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,355
<i>and he has a different</i>
<i>sort of ki than before, too.</i>

115
00:11:05,395 --> 00:11:07,195
<i>On top of that, his meekness has disappeared.</i>

116
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:10,825
<i>That's why I couldn't tell it was him.</i>

117
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,365
What about everyone else?

118
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:15,245
They were killed by Majin Boo!

119
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:18,835
What?! Including Mom
and Dende and the others?

120
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:22,205
That's right! Everyone except for us!

121
00:11:22,245 --> 00:11:26,835
<i>That's done it! To think that</i>
<i>even Dende had been killed!</i>

122
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:31,545
<i>How can this be?! The Dragon Balls, upon</i>
<i>which everything depends, have vanished!</i>

123
00:11:33,425 --> 00:11:35,385
They were delicious!

124
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:39,725
I ate them, after I turned them into choco!

125
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:47,735
No, that's not true! I can feel it! A faint <i>ki...</i>

126
00:12:25,475 --> 00:12:29,145
Hey, don't tell me you intend to fight me!

127
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:34,615
No. I intend to kill you!

128
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:56,425
Okay, Gohan! Show him your power,
now that you've undergone that power-up!

129
00:12:56,465 --> 00:12:59,265
Still, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, when you first said

130
00:12:59,305 --> 00:13:03,855
you were going to bring Gohan-<i>san</i>
to this holy region, the Kaioshin Realm,

131
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:06,855
I was thinking, "What could come from this?"

132
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:10,445
Kibit, I was right in my judgment, wasn't I?

133
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:13,325
Yes. Not only did he pull
out the legendary Z-Sword,

134
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:17,445
which even successive generations
of Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> were unable to do,

135
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:22,205
but he also released the Grand
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> that was sealed within it!

136
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:24,285
Indeed. To think that in fourteen generations,

137
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:32,885
and with fourteen other Kaioshin,
not one was able to break my seal...

138
00:13:32,925 --> 00:13:35,305
P-Please, forgive us!

139
00:13:35,345 --> 00:13:39,055
Even so, I think that
effectively, this is for the best.

140
00:13:39,095 --> 00:13:41,345
After all, the human realm should be defended

141
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:43,475
by the hands of humans themselves.

142
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:44,805
I think so too.

143
00:13:44,845 --> 00:13:48,315
After all, the future ain't something
to be handed to us by someone.

144
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:49,815
Which is why...

145
00:13:49,855 --> 00:13:52,815
People must always continue to work for it,

146
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:55,485
and it's precisely because
we have a future we believe in

147
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:58,365
that people can hold life precious.

148
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:05,335
Now that I think about it,
I'm dead, huh? Oh, well...

149
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,335
Still, Goku-<i>san</i>, what you say is correct.

150
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:13,335
Hmph! I knew that without
having to be lectured by you fellas!

151
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:16,595
After all, how many years
do you think I've been alive?!

152
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:24,515
Everyone together
making a fool of the old guy...!

153
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:27,265
That's not how it is!

154
00:14:28,895 --> 00:14:33,735
Hang in there, Gohan! The future
of Earth rests on your shoulders!

155
00:15:03,345 --> 00:15:08,895
I remember! You're the guy I blew away earlier!

156
00:15:08,935 --> 00:15:11,065
You're going to kill me?

157
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:14,485
Looks like you want to get
blown away by me once again!

158
00:15:20,945 --> 00:15:25,245
<i>I-It's hopeless! Judging from</i>
<i>his ki, Gohan has powered up,</i>

159
00:15:25,285 --> 00:15:29,285
<i>but no matter how much, there's no</i>
<i>way he can win by fighting him head-on!</i>

160
00:15:29,325 --> 00:15:33,465
I-It's too dangerous! We have to use
Fusion and fight together with him!

161
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:37,465
We can't! We can't do that
until an hour has gone by!

162
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:41,965
I know! But let's at least try to do what we can!

163
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:45,305
After all, at this rate, Big Brother will be...!

164
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:47,935
Goten...

165
00:15:47,975 --> 00:15:52,975
All right! Let's try to fight
together, even if it is hopeless!

166
00:15:58,815 --> 00:15:59,985
All right!

167
00:17:04,385 --> 00:17:06,765
N-Now you've done it!

168
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:13,515
B-Big Brother...!

169
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:15,265
A-Awesome!

170
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,015
Way to go, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

171
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:01,275
What's the matter? Weren't
you going to blow me away?

172
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:08,905
I will blow you away! I will blow you away!

173
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:11,115
I will blow you away!!

174
00:18:43,485 --> 00:18:46,825
<i>Unbelievable! What the</i>
<i>hell has happened to him?</i>

175
00:18:46,865 --> 00:18:48,785
<i>It's hard to believe he's the same Gohan!</i>

176
00:18:48,825 --> 00:18:54,205
<i>And he's not even</i>
<i>Super Saiyan, but that power...!</i>

177
00:18:54,245 --> 00:18:56,785
Way to go, Big Brother!

178
00:18:56,825 --> 00:19:00,295
That level of attack couldn't
have had any effect on you.

179
00:19:00,335 --> 00:19:03,835
It's useless for you to try to trick me.

180
00:19:10,505 --> 00:19:14,015
Damn! It hasn't affected him at all!

181
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:45,715
What's the matter? Aren't you
going to come? In that case, I'll go!

182
00:20:15,235 --> 00:20:17,155
He's coming! He's coming! He's coming!

183
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,655
W-What's this?!

184
00:22:03,515 --> 00:22:04,895
Over here.

185
00:22:08,515 --> 00:22:10,025
You retard.

186
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:20,495
<i>With his ultimate power,</i>
<i>Gohan tosses Majin Boo around!</i>

187
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:25,205
<i>The light of hope for the</i>
<i>Earth has begun to shine!</i>

188
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:38,635
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

189
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:45,225
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

190
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:55,775
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

191
00:22:55,815 --> 00:23:01,865
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

192
00:23:01,905 --> 00:23:08,875
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

193
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:14,255
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

194
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:18,135
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

195
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:27,225
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

196
00:23:27,265 --> 00:23:28,725
<i>Even now?</i>

197
00:23:28,765 --> 00:23:36,405
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

198
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:41,785
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

199
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:48,245
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

200
00:23:48,285 --> 00:23:58,295
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

201
00:24:13,395 --> 00:24:15,695
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

202
00:24:15,735 --> 00:24:19,405
<i>It looks like you're stunned by</i>
<i>Gohan's power, huh, Majin Boo?</i>

203
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:23,195
<i>I will not stand for any</i>
<i>power stronger than mine!</i>

204
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:27,365
<i>Absolutely not, absolutely not!</i>
<i>I won't stand for you!</i>

205
00:24:27,405 --> 00:24:29,535
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

206
00:24:29,575 --> 00:24:32,285
<i>"Has He Done It!?</i>
<i>Majin Boo's Great Explosion."</i>

207
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:37,585
<i>What does this mean? What is</i>
<i>he planning by blowing himself up?</i>

208
00:24:37,625 --> 00:24:39,425
"Next time"
"Has He Done It!?
Majin Boo's Great Explosion"
