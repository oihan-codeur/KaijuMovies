5
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:43,485
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:52,355
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

15
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:39,175

00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:41,895

<i>"Transformed At Last!!</i>
<i>Son Goku, the Legendary Super Saiyan."</i>

20
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:25,375

21
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,015
Where's Father?

22
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:31,545
Where's Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

23
00:03:33,725 --> 00:03:37,025
Father and Piccolo were right nearby.

24
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:40,055
You don't think they got
caught in the middle of it, do you?

25
00:03:41,065 --> 00:03:43,225
They couldn't have been!

26
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:55,235
I don't feel their <i>ki...</i>

27
00:03:56,645 --> 00:04:01,215
That's just because we've
lost our powers of concentration.

28
00:04:05,385 --> 00:04:09,555
Piccolo was there with him!
They're not about to die!

29
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,895
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, over there...

30
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:37,385
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

31
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:00,375
It's Goku!

32
00:05:00,415 --> 00:05:04,045
Father! He's alive!

33
00:05:04,085 --> 00:05:06,045
We did it, we did it!

34
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:08,575
Just like I told you, right?!

35
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:20,025
Damn! With barely any <i>ki</i>
left, we can't fly very fast!

36
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:21,695
Father!

37
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:24,395
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

38
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:27,365
Piccolo!

39
00:05:27,405 --> 00:05:29,565
Father!

40
00:05:44,755 --> 00:05:47,055
Father!

41
00:05:47,095 --> 00:05:49,255
G-Gohan...

42
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:57,925
Hey, Goku, are you okay?

43
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:07,205
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

44
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:28,025
Gohan, you must have been worried.

45
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:31,365
It was incredible! That <i>Genki Dama</i>!

46
00:06:31,405 --> 00:06:33,365
Wasn't it huge?!

47
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,035
That it was.

48
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:38,365
It had the hopes of everyone in
the universe packed inside it, after all.

49
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:42,675
I was afraid the two of you had died...

50
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:47,345
You expect us to bite the dust so easily?

51
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:51,345
Now we can head back to
Earth with our heads held high.

52
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:54,355
I didn't think I was ever going to be able to...

53
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:55,885
What's that?

54
00:06:58,325 --> 00:07:02,025
I-I just wanted to give
it a shot once, y'know!

55
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:03,555
Marriage.

56
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,685
Goku did it!

57
00:07:23,725 --> 00:07:26,345
With the <i>Genki Dama</i> I taught him!

58
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:32,025
He really did it to that Freeza
with a super-giant <i>Genki Dama</i>!

59
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:35,725
Freeza<i>-sama</i> beaten by that monkey scum?!

60
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:39,025
T-That can't be!

61
00:07:39,065 --> 00:07:40,565
Never!

62
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:44,565
I don't believe it!

63
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:52,705
Goku won!

64
00:07:52,745 --> 00:07:54,375
And we're going to stick it out too!

65
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:59,285
With Piccolo<i>-san</i> still alive,
we can all go back to Earth.

66
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,385
All right! Let's go!

67
00:08:01,425 --> 00:08:02,385
Charge!

68
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:03,915
Dibs!

69
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:38,385
<i>Purple Comet–</i>

70
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:41,595
<i>–Zed Crush</i>!

71
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:31,915
W-What was that <i>oni</i>?

72
00:09:58,745 --> 00:10:00,405
Order up!

73
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:13,255
Oh? We have so many guests today <i>oni</i>!

74
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:20,555
Jheese! Butta! ReaCoom!

75
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:36,205
Yeah, we won, we won!

76
00:10:36,245 --> 00:10:39,585
We beat the Ginyu Special Corps!

77
00:10:40,755 --> 00:10:45,385
Dammit! We can't just leave it like this!

78
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:46,885
It's no use, <i>oni</i>!

79
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:52,385
It's easy to drop down here into Hell,
but crawling out is very difficult <i>oni</i>!

80
00:10:52,425 --> 00:10:56,265
Nothing is impossible for
ReaCoom<i>-sama</i>, of the Ginyu Special Corps!

81
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,905
ReaCoom Jump!

82
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:43,505
You fought well!

83
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:47,545
You guys have improved more than I thought!

84
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,845
To think that you could so easily
kick around those training partners

85
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:54,955
I took the trouble to call here...

86
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:57,055
Training partners?

87
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:04,025
To tell the truth, in order to give
you some training in actual battle,

88
00:12:04,065 --> 00:12:08,035
I made a request of Yama the Great to
have the Ginyu Special Corps sent here.

89
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:13,705
Given their powers, it isn't likely
they'll be able to climb out of Hell.

90
00:12:13,745 --> 00:12:16,235
Well done, well done!

91
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:21,845
Your training partners
have parted and run away!

92
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:25,015
Your training partners have parted!

93
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:26,215
Good joke!

94
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,385
Shall we go home?

95
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:09,625
The spaceship I came in can
get us back to Earth in five days.

96
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:11,935
I'll see Mother!

97
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:16,265
We'll see everyone!

98
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:28,975
Ouchie...!

99
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:33,315
I completely forgot! Bulma<i>-san</i>!

100
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,415
Don't scare me like that!

101
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:39,985
I thought that maybe Freeza
had shown up again, you know!

102
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:44,965
I-In some senses, Bulma<i>-san</i>
is even scarier than Freeza!

103
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:57,945
Ooh, ow! Don't make me
laugh so much, I ache all over!

104
00:14:02,785 --> 00:14:08,185
You know, Planet Namek
has endured something terrible.

105
00:14:08,225 --> 00:14:10,925
However, this should
allow the Grand Elder<i>-sama,</i>

106
00:14:10,965 --> 00:14:14,955
and all the others who
have died, to rest in peace now.

107
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:21,305
H-How is it you know about the Grand Elder?

108
00:14:28,675 --> 00:14:31,235
What is it, Kuririn?

109
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:07,945
Freeza!

110
00:15:21,365 --> 00:15:27,335
He took that huge <i>Genki Dama</i>
head-on, and yet he's still alive!

111
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,275
I-It can't be!

112
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:43,615
Goku!

113
00:16:10,015 --> 00:16:13,275
P-Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

114
00:16:17,015 --> 00:16:19,985
P... P...

115
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:28,865
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!!

116
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:41,275
Wha... no way!

117
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,945
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what is it?

118
00:16:57,365 --> 00:17:01,625
Piccolo's been... Piccolo's been done in!

119
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:07,995
But I thought Freeza
was supposed to be dead!

120
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:11,305
Freeza is a frightful one!

121
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:15,975
More so than I had imagined!

122
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:31,925
Piccolo! Hey, Piccolo!

123
00:17:39,035 --> 00:17:41,665
Free... za...!

124
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:46,335
Even I questioned whether or
not I was going to die this time.

125
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:50,605
I, Freeza<i>-sama</i>, nearly died!

126
00:17:57,055 --> 00:18:03,055
Run... Kuririn, Gohan...!

127
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:08,655
There's a spaceship very near
the location where I first arrived.

128
00:18:08,695 --> 00:18:12,105
Take Bulma and get yourselves
away from this planet, now!

129
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:17,305
Gohan, snap out of it!

130
00:18:18,705 --> 00:18:22,335
I will fight! I'm going
to avenge Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

131
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,575
Get the hell out of here!
You guys are in my way!

132
00:18:25,615 --> 00:18:28,015
Do you all want to die together here?

133
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:29,345
G-Goku...

134
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:30,345
Father...

135
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:32,615
You think I'm going to excuse you?

136
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:35,955
I'm not letting a single
one of you go home alive!

137
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,285
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

138
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:51,605
Kuririn!

139
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:55,275
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

140
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:01,905
Stop it, Freeza!

141
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:04,945
Goku!!

142
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:23,065
A-And this time?

143
00:19:23,105 --> 00:19:25,265
Kuririn...

144
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,955
Shall I do the little brat next?

145
00:19:46,795 --> 00:19:52,295
Y-You're going to pay for that...
How dare you... How dare you?!

146
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:34,275
How dare you... How dare you...?!

147
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:06,605
W-What?!

148
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:29,025
Gohan, take Piccolo with you
and get yourselves back to Earth.

149
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:31,895
He's still barely alive.

150
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:39,635
Go home now, while I still
have some sliver of reason left!

151
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:40,935
Right!

152
00:22:17,015 --> 00:22:20,305
<i>Goku's fury has gone beyond its bounds.</i>

153
00:22:20,345 --> 00:22:25,945
<i>What can Goku's transformation mean?</i>

154
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:48,805
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

155
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:54,645
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

156
00:22:54,685 --> 00:22:57,015
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

157
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:05,515
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

158
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:12,025
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

159
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:16,135

<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

161
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:22,275
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

162
00:23:23,975 --> 00:23:29,745
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

163
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:33,885
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

164
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:35,685
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

165
00:23:35,725 --> 00:23:39,725
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

166
00:23:39,765 --> 00:23:45,395
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

167
00:23:45,435 --> 00:23:47,565
<i>So sorry.</i>

168

<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

171
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:16,395
<i>My anger is turning to over flowing power.</i>

172
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:17,565
<i>You can destroy whole planets,</i>

173
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:20,795
<i>but it seems you can't even</i>
<i>destroy a single man, huh, Freeza?</i>

174
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:23,035
<i>Maybe you're a Super Saiyan,</i>

175
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,405
