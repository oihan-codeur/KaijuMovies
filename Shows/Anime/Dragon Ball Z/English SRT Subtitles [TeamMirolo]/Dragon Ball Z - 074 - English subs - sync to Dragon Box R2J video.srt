<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245

<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:55,785 --> 00:02:00,115
Jheese! How high is my battle power?

17
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:02,115
23,000.

18
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,525
What?!

19
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:12,455
<i>Having stolen Goku's body, Ginyu is</i>

20
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:27,775
<i>Ginyu's Body Change finishing</i>

21
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,375
<i>However, just then...</i>

22
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:34,385
Die!!

23
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:43,795
<i>Change</i>!!

24
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:49,435
<i>The Body Change burst forth</i>
<i>again, this time against Vegeta!</i>

25
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:51,995

26
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:59,475
<i>"Whoops!! Ginyu Has Turned Into a Frog."</i>

I-It can't be!

28
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:25,865
<i>Change</i>!!

29
00:03:27,175 --> 00:03:30,805
This is it! I can get my own body back!

30
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:32,335
Let me get there in time!

31
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,055
What?

32
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:45,455
O-Out of the way!

33
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:21,255
You bastard... How dare you... interfere?!

34
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,125
Ow-ow-ow-ow...

35
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:28,565
Looks like I'm back to normal.

36
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:34,135
W-What happened? What the
hell did Kakarrot do just now?

37
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,105
What was that light?

38
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:40,635
Did Goku jump between them
in order to stop Vegeta's attack?

39
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:54,085
I can sense Father!

40
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,755
Father is... Father is back in his own body!

41
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:58,755
What?

42
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,665
Are you sure, Gohan?

43
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:06,425
S-So then, that Ginyu bastard is now over there?

44
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:13,505
Damn!

45
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:18,415
I'll Change with you for sure this time, Vegeta!

46
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:19,745
I ain't going to let you!

47
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:20,875
What?!

48
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:33,125
<i>Ka...</i>

49
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:35,195
<i>me...</i>

50
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:39,575
That rotten Kakarrot...

51
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,475
<i>ha...</i>

52
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:45,505
<i>me...</i>

53
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,815
<i>Ha</i>!!

54
00:06:03,435 --> 00:06:09,765
Damn, I've taken terrible
damage... I can't control my <i>ki...</i>

55
00:06:12,835 --> 00:06:14,565
Father!

56
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,205
G-Goku!

57
00:06:23,185 --> 00:06:25,815
That was pretty stupid of you.

58
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:28,415
You won't get in my way any longer.

59
00:06:32,895 --> 00:06:41,965
T-This is bad! If we allow him to take
over Vegeta's body now... it's all over...

60
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:51,145
I'll take that body of yours!

61
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:03,085
<i>Chan–</i>

62
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,715
What?!

63
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:41,085
Impressive, Vegeta.

64
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:18,735
He's getting himself busted up,
just like he did against me.

65
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,725
He's planning on trading places with Vegeta!

66
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:30,775
What's the matter? Finished already?

67
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,145
That's right! You...

68
00:08:36,145 --> 00:08:37,745
...are finished!

69
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:42,255
Stop, Vegeta!

70
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:51,485
You fell for it, Vegeta!

71
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:55,695
T-This is it.

72
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:58,435
<i>Change</i>!!

73
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,415
N-Now what happened?

74
00:09:57,465 --> 00:09:59,435
Ribbit... ribbit...

75
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,095
Ribbit... ribbitribbitribbit...

76
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:13,675
I-I did it!

77
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:18,715
G-Goku! Are you okay?

78
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:21,085
Father! Hang on!

79
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:32,055
Y-You really did quite a number...
on my body, didn't you, Vegeta?

80
00:10:32,095 --> 00:10:38,095
Never mind that, explain to
me what happened to Ginyu.

81
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:40,435
That guy that ran away is a frog.

82
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:45,105
And that frog-looking
thing over there is now Ginyu.

83
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:45,975
What?

84
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:51,845
Ribbit... ribbit...

85
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,815
I don't know how you did it, but
I'm still going to mash you underfoot.

86
00:11:05,135 --> 00:11:06,795
Leave him alone, Vegeta.

87
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:12,765
Now that Ginyu is like that,
he can't do anything.

88
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,665
Oh, all right, you can go.

89
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:18,805
I pity you when I think
of the life ahead of you.

90
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:24,745
Goku!

91
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,855
Father!

92
00:11:45,175 --> 00:11:50,135
Hey, Goku, don't you have a single senzu left?

93
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:54,015
N-Nope, I've really had it.

94
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:02,815
There's no reason why I couldn't
vaporize you bothersome guys right now.

95
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:04,815
What?

96
00:12:04,855 --> 00:12:08,925
Vegeta, you dirty, lowdown...

97
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:20,105
I-It's all right. He can't kill us just yet.

98
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:23,875
You're right. There's still
the matter of the Dragon Balls,

99
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:26,235
as well as the fight against Freeza,

100
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:29,845
and I'm going to need everyone's
power, especially yours, Kakarrot.

101
00:12:29,885 --> 00:12:32,115
–Come on.
–W-Where to?

102
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:37,795
Inside the spaceship. Bring Kakarrot with you.

103
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:48,095
W-What are you going to do to Goku?!

104
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,765
I'm offering to heal him.

105
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:52,775
Why should we believe you?!

106
00:12:56,145 --> 00:13:01,585
Fine, suit yourselves. You can
croak right alongside Kakarrot.

107
00:13:04,115 --> 00:13:05,615
Damn it...

108
00:13:05,655 --> 00:13:07,815
K-Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

109
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,115
K-Kuririn, it's all right.

110
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,715
It's all right?

111
00:13:11,755 --> 00:13:17,125
Vegeta's enemy right now is Freeza, not us.

112
00:13:17,165 --> 00:13:19,155
B-But...

113
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:30,835
Let's go, Kuririn<i>-san.</i>

114
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:43,685
Hurry it up. We don't know
when Freeza will be coming back.

115
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,795
In here.

116
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,265
You go first.

117
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:34,565
This will treat Kakarrot's
injuries and restore him to full power.

118
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:38,265
W-With all this?

119
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,615
A needle!

120
00:14:54,795 --> 00:14:57,095
N-No way!

121
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:00,765
I hate needles! Let go of me, Kuririn!

122
00:15:00,805 --> 00:15:04,065
I don't need any medical attention!

123
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:09,375
You think I would treat you with something
as uncivilized as a needle, you idiot?!

124
00:15:11,115 --> 00:15:12,875
R-Really?

125
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:16,745
<i>Oh, Father, how pathetic!</i>

126
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,785
Vegeta, what is this, anyhow?

127
00:15:29,825 --> 00:15:35,425
It's called a Medical Machine.
In short, it's like a healing capsule.

128
00:15:35,465 --> 00:15:37,895
By immersing oneself in this special solution,

129
00:15:37,935 --> 00:15:41,735
one's energy is restored to
them in a short amount of time.

130
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,735
So that's how...

131
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:49,075
<i>After I've defeated Freeza,</i>
<i>I'll kill you guys nice and slow.</i>

132
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:56,355
<i>By that time, make no mistake,</i>
<i>I will be a Super Saiyan!</i>

133
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:24,775
How about you speak to me, already?

134
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:27,415
Just telling me one simple thing is enough.

135
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:30,415
How do I get the Dragon Balls to grant my wish?

136
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:33,115
All you have to do is tell me that.

137
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,895
Y-You expect me... to tell you?

138
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:53,475
You do not need to say anything else.

139
00:16:55,145 --> 00:16:59,145
Well? Do you still want me to continue this?

140
00:17:02,025 --> 00:17:03,685
Up yours!

141
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:24,705
<i>My apologies, Nail.</i>
<i>Bear it just a little while longer.</i>

142
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:29,905
<i>Very soon, Dende will</i>
<i>arrive at the Earthlings' location.</i>

143
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:36,545
<i>Please, allow my life to last</i>
<i>for at least that much longer.</i>

144
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:49,695
<i>J-Just a little farther. Grand Elder-sama</i>
<i>said they were in the Maima region.</i>

145
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:58,375
The Medical Machine in
this room is the older model,

146
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:02,075
but knowing Kakarrot, he should
be fully rejuvenated before too long.

147
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,075
The older model?

148
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:08,285
I destroyed the newer model.

149
00:18:08,325 --> 00:18:11,455
H-He's not going to drown
or anything in there, right?

150
00:18:12,955 --> 00:18:17,485
<i>T-This sure feels good.</i>

151
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,095
Now then, let's get you two some battle wear.

152
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:26,765
You'll do better by them,
as far as protection goes.

153
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:30,105
Battle wear? You mean like yours?

154
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:33,015
That's not how I want to picture us.

155
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:44,055
Boy, their civilization
sure is ahead of Earth's.

156
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:46,255
It sure seems like it.

157
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:51,725
Take off your clothes
and put on that undershirt.

158
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:55,825
Hurry it up. Freeza is coming.

159
00:18:55,865 --> 00:19:01,065
Say, Gohan, if Vegeta
feels he needs even our help,

160
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:03,705
it must mean that Freeza is awfully strong, huh?

161
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:07,745
It scares me.

162
00:19:07,785 --> 00:19:09,745
Now for your battle jackets.

163
00:19:09,785 --> 00:19:11,345
Luckily enough, there
are some smaller sizes here,

164
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,615
for use by those from Planet Litt.

165
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,755
How do we put these on?

166
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:23,755
I can get my head
through, but my arms won't fit.

167
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,025
Just force them on.

168
00:19:25,065 --> 00:19:28,765
Those are soft enough that if
you pull on them, they'll stretch.

169
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:31,595
Back on Earth, even when
I turned into a Great Ape,

170
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:34,435
my armor didn't break, remember?

171
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,635
Yet they can still stand
up to a shock pretty well.

172
00:19:42,085 --> 00:19:44,245
Wow, you're right!

173
00:19:46,755 --> 00:19:50,715
Are the gloves and boots
made of the same material?

174
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:52,415
I suppose.

175
00:19:53,895 --> 00:19:55,225
This is incredibly light!

176
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:01,065
I barely feel any weight at all!

177
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:06,065
It's awful slimy of you guys
to be wearing stuff this nice.

178
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:07,935
What do you say, Vegeta?

179
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,945
Is something the matter?

180
00:20:15,185 --> 00:20:17,515
I-It's nothing.

181
00:20:17,555 --> 00:20:20,375
I wish I had armor more like Vegeta's style.

182
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:23,745
The shoulder area seems a
lot easier to move around in.

183
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:29,755
This is an older type. There weren't
any that fit me in the regular sizes.

184
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:37,365
However, these don't seem to be in the
way at all, Kuririn<i>-san.</i> I can move freely!

185
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:45,035
Are you sure you're all right?

186
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:47,035
You don't need to
concern yourself about me.

187
00:20:47,075 --> 00:20:50,275
Well, if you say so.

188
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:54,715
So, what about Goku? How
long will it take him to heal?

189
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:55,745
Good question.

190
00:20:55,785 --> 00:20:59,915
Knowing him, he should be fully
healed in around 40 or 50 minutes.

191
00:21:01,465 --> 00:21:07,055
Gohan, I'm going to go see Grand Elder<i>-sama.</i>

192
00:21:07,095 --> 00:21:10,395
I know that Freeza is probably there too,

193
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,735
but if we can't get the
password to summon Shen Long,

194
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:15,635
there's nothing we can do anyhow.

195
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:18,405
I-I'll go too!

196
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:23,105
No. I can handle this myself. You wait here.

197
00:21:31,795 --> 00:21:33,385
<i>Goku and the others regroup,</i>

198
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:37,795
<i>preparing themselves for</i>
<i>the coming conflict with Freeza.</i>

199
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:26,635
<i>Who is it that will be able to summon</i>
<i>Shen Long from the still silent Dragon Balls</i>?

200
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:48,995
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

201
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:54,805
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

202
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:57,175
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

203
00:23:00,685 --> 00:23:05,705
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

204
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:12,215
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

205
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:16,325
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

206
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:19,825
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

207
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,465
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

208
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:29,975
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

209
00:23:32,215 --> 00:23:34,075
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

210
00:23:34,115 --> 00:23:35,875
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

211
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,915
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

212
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:45,585
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

213
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,755
<i>So sorry.</i>

214
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:52,895
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

215
00:23:55,635 --> 00:24:00,905
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

216
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:14,585
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

217
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,455
<i>There he is! The original is</i>
<i>far bigger than Earth's dragon!</i>

218
00:24:17,495 --> 00:24:19,655
<i>So that's Super Shen Long, is it?</i>

219
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:22,325
<i>It will be to me, Freeza-sama,</i>
<i>that the wish is granted.</i>

220
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:25,055
<i>It will not be to you lower life forms.</i>

221
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:27,095
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

222
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:31,095
<i>"Thou Who Hast Gathered the Seven Balls...</i>
<i>Now Speak Forth the Password."</i>

223
00:24:31,135 --> 00:24:34,565
<i>Takaraputo Poppolunga Pupirito Paro!</i>

224
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:36,545
<i>That's the password!</i>

225
00:24:36,585 --> 00:24:38,605
"Next time"
"Thou Who Hast Gathered the Seven Balls...
Now Speak Forth the Password"
