<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,210
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4

<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,850

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,190

<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,330
<i>Was Vegeta's death to no end?</i>

24
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,790
<i>Accompanied by Majin Boo,</i>
<i>boasting his fearsome power,</i>

25
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,500
<i>the time that Madoshi Babidi</i>
<i>begins to unfold his plans for revenge</i>

26
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,250
<i>has drawn ever closer.</i>

27
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:17,180
<i>Piccolo and Kuririn took the</i>
<i>only remaining hope for Earth,</i>

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,730
<i>Trunks and Goten, to seek</i>
<i>shelter at Kami's Palace,</i>

29
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,060
<i>where Dende and Popo were waiting for them.</i>

30
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,650
<i>Elsewhere, having been taken by</i>
<i>surprise and knocked out by Vegeta,</i>

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,200
<i>Goku finally regains consciousness.</i>

32
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,540
I can feel Majin Boo's <i>ki,</i>
but Vegeta's <i>ki</i> ain't there!

33
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,210
Don't tell me he got beaten! Not him!

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,380
I can't feel Gohan's <i>ki</i> either.

35
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,220
Piccolo and Kuririn are alive.

36
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,180
They must have been returned
from stone back to normal.

37
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,140
Those two might know what's been going on!

38
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,140
Th-That <i>ki</i>! It's...!

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,400
Yo!

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,030
Goku! Then you survived?!

41
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,960
<i>"Enormous Hope!! A New Finishing</i>
<i>Technique for the Little Squirts."</i>

42
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,300
...and that's how it is.

43
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,220
How can it be?

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:44,560
To think that Gohan, Kaioshin-<i>sama,</i>
and even Vegeta could get beaten!

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,490
Majin Boo's strength is, as feared by
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, beyond our imaginations.

46
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,410
If we leave him alone like this,
then there's really no mistaking it–

47
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,450
never mind Earthlings, every living
being in the universe will be wiped out.

48
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:03,080
But Goku, your having survived is the one
fortunate thing among all this misfortune.

49
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,790
Er, you have the halo there,
so you haven't really survived,

50
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,130
but I mean you haven't
died–no, that's not right,

51
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,090
you're dead, but alive...

52
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,630
Aaugh! This is getting me all mixed up!

53
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,970
Goku, you're the only one
that can defeat Majin Boo.

54
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,470
You can only stay in this
world for one day, right Goku?

55
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,310
There's still a little bit
of time remaining, and so,

56
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,690
you can manage something!

57
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,310
Kuririn...

58
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,320
I'll say this plainly.
It's no use. I can't beat him.

59
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,980
Th-That can't be!

60
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,320
I can't beat Majin Boo.

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,990
G-Goku?!

62
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,280
There wasn't hardly any difference
in power between me and Vegeta.

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,200
Vegeta gave all he had, yet
Majin Boo is still perfectly fine, right?

64
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,170
Sorry, but no matter what I do, I can't win.

65
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,010
So that's it? Not even Goku can help, huh?

66
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,300
I guess not...

67
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,890
Damn! If either Vegeta or Gohan had survived,

68
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,220
there might still be something we could do...

69
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,480
No, no matter how many of us
gang up, it probably would do no good.

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,060
Majin Boo isn't at such a level as that.

71
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,690
Naw, that ain't it. We could use Fusion.

72
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,070
W-What's this "Few–" whatever business?

73
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,400
Fusion!

74
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,660
Fusion... Merging together, right?!

75
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,870
You know about it, Dende?

76
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,040
Yes! I've never seen it, but when
I was on Planet Namek, I heard about it.

77
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,670
It's the specialty technique
of the Metamorans, they said.

78
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,220
That's it! I had one of the Metamorans
I met in the Other World teach it to me.

79
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,220
What kind of technique is it?

80
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,050
It's a unification technique
that can be used only if

81
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,270
the powers and body sizes
of two people are pretty close.

82
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,100
Unification technique?

83
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,100
In other words, by having
two people unite into one,

84
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,070
they become a new individual,

85
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,610
with awesome powers that neither
one of them could have on their own!

86
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,070
Yeah?

87
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,280
Come to mention it, Piccolo-<i>san</i> and Nail-<i>san</i>

88
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,410
also underwent a form
of merging, didn't you?

89
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,490
Ours was an assimilation.

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,330
Impossible... How can this be?

91
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,340
What incredible power!

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,800
What an unbelievably
fearsome power this is!

93
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,930
Is this what uniting with someone is like?!

94
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,480
I will win! Regardless of the
opponent, I cannot lose now!

95
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,440
I have now obtained the ultimate power!

96
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,990
Assimilation is certainly awesome,

97
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,990
but this Fusion thing
is even more awesome!

98
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,000
The Metamorans who taught me, right?

99
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,630
They were both weak, gentle little guys,

100
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,000
but once they used their Fusion,

101
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,460
they transformed into
quite a formidable warrior!

102
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,380
I've got a good understanding of it.

103
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,300
After all, in the case of Nail and me,

104
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,060
just by assimilating, we had quite a power up.

105
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,560
If either Vegeta or Gohan were alive,
you could have done this Fusion,

106
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,020
become some extraordinary warrior,
and fought against Majin Boo, right?!

107
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,570
Yeah. Of course, it took me
about a week to learn the technique.

108
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,410
Even supposing Vegeta
or Gohan had survived,

109
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,990
it would probably have been
impossible to teach it to them.

110
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,370
I can't stay in this world
more than a day, and all.

111
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,840
On top of that, I've been taught the
technique, but I've never tried it out.

112
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,250
There ain't anyone about the
same as me in the Other World.

113
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,050
In any case, it would've been impossible.

114
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,060
No, it's not impossible!

115
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,600
Kuririn, what do you mean?

116
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,600
Goku, you'll be returned to the
Other Side pretty soon, right?

117
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,400
But the dead Gohan and Vegeta
will be there too, won't they?

118
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,440
You can still do this Fusion, can't you?

119
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,610
Hey, yeah! There is that way!

120
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,860
No, it won't work.

121
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,450
Goku cannot come to this world once more,

122
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,410
even if he were to accomplish Fusion.

123
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:05,550
Two sleeping inside, Goten and Trunks,
power and size about identical.

124
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,510
Can they do Fusion?

125
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,930
It's too much for them, right?

126
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,610
No... Nice work, Mister Popo!
That's the way! There is that way!

127
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,980
Goku-<i>san</i>!

128
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,990
Way to go, way to go, Mister Popo! You did it!

129
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,610
But Goku, do you have time?

130
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,620
Yeah. I'll teach Fusion to the
half-pints up to the last minute,

131
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,580
but just that ain't going to be enough time.

132
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,420
Piccolo, why don't you take
over training them afterward?

133
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,590
You got it.

134
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,630
Yea! We've got hope now!

135
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,840
Those two pipsqueaks just
might be able to pull this off!

136
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,350
However...

137
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:58,520
It will take quite a bit of time for Trunks
and Goten to master this Fusion thing.

138
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,980
During that time, a
considerable number of people

139
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,530
will become casualties of Majin Boo.

140
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,530
They might all even be exterminated–

141
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,030
no, the whole Earth
could possibly be destroyed.

142
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,160
We'll have to risk it.

143
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,710
Whatever happens, we have to
be prepared to endure anything

144
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,500
until the pee-wees master Fusion.

145
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,210
Piccolo, even if they are exterminated,

146
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,010
as long as you guys have the Dragon
Balls, you can return things to normal.

147
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,380
That's right, huh?

148
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,550
There's still some hope remaining!

149
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,590
H-Hey! Majin Boo!

150
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,530
B-Boo! W-Watch out!

151
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,750
Stop!

152
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,630
B-Boo! Do something! Do you
want to get sealed up again?!

153
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,800
–-What's that?
–Some event, probably.

154
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,350
Majin Boo, enough already!

155
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,300
Bulma, let's hurry and call forth Shen Long!

156
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,800
Say, is this really for real?

157
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,640
Such a cute face, yet she's so skeptical, huh?

158
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,940
Videl-<i>san</i>, keep those
eyes peeled wide and watch!

159
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,270
This is somethin' you won't be seein' on TV!

160
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:51,610
But it's unbelievable that a
dragon can come out of those balls!

161
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,780
Bulma, you know the incantation
to call out Shen Long, right?

162
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,160
Of course! We're not going
to goof up the way Freeza did!

163
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,580
Bulma, yell that spell well!

164
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,120
Oh, dear!

165
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:09,250
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Old man!
This is no time to be making poor jokes!

166
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,590
Of all the...!

167
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:15,180
There's an incantation, huh? I guess that fits...

168
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,760
Bulma, hurry and summon
Shen Long so we can bring back to life

169
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,640
all the spectators killed by Vegeta.

170
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,020
I know.

171
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,860
Come forth, Shen Long,
and grant me my wish!

172
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,770
All right, in any case,
I'm going to go get everyone.

173
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,200
What? It's suddenly gotten dark!

174
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,570
I-It's...!

175
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,710
Shen Long is coming out? W-Why?!

176
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,880
Bulma-<i>san</i> is the one who
gathered the Dragon Balls, right?

177
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,130
She must not know the situation yet!
Why would she call up Shen Long?

178
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,220
That's it! Vegeta killed a bunch of
people at the tournament grounds!

179
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,220
She's trying to bring them back to life!

180
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:49,230
Th-This is bad! If all three wishes get granted,

181
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,600
it will be another year before
any more wishes are possible!

182
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,150
Okay, I'll go right away and stop them.

183
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,000
Damn, Bulma and the others'
<i>ki</i> are hard to search out...

184
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,820
Y-You're kidding!

185
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,330
W-What's that?!

186
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,710
Unreal!

187
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:05,680
I shall grant thee any three wishes.

188
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,140
A-Am I dreaming?!

189
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,140
Speak thy wishes now!

190
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,150
Um, how shall I word this...?

191
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,520
Such a hassle! Bring back to
life everyone that died today!

192
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,150
Oh, and leave out the bad guys!

193
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,700
That should do it, right?

194
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,160
Thank you!

195
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,700
Bring back those people who have died?
Is that really possible?

196
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:34,040
All right, I have granted the first wish.

197
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,880
We're not dead, huh?!

198
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,470
Banzai! We're back alive!

199
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:07,860
Here it is!

200
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,540
I shall now hear your second wish.

201
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,040
Aw, hell! I wasn't in time!

202
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,540
–Son-<i>kun</i>!
–Goku!
–Goku!

203
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:22,920
Goku-<i>sa</i>, where have you been?!

204
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,090
Where's Gohan?! Where's Goten?!

205
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,550
Chichi, there ain't time
for this! I'll tell you later.

206
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,930
Dende, can you hear me?

207
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:31,930
Yes.

208
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,560
I was a bit late.

209
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,940
Shen Long has already granted a
wish, but just one. What should I do?

210
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,860
I-Is that so?

211
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,360
In that case, please tell him the
other two wishes are all right for now.

212
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,570
If there's only been one, then we
can use him again in four months.

213
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,120
So that's it, got it!

214
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,450
Oh, and one other thing!

215
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,580
Everyone's gathered together here,

216
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,460
so tell Kuririn for me that
I'll bring everyone there.

217
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,460
Yes, understood.

218
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,920
Okay!

219
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,920
Shen Long! That's all the wishes
this time around! Thank you!

220
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,930
We'll be counting on you next time!

221
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,390
Well then, farewell.

222
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:31,030
W-What is it, Goku?!
What the hell is going on now?

223
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,670
I-I'm sure I'm supposed to
have been killed by Dabura...

224
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:56,560
Well, let's do this.

225
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:25,840
H-Have I come back to life? Unbelievable...

226
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,590
Where is Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?!

227
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,400
Gohan-<i>san...</i>

228
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,280
...and that's it. Everybody, you're
coming with me now to Kami's palace,

229
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,700
where Kuririn and the
others are waiting for us.

230
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,740
Got it. In another four months,

231
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,910
I'll be sure to find the
seven Dragon Balls again!

232
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,450
Yeah, we're counting on it!

233
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:46,920
Okay, everybody, grab onto me.
I'm going to Instantaneously Move!

234
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,800
<i>T-To think this world existed!</i>
<i>I'm not dreaming, huh?</i>

235
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,140
Papa, Mama, what are you doing?
Hurry and join hands.

236
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:07,980
We can't bear to leave our animals
behind, so we're going to remain here.

237
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,440
W-What are you saying?

238
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,450
Surely seeking shelter for yourselves is
more important than your pets right now!

239
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,820
Right, Mama?

240
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:19,620
Bulma, if Mama is killed by this Majin Boo,

241
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,000
you can just bring us back
to life with the Dragon Balls.

242
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,080
Mama is staying with Papa.

243
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,460
Y-You can't be...

244
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,000
Son-<i>kun</i>...?

245
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,010
Bulma, if the worst happens, you
have to search for the Dragon Balls.

246
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,840
Huh? Videl-<i>san</i>, aren't you goin'?

247
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,140
Yes, I'm going! I'm going!

248
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,770
All right! Everybody, let's go!

249
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,030
So, let's go give our pet-<i>chan</i> s some food.

250
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,990
W-What was that?!

251
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,990
No sooner am I thinking it just
got dark than it's light out again!

252
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,750
Well, I guess none of that matters!
Majin Boo, shall we begin?

253
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,300
<i>Are Babidi's plans for</i>
<i>revenge about to get underway?</i>

254
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:23,510
<i>What is the fate of the Earth?</i>

255
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:30,350
<i>The faint remaining stars of hope,</i>
<i>Trunks and Goten, still continue to sleep...</i>

256
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,070
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

257
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,660
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

258
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,210
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

259
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:02,340
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

260
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:09,350
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

261
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:14,730
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

262
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,570
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

263
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:27,660
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

264
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,210
<i>Even now?</i>

265
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:36,840
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

266
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,220
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

267
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:48,720
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

268
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:58,730
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

269
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,670
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

270
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,260
<i>Huh? I'm hearing something!</i>
<i>That voice–it's Babidi!</i>

271
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,970
<i>People of the earth,</i>
<i>I'm looking for some people</i>

272
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,680
<i>who put me through a</i>
<i>rather disagreeable time earlier.</i>

273
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,510
<i>If they don't come forward,</i>
<i>it will mean big trouble for the earth!</i>

274
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,680
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

275
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,270
<i>"Goten and Trunks–</i>
<i>The World's Most Wanted."</i>

276
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,060
<i>Babidi, I'll make sure you pay for this!</i>

277
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,980
"Next time"
"Goten and Trunks–
The World's Most Wanted"
