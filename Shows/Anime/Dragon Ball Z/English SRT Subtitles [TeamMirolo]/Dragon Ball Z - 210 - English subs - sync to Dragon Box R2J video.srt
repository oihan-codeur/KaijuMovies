<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,220
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,980
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,610
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,860
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:54,620
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,210
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,130
<i>The sky is clear</i>

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,960
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,550
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,550
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,550
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,220
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:20,100
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,570
<i>My head is clear,</i>

00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,570
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,910
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:34,120
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,950
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,750
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,980
<i>After several years had passed,</i>

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,190
<i>The Z Warriors assemble</i>
<i>themselves once again,</i>

25
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:12,610
<i>to participate in the newly reopened</i>
<i>and refurbished Tenkaichi Tournament.</i>

26
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,450
Who will be able to surpass me?

27
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,100
I-It's showing one hundred thirty-seven points!

28
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,810
One hundred thirty-seven points!

29
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:51,860
<i>And so the qualifying round to</i>
<i>determine the other fifteen finalists began...</i>

30
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,910
Eighty-six points.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,040
S-Seven hundred seventy-four...?

32
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,510
Back away.

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,860
<i>...the Z Warriors make their way through</i>
<i>the preliminaries a step above the rest.</i>

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,530
<i>The greatest Tenkaichi Tournament</i>
<i>in all of history is about to begin.</i>

35
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,710
<i>"No Small Matter!! Little Trunks."</i>

36
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,870
Aw, he wrecked it...

37
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,250
I-I'm going home, if he'll be competing.

38
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,710
Can't take him anywhere...

39
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,800
H-Hey! Aren't you surprised at that?

40
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,800
That guy destroyed the Punch Machine, after all!

41
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,810
Y-Yeah, I was surprised.

42
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,640
I don't believe it! That whole group...

43
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,980
I think they're all in the same party,
and they all got around 200 points!

44
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,740
Yet up until them, the 137 points
recorded by my Papa was the highest score!

45
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,950
Oh, really?

46
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,080
Those of you who have yet
to go through the preliminary,

47
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,620
please wait just a moment.

48
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:08,120
We are preparing a new Punch Machine for you.

49
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:14,250
Hey, Vegeta! There's a Junior Division,
where the kids are entered into,

50
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,170
that's about to start. Wanna go watch?

51
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,640
Hmph, sure, why not?

52
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,890
It beats hanging around in this crummy place.

53
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,610
Here they come. I'd like to know
what the story is with this group.

54
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,610
Huh?!

55
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,780
Hey, the friend you mentioned was a girl?

56
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,660
This is a girl, right?

57
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,660
Y-Yes.

58
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,990
This is my friend Videl-<i>san.</i>

59
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,170
Nice going, there! She's pretty cute, isn't she?

60
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,210
No... see... that's not...

61
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,710
Trunks and the other's
matches are about to start,

62
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,550
so we're gonna go watch them.

63
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,970
You hurry up and get your
preliminary taken care of.

64
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,680
Right!

65
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,190
How long before they
start the preliminaries again?

66
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,560
You know them?

67
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,560
Hm? Yeah.

68
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,030
The one wearing the bright
orange-colored <i>gi</i> was my father.

69
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,570
Huh? Y-You said your father was dead!

70
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,570
Y-Yeah, that's right.

71
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,240
That's why he had that ring over his head, see?

72
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,040
What is the deal with you people?

73
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,760
And so, the reopening of the long-closed
Tenkaichi Tournament is about to begin!

74
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,140
First, the younger kids, those 15 and under,
will compete for victory in the Junior Division!

75
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,270
And though it may be the Junior Division,
the prize for first place is 10 million Zeni!

76
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,860
The prize for second place is 5 million Zeni!

77
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,950
Further, the youngster who wins the division
will, as a special attraction... what's this?

78
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:10,200
How wonderful! He will get to
fight with him as a special present!

79
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,210
And by him, of course I mean...

80
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:17,250
The Champion of the
Tenkaichi Tournament, Mister Satan!

81
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,510
"Martial"

82
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:38,610
Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan! Satan!

83
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,880
Are you all right?

84
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:26,570
Joke! Joke!!

85
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,070
Great!

86
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:43,050
Nice joke, Mister Satan!

87
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,010
It wasn't bad...

88
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,510
Now then,

89
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,890
in the time we have before the preliminaries are
finished and the Junior Division gets underway,

90
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,100
please enjoy this special event we've kept
especially for today, featuring Mister Satan!

91
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,570
What can it be,

92
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:10,570
but a motion picture recreating the role
Mister Satan played during the Cell Games!

93
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:16,540
We present to you "Our Savior
Mister Satan: A Record of Glory."

94
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,000
What? I haven't heard about this!

95
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,380
Awesome! A recreation of the Cell Games!

96
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,380
All right! I've always wanted to see this!

97
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:29,470
Hey, they say there's a movie.

98
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,270
Stop! This is something the
TV station made by themselves!

99
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,940
This isn't something I had
made so I could brag about it!

100
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:46,730
How modest of you to say.
Everyone, do you want to see the movie?

101
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,530
Okay, in that case, everyone do the Satan Call!

102
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,080
Hey, hold on now...

103
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,000
Satan! Satan! Satan!

104
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,550
Yea!

105
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:11,470
And so, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy the show!

106
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,740
What do you call that?!

107
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,120
We're gonna defeat you!

108
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,130
Oh, man!

109
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,310
You'll lose again!

110
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,140
Let's go!

111
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,320
This is absurd!

112
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,030
Don't get so upset.
It's pretty fun to watch, ain't it?

113
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,450
What's the matter?

114
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,530
Is that all you've got?!

115
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,910
D-Damn you!

116
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,290
In that case, I am the winner!

117
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,370
Wait!

118
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,680
<i>How embarrassing! I wish</i>
<i>they hadn't used that face!</i>

119
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,360
You fool!

120
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,570
Who's the fool now?

121
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:57,370
What?!

122
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,870
H-How did you get over there?!

123
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,540
Your tricks won't work on me!

124
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,410
Get him, Satan!

125
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,380
Finish him!

126
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,210
That's enough!

127
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,210
I told you this won't work!

128
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,930
I-I was wrong! Forgive me!
I won't do any more bad things!

129
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:27,230
Nothing doing! You're going to
pay for your evil deeds at my fist!

130
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:39,490
I-Incredible! Just what
we'd expect from Satan-<i>sama</i>!

131
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,920
Justice wins!

132
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,310
Sure is amazing what happens
when you let a fib go on this long!

133
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,730
Wow, that was wonderful! Absolutely wonderful!

134
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,070
Hmm? Mister Satan?

135
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,900
Satan-<i>san</i>?

136
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,400
How embarrassing!

137
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,570
Yes, just what we would expect from
our Champion! Most elegantly done!

138
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,360
You hush up!

139
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,510
All right! I'm going to win for sure,
and get Mister Satan's autograph!

140
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:51,480
Say, what are you going to
buy with your prize money?

141
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,610
Toys and candy!

142
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,690
You're such a kid, Goten.

143
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,280
What about you, Trunks-<i>kun</i>?

144
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,360
I'm not sure what I would do with it...

145
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,330
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, your family
is the richest in the world,

146
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,200
so there's probably nothing you want, huh?

147
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,500
Hmph! Look at them all!

148
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,040
There's nothing but weak,
provincial-looking types here!

149
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,850
Who's your first opponent?

150
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,360
Lucky, lucky! It's that runt over there!

151
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,900
Oh, that'll be an easy win for you!

152
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,820
Let's go have some fun with him!

153
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,370
Sounds good.

154
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,160
Now that you mention it,
I haven't thought of what I want.

155
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,040
Hey, pee-wee!

156
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Hey, you! I'm gonna beat you senseless!

157
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,290
Did you remember to put on your diaper?

158
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,220
Don't wet yourself, now!

159
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,850
Get lost, you idiot!

160
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,890
Wha–?!

161
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,520
You, and your jerkwater hairstyle.

162
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,690
What did you say?

163
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,310
Why, you...

164
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,450
You've really said it, didn't you?!

165
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:26,370
Now I've decided I'm gonna leave you half-dead!

166
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,990
Oh, really?

167
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:37,380
So how was our Special Event,
"Our Savior Mister Satan: A Record of Glory?"

168
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,590
And now, let's begin the Junior
Division of the Tenkaichi Tournament!

169
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:47,930
Looks like even the Tournament
couldn't keep itself from getting all flashy.

170
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,560
The ring's a lot bigger than it was before, too.

171
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,810
Hmm, it's all just an insignificant show now.

172
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,230
Look, there's Trunks!

173
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,280
As you know, the Junior
Division has no preliminary round.

174
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,820
35 youngsters have gathered
together at this tournament

175
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,910
to show off their skills for us.

176
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,290
The rules are the same as for the adults–

177
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:17,630
Give-ups, ring-outs, ten-count downs,
and being knocked out will constitute a loss.

178
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,920
Good luck, Trunks!

179
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,510
Goten-<i>chan</i>!

180
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,920
Whatever, just start this, already!

181
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,470
Here we are!

182
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,510
Ah, good. I've finally
found an open seat.

183
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,640
I should see Idasa-<i>chan</i> well from here.

184
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,560
<i>Why you...</i>

185
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,110
So, let's get started right away, then!

186
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:46,360
Our first match is between Bart-<i>kun,</i>
age 12, and Peppero-<i>kun</i>, age 14!

187
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,280
Aw, they're starting!

188
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,540
I wish they'd hurry this up!

189
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,330
That's right, Goten-<i>kun</i> will
be participating in this too!

190
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,430
Nice! Way to go!

191
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,230
As expected, Mister Satan,
your movie was a great hit!

192
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:21,850
Thanks to you, the video
version has sold out in one day!

193
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,070
That's only to be expected.

194
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,870
Oh, my! He has started crying!

195
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,580
Will he give up?

196
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,380
Hey, hey...

197
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,680
Ah, ringout!

198
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,100
This is remarkable!

199
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,640
A come-from-behind victory for Kadpi-<i>kun</i>!

200
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,240
This really is just a bunch of kids fighting.

201
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,700
And so, onto Round 7!
This is between Koryu-<i>kun</i>, age 10,

202
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,740
and Imamu-<i>kun</i>, age 8.

203
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,080
Begin!

204
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,800
Hold on there, son!

205
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,850
Ringout! That's as far as it goes!

206
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,110
Young man–

207
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,950
Don't cry!

208
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:55,620
Mister Satan!

209
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660
Stick out your chest!

210
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,200
Boys must not be made to cry so easily!

211
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:03,000
Okay!

212
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,290
There, that's a good boy.

213
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,840
Oh, what a delightful happening this is!

214
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,890
That's our Mister Satan!
What a heartwarming sight!

215
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,810
Nice going, Satan!

216
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,060
That was cool, Satan!

217
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:29,030
<i>Heh, that was perfect!</i>
<i>That was better than perfect!</i>

218
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,860
<i>I'll have to try using that again sometime.</i>

219
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,280
What was all that?

220
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,700
You've got me.

221
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,700
He manages to think up
something for every occasion.

222
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,830
Sounds like something eventful is going on.

223
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,710
Why can't they hurry this up?

224
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,800
Ringout! Karashnikov-<i>kun</i> wins!
Now, onto the ninth round!

225
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,220
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, age 8, versus Idasa-<i>kun</i>, age 15.

226
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,810
Oh, it's lil' Trunks!

227
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,810
Give him your best!

228
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,560
Ah, if he gives his best, things could get ugly.

229
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,060
Keep it under control!

230
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:14,990
You ready for this, you little turd?

231
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,910
"Silence" I'm ignoring you.

232
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,870
You're really starting to annoy me, kid!

233
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,460
I'm still ignoring you.

234
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,260
I feel sorry for that poor kid!
Age 8 versus age 15!

235
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,670
Good luck, Trunks!

236
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,930
Idasa-<i>chan</i>, it's your Mama!

237
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,850
What are you doing?!

238
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,730
Against a little opponent like that,

239
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,890
poor Idasa-<i>chan</i> won't even
be able to show his true ability.

240
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,570
You know, it's really too bad. Why did
my camera have to get broken like this?

241
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,200
Now I can't shoot Idasa-<i>chan</i>'s valiant form!

242
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,580
Trunks! Knock a hole in his dumb-looking face!

243
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,830
I never! How vulgar!

244
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,410
Begin!

245
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,830
Bring it on, you little turd! Come on!

246
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,340
You talk too much. I don't
need you to tell me what to do.

247
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,150
Hmph. Maybe I got a little too serious there.

248
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,910
Guess I'm still a kid too.

249
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,240
H-He's unconscious!

250
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,780
Trunks-<i>kun</i> wins!

251
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,500
Incredible!

252
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,790
Idasa-<i>chan</i>!

253
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,220
Hoo, boy. This is going to be
dull until Goten and Trunks go at it.

254
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,680
They said I was in the match after this one.

255
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:12,020
This is why I asked them to let
me fight with the adults. You know?

256
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,820
<i>The Tenkaichi Tournament finally</i>
<i>begins, with the Junior Division.</i>

257
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:25,370
<i>Just how powerful are the little</i>
<i>super-warriors, Trunks and Goten?</i>

258
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,710
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

259
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,300
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

260
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,860
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

261
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,990
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

262
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:08,950
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

263
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,330
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

264
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,210
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

265
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:27,310
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

266
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,850
<i>Even now?</i>

267
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:36,480
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

268
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,860
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

269
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:48,370
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

270
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:58,380
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

271
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,060
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

272
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,980
<i>Looks like Goten is</i>
<i>overcome by all of the spectators.</i>

273
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,190
<i>Don't go hurting your opponent too badly.</i>

274
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,530
<i>Son Goku-kun's son, huh?</i>
<i>I'm looking forward to this.</i>

275
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:27,320
<i>There are sensational fights in store,</i>

276
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,370
<i>like I haven't seen in a long time!</i>

277
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,240
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

278
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,370
<i>"It's My Turn!</i>
<i>Goten's Anxious First Fight."</i>

279
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,250
<i>I want to see this, but I haven't</i>
<i>finished the preliminaries yet.</i>

280
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:39,710
"Next time"
"It's My Turn!
Goten's Anxious First Fight"
