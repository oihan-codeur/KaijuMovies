<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:24,470
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>

3
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,720
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,480
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,070
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:51,910
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,410
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,450 --> 00:01:04,420
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,930
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:14,010
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,430
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,950
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:36,790
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,750
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:27,130
<i>The terrifying monster Cell</i>
<i>has at length absorbed No. 17.</i>

17
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,010
Even I myself am surprised
by my magnificent speed.

18
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:41,230
Of course, this is due to absorbing No. 17.

19
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,560
I wonder how my power is.

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,290
<i>He closed in, in an effort to absorb No. 18 as well.</i>

21
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:11,220
<i>However, just then, it was</i>
<i>Tenshinhan who stood forward!</i>

22
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,340
<i>Shin-Kikoho</i>!!

23
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,020
<i>"Tomorrow, I Am Going to Pulverize You!!</i>
<i>Goku's Challenge."</i>

24
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,660
What are you doing?!

25
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,070
Run away!

26
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,160
Run away from here!

27
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,210
Come on! Now, while we can, No. 16!

28
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,330
R-Right...

29
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,280
Let's go, No. 16!

30
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,540
D-Damned if I'm letting you get away!

31
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,220
Why, you...!

32
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,060
R-Rotten monster!

33
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,800
T-Tenshinhan-<i>san</i> is hanging in there.

34
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,010
But his <i>ki</i> is dropping rapidly!

35
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,890
Tenshinhan's <i>Shin-Kikoho...</i>
Uses considerable energy.

36
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,070
Even so, everything he
can do, stop Cell from moving.

37
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,990
If keeps this up...

38
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,990
S-Stop it, Tenshinhan!

39
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,360
Don't use your <i>Kikoho</i> any more!

40
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,830
I said stop it, and I mean stop it!

41
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:46,180
S-Still, the only one who can
keep Cell in check right now is me...

42
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,180
A-As long as my energy holds out...

43
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,040
S-Such an enormous <i>ki</i>!

44
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,370
H-How will this turn out?

45
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,050
C-Chaozu...

46
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:35,230
T-Ten-<i>san</i>'s g-going to die...!

47
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,400
S-Sorry, Chaozu.

48
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,610
There isn't anything we
can do. He's just too strong!

49
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,700
What are you sayin'?!

50
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,910
Goku-<i>sa</i>'s still around, isn't he?!

51
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,670
Gohan-<i>chan</i>'s gettin' stronger!

52
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,040
On top of that, Goku-<i>sa</i>'s about
to go and take care of that monster!

53
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,600
It's no good! Tenshinhan's
<i>ki</i> has dropped substantially!

54
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,810
If things keep going like this, Tenshinhan will be...

55
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,310
Ten-<i>san...</i>

56
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,610
Chaozu, let's go!

57
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:20,610
Right!

58
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,440
H-Hold on!

59
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,070
Even if you do go, there isn't
anything any more that you can do!

60
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,240
Not only that, but you will
just add to our casualties!

61
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,620
–But...!
–It's just as Chichi said.

62
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,080
All we can do is wait for Goku to come!

63
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,050
I hate it myself, the same as you.

64
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,130
You've got to understand!

65
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,920
Damn...!

66
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:52,430
T-Ten-<i>san...</i>

67
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,140
Goku-<i>sa...</i>

68
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,430
T-Ten-<i>san</i>!

69
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,420
Damn. They've escaped, have they?

70
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,450
Can't you move?!

71
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,250
To think that I could possibly have
been hindered by the likes of you!

72
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,100
H-He'll be killed!

73
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,860
T-Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>!

74
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,860
Damn...

75
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,050
You look like you'll die even if I leave you be...

76
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,520
...but I'll eradicate you anyway!

77
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,240
F-Father!

78
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,000
W-What?!

79
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,040
Son Goku?

80
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,240
So you're Cell?

81
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,380
H-How did he just appear?

82
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,170
It looks as though you're one fantastic monster.

83
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,140
I'd like to settle everything right here,
but no matter how you shake it up,

84
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:49,900
there ain't no way I can win the way I am now.

85
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,980
However, just you wait one more day,

86
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,400
and I'll be sure to thoroughly
defeat you, you'll see!

87
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,740
Of all the things I would
have expected you to say!

88
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,580
After one day, you're going to
show me that you can defeat me?!

89
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,210
That's right!

90
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,210
In just one day, what is it
you're saying you can do, huh?

91
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:32,020
It's Piccolo's <i>ki</i>! Piccolo is still alive!

92
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,650
What?

93
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,530
Tenshinhan, don't you leave me!

94
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,460
There he is!

95
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,430
Hey, Piccolo! Stay with us!

96
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,350
H-How did those guys move...

97
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,350
...in that one instant?

98
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,190
Piccolo, Tenshinhan, both of
you are going to be all right now!

99
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,530
Once we get back to Kami-<i>sama</i>'s palace,

100
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,650
the senzu we got from Karin-<i>sama</i> will be there!

101
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,830
You're planning to run away?

102
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,080
That will not do, Son Goku!

103
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,720
They vanished!

104
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,190
That's a peculiar technique.

105
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,440
Son Goku, when did you
come up with that technique?

106
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,570
Well, right now that doesn't matter.

107
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,410
I have to catch No. 18.

108
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:12,250
Lousy gal, she couldn't have gotten too far away

109
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,120
together with the broken-down No. 16!

110
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,550
P-Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

111
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,770
Thank goodness you're alive!

112
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:37,230
Gohan, give them both a senzu!

113
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:37,810
Right!

114
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,990
It's Bulma-<i>san</i>!

115
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,340
What's the matter, Trunks?

116
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,260
Kuririn?! Where? Say, where is he?

117
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,980
You were right! Well done, Trunks!

118
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,240
Way to find him!

119
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,990
You really are gifted!

120
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,860
Just what you'd expect from any child of mine!

121
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,830
Bulma-<i>san</i>!

122
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,960
Bulma-<i>san</i>, please give me
the controller to shut down

123
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,830
the Artificial Humans right away!

124
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,830
I know!

125
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,040
Here it is!

126
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,010
This is the controller, huh?

127
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,180
However, you must get within ten
meters of them, or it will have no effect.

128
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,760
Don't forget that when you use it, okay?

129
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,180
T-Ten meters?

130
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,190
T-That's pretty close, huh?

131
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,360
Even so, I had to work very hard to make that!

132
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
I-I understand.

133
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,030
I'll be careful when using it.

134
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,490
And, besides that...

135
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:18,830
I had battle suits made for everyone,
the same as the kind Vegeta requested.

136
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,830
Will you take these
while you're at it?

137
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,830
They're light, but pretty tough!

138
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:26,210
It's Goku and the others that need those!

139
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,840
They should be at Kami-<i>sama</i>'s palace,

140
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,220
so Bulma-<i>san</i>, could
you take them there for us?

141
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,050
Kami-<i>sama</i>'s palace?

142
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,390
As I remember, that's way
above Karin-To Tower, right?

143
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,850
That's right!

144
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,350
Sure thing!

145
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,060
I'll take them there for you!

146
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,230
In return, Kuririn, you hang in there
and destroy the Artificial Humans, okay?

147
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,820
R-Right!

148
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,030
Well, let's fly on over to Kami-<i>sama</i>'s palace!

149
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,840
Damn. Where did that
miserable No. 18 disappear to?

150
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,160
Are you really all right,
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>?

151
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,750
Yeah! The senzu truly do work well!

152
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,750
Anyhow, Tenshinhan, you really were reckless, huh?

153
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,010
Really! I was worried too!

154
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,340
But thanks to you,
Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>, we got away...

155
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,760
...without No. 18 being
absorbed by Cell, and that's great!

156
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,020
Still, that monster Cell has an abnormal strength.

157
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,230
Frankly, no one is able to beat him.

158
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:56,900
Not even Vegeta. Not
even Goku. That's what I think.

159
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,330
Hey!

160
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:12,340
Goku! Vegeta and Trunks
about to come out of room!

161
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,750
Really?

162
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:17,070
<i>Vegeta and Trunks finally emerge.</i>

163
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,780
<i>Were they indeed able to surpass Super Saiyan?</i>

164
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,330
<i>Can they stop Cell's ambitions</i>
<i>to become his perfect form?</i>

165
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:47,520
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

166
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:53,350
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

167
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,730
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

168
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,200
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

169
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,750
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

170
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:14,830
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

171
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,340
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

172
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,960
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

173
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,470
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

174
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,600
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

175
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

176
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,440
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

177
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,110
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

178
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,280
<i>So sorry.</i>

179
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,410
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

180
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,420
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,850
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

182
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:17,020
<i>Wow, I'm blown away! Trunks,</i>
<i>you've really gotten all strong, huh?</i>

183
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,520
<i>I do indeed sense a different</i>
<i>sort of ki coming from them.</i>

184
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:24,030
<i>Does this mean that they have</i>
<i>gained a power greater than Cell has?</i>

185
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,030
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

186
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:30,330
<i>"I Will Dispose of Everything!!</i>
<i>A Reborn Vegeta, Father and Son, Sally Forth."</i>

187
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,700
<i>Ha, now it's our turn, right, Father?</i>

188
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,000
"Next time"
"I Will Dispose of Everything!!
A Reborn Vegeta, Father and Son, Sally Forth"
