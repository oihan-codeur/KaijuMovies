<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:24,715
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:30,015
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:36,735
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:43,325
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:52,205
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,245 --> 00:00:55,705
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,745 --> 00:01:04,715
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,755 --> 00:01:08,175
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:14,265
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:17,685
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,725 --> 00:01:26,615
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:37,085
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:38,995
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:56,225
<i>Goku and Gohan have gone</i>
<i>into training on the Earth's surface,</i>

17
00:01:56,265 --> 00:02:00,935
<i>whereby they rest for</i>
<i>three days, train for three days,</i>

18
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:02,815
<i>and then rest for three days, as Super Saiyans.</i>

19
00:02:09,365 --> 00:02:11,495
I will take you on now!

20
00:02:11,535 --> 00:02:13,705
<i>And, in the Heavenly Realm, Piccolo,</i>

21
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:17,705
<i>having entered the Room of</i>
<i>Spirit and Time for the first time,</i>

22
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:20,995
<i>was engaged in rigorous training as well.</i>

23
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:46,485
Be sure you defeat Cell for us!

24
00:02:46,525 --> 00:02:50,235
You're entering, aren't you?
Into this Tenkaichi Tournament?

25
00:02:54,285 --> 00:02:58,125
<i>Eight days remain until the Cell Games,</i>

26
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:01,125
<i>which have plunged all of Earth</i>
<i>into the depths of terror, are held.</i>

27
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:17,185
<i>"Hidden Power!!</i>
<i>When Gohan Was a Baby."</i>

28
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:22,435
I remember at the time, Yajirobe was like,

29
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:24,105
"Sorry 'bout that!

30
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:29,105
I-I got lotsa respect for ya!
Lemme be your friend!"

31
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:34,535
That's no good, Gohan.

32
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:38,455
You've got to control
your power just so, like me...

33
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:43,665
Whoops! I goofed,
I goofed! But not this time...!

34
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:53,675
Oh, man...

35
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:05,605
You gotta be kiddin' me!!

36
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,355
I don't care if it's because
you're goin' to fight Cell or not,

37
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:12,025
when you're eatin' at least,
stop bein' Super Saiyan!

38
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:13,655
At this rate, no matter
however many place settin's–

39
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:16,035
no, however many houses we
may have–it won't be enough!

40
00:04:16,075 --> 00:04:19,575
This afternoon, I was meanin' to
have a birthday party for Gohan!

41
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:21,455
Why are you doin' this to me?!

42
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:23,045
Birthday party?

43
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:26,625
But Mother, today isn't my birthday...

44
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:29,045
I know that!

45
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:30,675
But even so, listen.

46
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:33,385
When you were in that
Room of Spirit and Time place,

47
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:36,215
Gohan-chan turned 11 years old!

48
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:40,725
Birthdays are important milestones and all.

49
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:43,725
I decided that we were
goin' to celebrate it today.

50
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:48,605
Now, Goku-<i>sa</i>, you go on out.

51
00:04:48,645 --> 00:04:50,945
G-Go? Go where?

52
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:53,575
While I'm gettin' ready for the party,

53
00:04:53,615 --> 00:04:56,945
I couldn't stand it if you
broke anythin' else on me.

54
00:04:56,985 --> 00:05:00,615
Go catch us a huge fish
or somethin' for the party.

55
00:05:00,655 --> 00:05:02,125
I get you.

56
00:05:02,165 --> 00:05:04,455
If that's the case, I guess I'll be off.

57
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:05,625
I'll go too!

58
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:07,625
Father, me too.

59
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:11,465
Gohan-<i>chan</i>, you'll stay here studyin'.

60
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:15,845
Until the party begins,
you study good and hard!

61
00:05:15,885 --> 00:05:18,595
After all, you've fallen
behind a whole year's worth!

62
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,595
Even though it's my birthday?

63
00:05:20,635 --> 00:05:23,015
Your birthday's got nothin' to do with it!

64
00:05:23,055 --> 00:05:25,015
B-But...

65
00:05:25,055 --> 00:05:26,605
Gohan...

66
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:31,815
Your mother's right. You stay here and study.

67
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:43,075
W-What?

68
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,035
G-Goku!

69
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,625
Father!

70
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,625
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

71
00:05:52,005 --> 00:05:54,255
You don't have a fever...

72
00:06:07,475 --> 00:06:12,025
Great, great! It sounds like
he's studyin' nice and hard.

73
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:15,155
But still, what has come over Goku-<i>sa</i>?

74
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:17,195
He's never once before told him to study,

75
00:06:17,235 --> 00:06:20,035
or anythin' else a father might say.

76
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,035
It's kind of spooky, huh?

77
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:24,955
I hope it doesn't start snowin' red snow next.

78
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:30,835
Yahoo!

79
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:51,525
Goku is romping around like a little kid!

80
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:53,605
Hey, Kuririn!

81
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,025
Here!

82
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,625
You know, Goku...

83
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:17,925
It would have been nice if
Gohan could have come too.

84
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:21,635
Chichi-<i>san</i> doesn't have anything
else in her mind except for studying.

85
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:24,975
On top of that, after having
even you tell him to study like that,

86
00:07:25,015 --> 00:07:27,805
I feel sorry for Gohan.

87
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:30,645
It's all right.

88
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:39,485
In eight days, me and
Gohan have to go fight Cell.

89
00:07:41,065 --> 00:07:43,285
Cell is ridiculously strong.

90
00:07:43,325 --> 00:07:47,455
To be honest, it's a fight I ain't sure we can win.

91
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:52,375
So, during the time until then,

92
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:55,705
I want to allow Gohan
to be together with Chichi.

93
00:07:58,005 --> 00:07:59,255
<i>Goku...</i>

94
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:02,925
Let's see...

95
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:07,015
I'm sure I put that tablecloth
away in here somewhere...

96
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:09,605
Where is it, where is it?

97
00:08:09,645 --> 00:08:11,345
Yow!

98
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:14,605
What's this?

99
00:08:20,655 --> 00:08:24,825
Wow! This sure takes me back!

100
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:33,245
He's gotten a lot bigger now,

101
00:08:33,285 --> 00:08:35,795
but there was a time when he was like this, too.

102
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:43,465
He's so cute.

103
00:08:43,505 --> 00:08:46,475
But ain't he awful tiny?

104
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:49,515
Babies are supposed to be tiny.

105
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:55,525
Um... w-we oughtta be givin'
him a name before too long, huh?

106
00:08:55,565 --> 00:08:58,275
I've already thought up a name for him.

107
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:02,605
Y-You've already thought of one?

108
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:06,035
Einstein.

109
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:08,455
–Einstein?
–Einstein?

110
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:12,455
That's a fantastic name for a scholar!

111
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:13,665
Huh?

112
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:20,465
There, there. That's better.

113
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:23,465
I'm sure he's not fond of that name.

114
00:09:23,505 --> 00:09:27,595
Oh, no! Well, Archimedes is okay, too.

115
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:32,435
That's no good either.

116
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:36,015
Well then, what do you think is good, Pa?

117
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:39,225
I thought up a whole mess of them!

118
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:43,025
See?

119
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,615
Here goes! Ready?

120
00:09:47,655 --> 00:09:54,535
Gyumataro... Gyumahiko...
Doctor Gyuma... Gyumanosuke...

121
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:59,665
Gyumashin... Gyumantohihi... Gyumasuki...!

122
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:03,965
Pa, yours aren't any good either.

123
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,755
No good, huh?

124
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,395
That's right...!

125
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:28,535
Me?

126
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:31,655
Goku-<i>sa</i>, haven't you thought of any names?

127
00:10:31,695 --> 00:10:33,865
You've got some, right? At least one?

128
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:36,575
I...

129
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:40,665
I...

130
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:47,385
I'm hungry!

131
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:52,885
Goku-<i>sa</i>!

132
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:56,855
What are you talkin' about,
here at an important time like this?!

133
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,015
We just ate <i>asagohan</i> a little while ago!
[<i>asagohan</i>: breakfast]

134
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:05,315
I mean really! You're not a child!

135
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:07,365
Can't you wait until <i>hirugohan</i>?!
[<i>hirugohan</i>: lunch]

136
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,825
Sorry, sorry...

137
00:11:12,575 --> 00:11:14,955
Goku-<i>sa</i>, you're always like this!

138
00:11:14,995 --> 00:11:16,375
Oh, Chichi!

139
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:17,375
What?!

140
00:11:17,415 --> 00:11:19,955
Uh, listen to this for a sec!

141
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:21,625
<i>Asagohan</i>!

142
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:24,835
<i>Hirugohan</i>!

143
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:28,255
Gohan!

144
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,675
Gohan...?

145
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:42,525
That's it! This guy wants
to have Grandpa's name!

146
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:44,735
I'm sure that's gotta be it.

147
00:11:44,775 --> 00:11:47,315
If you wanna give him
the name of my fellow pupil,

148
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:49,525
Son Gohan, I got no complaints.

149
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:54,655
All right! You're Gohan! Son Gohan!

150
00:11:56,575 --> 00:12:01,665
So, you're happy about
that too, Gohan? Son Gohan!

151
00:12:09,085 --> 00:12:10,885
Goku-<i>sa...</i>

152
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:20,555
Gohan!

153
00:12:24,645 --> 00:12:27,445
You don't have to study any more today!

154
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:28,905
What are you doin'?!

155
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:31,815
Hurry up and go help Goku-<i>sa</i>!

156
00:12:33,075 --> 00:12:34,155
Right!

157
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:56,135
Currently, I am extremely scared!

158
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,975
However, today I will gather my courage,

159
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:03,225
and literally put my life at risk,
in order to bring you this report.

160
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,185
Ladies and gentlemen, please watch.

161
00:13:05,225 --> 00:13:07,025
That person over there is he

162
00:13:07,065 --> 00:13:11,195
who is now the topic of conversation
throughout the world, Cell.

163
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:15,115
Why did I take this job, anyway?

164
00:13:15,155 --> 00:13:18,195
When all of humanity could be
destroyed in eight days anyhow,

165
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:21,455
what will it gain me to go to my grave now?

166
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:24,085
However, I've realized this too late.

167
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,085
It's all hopeless. I can only keep going.

168
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:37,095
I'm scared, all right!

169
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:42,095
Ladies and gentlemen,

170
00:13:42,135 --> 00:13:46,015
just in case something happens,
let me wish you my final farewells.

171
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:48,025
Hurry it up!

172
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:48,525
Right...

173
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:58,075
Cell-<i>san</i>, please excuse me a moment.

174
00:13:58,115 --> 00:14:01,205
Uh, where is it that you come from?

175
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:06,625
Are the rumors that you came
here in a UFO from deep space true?

176
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:08,625
What is your true goal
in holding the Cell Games?

177
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:11,335
If all of the representatives lose to you,

178
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,635
which of Earth's districts
will you begin destroying first?

179
00:14:13,675 --> 00:14:16,255
If humans were to escape into space in a rocket,

180
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:18,635
would you chase them down and kill them?

181
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,265
You are annoying scum.

182
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:38,115
And you're in my way.

183
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:04,225
I-It's huge!

184
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:06,435
I wonder if this will do.

185
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:11,315
Sorry, but would you share
some of your fruit with us?

186
00:15:40,675 --> 00:15:43,055
Okay, that's enough, Goku!

187
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:08,115
Bravo, bravo!

188
00:16:43,065 --> 00:16:45,825
Wow, how pretty!

189
00:16:51,165 --> 00:16:54,835
Look there, Gohan-<i>chan</i>! There's some birds!

190
00:16:56,165 --> 00:17:00,125
Parents and child, three of them. Just like us.

191
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:03,215
You're right.

192
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,555
There, did you see them, Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

193
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:15,645
Oh, no!

194
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:23,195
Wait up!

195
00:17:37,245 --> 00:17:39,125
Gohan!

196
00:17:41,085 --> 00:17:44,005
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

197
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:57,435
G-Gohan-<i>chan</i>! Goku-<i>sa,</i>
don't dilly-dally, stop him!

198
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:11,995
Whoops...!

199
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:57,285
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

200
00:19:00,665 --> 00:19:02,125
Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

201
00:19:05,675 --> 00:19:08,045
You're not hurt anywhere?

202
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:14,935
Thank goodness!

203
00:19:14,975 --> 00:19:19,645
Your father saved you!
That's your father for you!

204
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,225
No, it wasn't me...

205
00:19:21,265 --> 00:19:25,065
It's great that you saved him, but Goku-<i>sa,</i>

206
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:27,815
it was wrong of you to be lettin'
go of the handrail in the first place!

207
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,785
If you hadn't been lucky,
he could have gotten killed!

208
00:19:30,825 --> 00:19:33,195
If you aren't more careful,
there's gonna be trouble, you know!

209
00:19:33,235 --> 00:19:35,195
S-Sorry.

210
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:40,875
Come on, Gohan-<i>chan</i>, let's
just ignore this awful father

211
00:19:40,915 --> 00:19:42,205
and go home together with your mother, okay?

212
00:19:42,245 --> 00:19:44,005
Ah, Chichi!

213
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:53,305
Sorry about that, making
a hole and everything...

214
00:19:57,595 --> 00:20:00,565
Father, let's go home.

215
00:20:00,605 --> 00:20:01,565
Yeah, right.

216
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:05,525
I'm sure there's an
incredible feast waiting for us!

217
00:20:05,565 --> 00:20:07,395
I'm so hungry!

218
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:13,235
Gohan-<i>chan</i>, congratulations
on your 11th birthday.

219
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:15,905
"Happy Birthday"
Congratulations!

220
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:21,955
Thanks!

221
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:25,835
I brought you a heap of presents, Gohan!

222
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:30,965
Wow, incredible! Thanks, Grandpa Gyumao!

223
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,305
Now then, Gohan-<i>chan,</i>

224
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:34,965
first you have to blow out
the candles on your cake.

225
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:36,555
Great!

226
00:20:36,595 --> 00:20:39,145
Be sure to make a wish!

227
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:40,475
Right.

228
00:21:11,585 --> 00:21:16,845
Gohan, looks like you still
can't control your power, huh?

229
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:24,565
Gohan...!

230
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:26,975
Mother, I'm sorry.

231
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:40,915
What's the use?

232
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:43,415
You are Goku-<i>sa</i>'s child, after all.

233
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:09,065
<i>Goku and Chichi have warmly</i>
<i>watched over Gohan's development.</i>

234
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:15,025
<i>And Gohan has also felt the</i>
<i>deep affection held by both of them.</i>

235
00:22:15,065 --> 00:22:23,915
<i>However, will Goku and Gohan be able</i>
<i>to preserve peaceful times such as these?</i>

236
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:27,125
<i>Seven days remain until</i>
<i>the Cell games are held.</i>

237
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:48,395
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

238
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:54,235
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

239
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:56,605
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

240
00:23:00,075 --> 00:23:05,115
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

241
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:11,625
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

242
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:15,715
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

243
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:19,215
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

244
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:21,845
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

245
00:23:23,595 --> 00:23:29,395
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

246
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,485
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

247
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,275
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

248
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:39,325
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

249
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:44,995
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

250
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:47,165
<i>So sorry.</i>

251
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:52,285
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

252
00:23:55,045 --> 00:24:00,295
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

253
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:14,025
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

254
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:16,985
<i>The army is launching an</i>
<i>all-out attack against Cell?</i>

255
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:19,405
<i>Stop! You'll just be killed for no reason!</i>

256
00:24:19,445 --> 00:24:22,115
<i>Say, Goku-sa, is there no</i>
<i>way that you can bring back</i>

257
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:24,535
<i>Kami-sama and the Dragon Balls?</i>

258
00:24:24,575 --> 00:24:26,495
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

259
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:29,995
<i>"Seek Out Kami-sama!!</i>
<i>Goku's Great Instantaneous Movement."</i>

260
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:33,745
<i>Father, you can Instantaneously</i>
<i>Move through outer space?</i>

261
00:24:34,205 --> 00:24:37,715
"Next time"
"Seek Out Kami-<i>sama</i>!!
Goku's Great Instantaneous Movement"
