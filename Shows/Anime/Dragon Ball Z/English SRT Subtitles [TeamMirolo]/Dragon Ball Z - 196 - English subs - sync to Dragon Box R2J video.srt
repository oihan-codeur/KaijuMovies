And he sent Cell flying in the blink of an eye!

21
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,710
Paikuhan is really awesome!

22
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,300
Okay, I get it, I get it.

23
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,140
I'm just saying, he's really strong.

24
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,760
Paikuhan isn't the only one who's strong.

25
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,350
Hey, you guys!

26
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,270
You called, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

27
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,720
This is a newcomer, Son Goku.
He's pleased to meet you.

28
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,140
Pleased to meet you.

29
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,520
Goku, these are the martial
artists from the North Galaxy.

30
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,480
That means, they are your seniors.

31
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:26,440
Migoren here fought bravely
against fiendish aliens 700 years ago.

32
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,120
Sate defended his home planet from a
collision with a meteor 3500 years ago.

33
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,960
And, like you, Olivue here came from Earth,

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,130
and he is still immortalized
as a hero in mythology.

35
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,720
Everyone else here was an outstanding
martial artist when they were alive.

36
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,930
These mighty men have been
training here for many thousands of years,

37
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:59,060
in order that Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i> might train them.

38
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,150
You've got to train that much
before Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i> will train you?

39
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,480
That's right.

40
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,160
Only those who Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>
considers qualified receive that honor.

41
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,320
Is that so?

42
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,200
The Next World isn't going to be all that easy.

43
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:26,710
Kaio of the North has died!
Kaio of the North has died!

44
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,720
Kaio of the North has died!
He's gone and died, after all!

45
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,300
W-What's this...?!

46
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,140
Kaio of the North has died!

47
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,020
What a happy occasion!

48
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,310
It's not a happy occasion!

49
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,320
And what are all of you here together for?!

50
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,360
I called them here.

51
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,070
After all, a Kaio has died,
and they've got to see this!

52
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,490
Positively!

53
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,660
We'll have a big blowout to commemorate it!

54
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,290
You don't have to make any fuss!

55
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,290
Who is that together with
the Kaio-<i>sama</i> of the West?

56
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,300
They're both Kaio-<i>sama</i>, as well.

57
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:13,220
Kaio-<i>sama</i> of the South,
and Kaio-<i>sama</i> of the East.

58
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,140
There sure are a lot of Kaio-<i>sama</i>, ain't there?

59
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,060
There are four galaxies, you see,

60
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,470
divided into north, south, east, and west.

61
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,320
Above them, you've got Hell,
and the Serpentine Road,

62
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,150
and then far above them,
there are the four Kaio's Worlds,

63
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:35,740
from which each of the Kaio watch
over the galaxies they preside over.

64
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,990
And then, higher than the Kaio's
Worlds, higher even than heaven,

65
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,490
is Grand Kaio's World here.

66
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,920
So that's how This World and
the Next World are made up, huh?

67
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,050
I didn't know any of that.

68
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,550
We found out about it for the
first time when we died, too.

69
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,140
What do you know, you really are dead, huh?

70
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,310
You don't have to keep
saying that, you pesky old biddy!

71
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,730
What did you call me?! Just you say that again!

72
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:11,150
Hold on! Now, now, you
two, calm down, calm down!

73
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,820
Never mind all that, for
the first time in 300 years,

74
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,320
all four Kaio are here together.

75
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,910
How about after all this time,

76
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,740
we hold a martial arts tournament
between the four galaxies?

77
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,040
A tournament?

78
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,960
An Anoyoichi Tournament?
[Anoyoichi: Best of the Next World]

79
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,130
Nice idea there, Kaio-<i>chan</i> of the West.

80
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,300
Yes, sir! Thank you very much!

81
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:41,010
In that case, I will personally
give lessons to whoever wins.

82
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,730
R-Really?! You will, Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>?!

83
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,150
Personally?

84
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,650
Give lessons?

85
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,650
Well, is it okay if you ain't
been training for a long time?

86
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,150
I've never even hoped for such a chance.

87
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,690
It's like a dream.

88
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,160
You know something, it's been a long
time since we've had a tournament.

89
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,160
I know! Everyone, come on...!

90
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,450
In here.

91
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,320
This will be just right for our arena, won't it?

92
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,740
Incredible!

93
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,330
Magnificent!

94
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,750
Positively!

95
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,880
A-All right! I'm going to go at it and win this!

96
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,790
And what's more, I'm going to
have Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i> train me!

97
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,720
Just a minute, you!
You're thinking of participating?

98
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
Of course I am.

99
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,720
For someone so new, you shouldn't
think so little of the Next World!

100
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,390
Kaio of the East, Goku may be a
newcomer, but he has considerable power.

101
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,280
If you're willing to say that much,
how about I give him a test?

102
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,540
If you can beat me in a race,

103
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,500
I will approve your
participation in the tournament.

104
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,040
Here we go again...

105
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,460
Positively...

106
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,630
Kaio of the East always wants to race,
for whatever reason she can come up with.

107
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,050
That's okay, isn't it?

108
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:28,220
Let's let them do it. I love this fun stuff.

109
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,270
It's starting! It's starting!
I'm starting to get fired up!

110
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,530
Good luck in there, Goku.

111
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,240
That biddy is the last person I want to lose to.

112
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,540
We'll let the end of this training
ground be the finish line. Ready?

113
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,040
You betcha!

114
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,670
Hang in there, Goku!

115
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,050
Go when I say!

116
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,890
Ready...!

117
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,610

118

<i>This youngster's not too bad, is he?</i>

119
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,050

It looks like they're running pretty fast.

<i>It's just about time, I guess...</i>

124

Geez! What a persistent boy you are!

125
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,570
That's the finish line!

126
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,090
Hii!

...o-<i>sama</i>!

The winner is...

131
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,940
I made it!

132
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,940
...me!

133
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,110
Eh? You can't mean it!

134
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,780
It's clear to anyone that was watching, right?

135
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,110
I got here all the way from that distant doorway.

136
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,450
You can't mean it!

137
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,950
Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>, I didn't
know that you were participating!

138
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,240
I never said I wasn't participating.

"Kaio of the North Dying Commemorative
Anoyoichi Tournament"

140
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,650
I'm impressed by you Kaio-<i>chan</i>
folks. You built us a fine ring.

141
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,370
Listen up! If you lose, you'll pay for it!

142
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,960
You're our top contender.
Give it your all, Paikuhan!

143
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,500
Of course.

144
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,510
Paikuhan is entering, too? Wow, I'm so excited!

145
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,050
This fight is going to be a bit different for you

146
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,930
than any Tenkaichi Tournament
you've ever been in before.

147
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:40,520
Be careful how you go about this.

148
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,100
Right.

149
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,520
Ladies and gentlemen, we
apologize for the terribly long wait.

150
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:54,280
We now convene the Kaio of the North
Dying Commemorative Anoyoichi Tournament!

151
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,950
And so, to begin with, we will hear a
word of welcome from the Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

152
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,120
All of you here, today, we hold
a tournament after a long absence.

153
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,250
To those of you who are fighting, as well
as those of you who are cheering them on,

154
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:09,130
let's all have an enjoyable time of it!

155
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,260
Thank you very much. Now then,
allow us to explain the rules.

156
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,520
There are four entrants from each galaxy,

157
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,940
and their pairings were
determined earlier by lottery.

158
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,940
This is how it will be determined!

159
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,110
The contests will be one-game
matches, without any time restriction.

160
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,940
Falling out of the ring,

161
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,530
crying,

162
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,120
or saying you give up constitutes a loss.

163
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,120
Further, blinding strikes,

164
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,540
strikes to critical areas, and other
such dirty moves are not allowed.

165
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,790
There is no need to worry about
anyone in the Anoyoichi Tournament dying.

166
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,840
You're already dead, after all!

167
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,260
And so, everyone, let's all
please have a good, safe fight!

168
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,220
The winner will receive,
of all things, some private,

169
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:06,430
one-on-one coaching from Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>!

170
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,650
I think I'd rather have something
yummy to eat, instead of private coaching.

171
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,950
Stop horsing around!

172
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,820
Do you want to be the winner?!

173
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,040
Do you want to train with Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>?!

174
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,250
Are you sure of yourselves?!

175
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:35,090
Okay then, we'll move right
on ahead to the first match.

176
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,510
First off, we have Contestant
Olivue, from the North Galaxy,

177
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,720
and Contestant Chapchai, from the East Galaxy!

178
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,540
Win, no matter what! You got that?!

179
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,290
Hang in there, Olivue!

180
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:13,380
The guys from the East Galaxy
have great speed! Watch out!

181
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,520
<i>He's fast!</i>

182
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,770
Oh, my! This is incredible!

183
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,110
Due to his extreme speed,

184
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,230
it looks like Contestant Chapchai
has a number of different bodies!

185
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,320
The <i>Zanzo-ken</i> technique?!

186
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,390
Ah! How can this be?!
Contestant Chapchai divided himself!

187
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,510
However, ironically, it proved to be his downfall!

188
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,100
Contestant Olivue wins!

189
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,430
What's the deal with this guy?

190
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,960
And now, from the North Galaxy,
a new face, Contestant Son Goku,

191
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,970
and, from the South Galaxy,
the formidable Contestant Caterpi!

192
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,510
What kind of fight will this turn out to be?!

193
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,370
Watch yourself, Goku!

194
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,710
Oh, crap!

195
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,510
You're finished now!

196
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,130
Goku!

197
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,330
Contestant Caterpi launches a tickle attack!

198
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,200
How sneaky! How utterly sneaky!

199
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:01,250
Now, say you give up!

200
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,430
The South Galaxy is a peaceful one...

201
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,430
You give up? Sure you do! Say it!

202
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,270
I can't let myself say it!

203
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:46,460
Y-You're remarkably weak, huh?

204
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:53,300
What? How dare you say that!
All right, if that's how you want it...!

205
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,180
You'll be sorry afterward!

206
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,310
I don't think I will be.

207
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,940
What could this be?!

208
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,110
Contestant Caterpi has started to transform!

209
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,880
W-What is that?

210
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,840
He's turned into a chrysalis!

211
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,260
Caterpi is transforming into his ultimate form!

212
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,510
K-Kaio of the South, if I could ask,

213
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:41,390
when will Contestant Caterpi
hatch from his chrysalis?

214
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:47,110
In about 1200 years, I would say.

215
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,870
I-I can't wait that long!

216
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:03,250
I-I can't wait, either. Son Goku wins this match!

217
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,510
W-What just happened?

218
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:16,930
<i>At last, the tournament in</i>
<i>the Next World had begun.</i>

219
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,520
<i>Will Goku be able to advance his way up?</i>

220
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:27,270
<i>Goku could not even guess what kind</i>
<i>of opponents he would face from here on.</i>

221
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,210
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

222
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:54,050
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

223
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,430
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

224
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,930
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

225
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,440
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

226
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,530
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

227
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:19,030
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

228
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,660
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

229
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:29,210
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

230
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,300
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

231
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,090
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

232
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:39,140
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

233
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:44,810
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

234
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,980
<i>So sorry.</i>

235
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:52,110
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

236
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,110
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

237
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,710
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

238
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,970
<i>Whoo, everybody's got their</i>
<i>awesome techniques, huh?</i>

239
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,630
<i>The Next World is a big place, all right.</i>

240
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,600
<i>This is no time for you to be gawking.</i>

241
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,100
<i>You're up next against my boy Aqua, you know.</i>

242
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,890
<i>Don't blame me if he beats you to tears!</i>

243
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,850
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

244
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,060
<i>"Grand Kaio's World Gone Wild!!</i>
<i>Goku Kicks Up a Whirlwind."</i>

245
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,480
<i>Father, show them your power!</i>

246
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,740
"Next time"
"Grand Kaio's World Gone Wild!!
Goku Kicks Up a Whirlwind"
