1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,520
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,830
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,140
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,450
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:52,320
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,830
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:04,840
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,310
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,820
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:26,730
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,330
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,200
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,110
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,430
<i>Gohan was desperately trying to</i>
<i>endure Piccolo's harsh style of training.</i>

17
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,120
<i>Tenshinhan and the others had</i>
<i>finished their training in the Heavenly Realm,</i>

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,760
<i>and had each returned to the lower</i>
<i>realm to prepare for battle in their own way.</i>

19
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,330
<i>And Goku was learning the Kaio-ken technique</i>

20
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,970
<i>from Kaio-sama himself</i>
<i>at a surprisingly quick pace.</i>

21
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,500
<i>Two days remained until the Saiyans arrive.</i>

22
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,540
<i>"Come Forth, Shen Long!</i>
<i>The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth."</i>

23
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,530
This will be the last day of your training.

24
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,160
Your joke studies might
have been a little lacking,

25
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,540
but I think I've taught you the gist of it.

26
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,170
Let's review everything
up to now. Try it all out.

27
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,520
First up, Bubbles...

28
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,360
Ready!

29
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Start!

30
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,400
0.8 seconds! That's a new record!

31
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,740
Next up, Gregory...

32
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,970
Right!

33
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,650
Ready!

34
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,720
Start!

35
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,750
Here I go!

36
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,420
Huh?

37
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,460
1.2 seconds!

38
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,830
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

39
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,270
Okay, what's next?

40
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,070
All right! Last up, the <i>Genki Dama</i> check.

41
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,580
I've been waiting for this!

42
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,120
All right, ready, Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

43
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,970
Okay then, here goes!

44
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,970
Try locking onto this
giant brick at super-speed.

45
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,400
Okay! Super-speed!

46
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,130
No trouble at all!

47
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,330
Nicely done, Son Goku.

48
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,740
I honestly didn't think you'd be able
to handle the <i>Genki Dama</i> as well as this.

49
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,370
I really worked hard at it!

50
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,940
I know it's tedious hearing this so many times,

51
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,740
but the <i>Genki Dama</i>
is a technique that takes

52
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,340
all of the <i>Genki</i> energy from grass and trees,

53
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,750
from people and animals,

54
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,720
and even things and the
atmosphere, and allocates a little bit

55
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,320
from each of their energies,
concentrates it, and shoots it.

56
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,730
Even a <i>Genki Dama</i>
from a planet as small as this

57
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,290
had that kind of destructive force.

58
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,360
The Earth, where you'll be fighting,

59
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,570
is so much larger than this
planet, it doesn't even compare.

60
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,070
You can also harness the
support of the sun's enormous energy.

61
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:52,740
It will be a <i>Genki Dama</i> of
incredible power. If you slip up,

62
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,780
it wouldn't be too hard to destroy
the very planet you're trying to protect.

63
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,750
If you can help it, don't use it at all,

64
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:06,730
although I will permit you to use it one time,
if there's nothing else you can do. Got it?

65
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,300
Got it! I'm sure I can manage
using just the <i>Kaio-ken</i> technique!

66
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,970
That's it! The day of battle is nearly at hand.

67
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,980
The Saiyans will land on Earth tomorrow.

68
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,140
Oh, hell!

69
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,150
W-What?! What's wrong?!

70
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,510
Well, it's just that–I didn't
figure the time it would take

71
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,950
for you to go down the Serpentine
Road again into my calculations.

72
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:39,320
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>, you mean you can't send
me whooshing back to the Lower Realm?!

73
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,760
No...

74
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,300
I-I have to travel back down that road again?!

75
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,770
It took me all of half
a year just to come here!

76
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,300
Well, as you are now,
you can get there in two days.

77
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,470
I'll tell Earth's Kami
to come and pick you up.

78
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,140
That will still be a day too late!
Everyone will be killed!

79
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,980
Stop your griping!
Even I make mistakes sometimes!

80
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,320
Now, hurry and tell your friends on Earth

81
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,390
to use those Dragon Ball things
to have you brought back to life!

82
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,960
Tell them?! How?!

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,730
Put one of your hands on my back,
and speak to them inside your mind.

84
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,330
That will get through to them.

85
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,360
R-Really?

86
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,370
–Like this?
–Hurry and tell them!

87
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:35,180
O-Old Timer! It's Goku!
Can you hear me? Hey, Old Timer!

88
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,890
Nice! What a hot gal!

89
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,300
G-Goku?! Goku, is that you?!
W-Where are you?! Where are you?!

90
00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:00,040
He heard me! Old Timer,
I'm still in the Next World.

91
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm talking to you with my mind from here.

92
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,680
The Next World?

93
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,520
Have you gotten all
the Dragon Balls together?

94
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,720
Y-Yeah. We've had them together
for a while now, just to save you.

95
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,960
We all searched for them like mad.

96
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,730
Thanks! So, I hate to ask,
but could you summon Shen Long,

97
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,670
and get me brought back to life?

98
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,300
The Saiyans are going to be on Earth tomorrow!

99
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,740
W-What?!

100
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,310
T-Tomorrow, already? That's a
whole month sooner than we thought.

101
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,650
Hurry, Old Timer.

102
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:45,180
I'm going to be a little late, but
I promise you, I'll manage something!

103
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,890
Hey, Goku!

104
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,430
Um, you're hurting me...

105
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,590
I'm sorry!

106
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:00,070
A-All right, you got it!
By the way, Goku, how did it go?

107
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,270
I heard you were training there
in the Next World. How did that turn out?

108
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,340
Fantastic!

109
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,450
That's a relief to hear.

110
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,450
Hey, is he all right?

111
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,650
Old Man Turtle Hermit is
muttering to himself in the bathroom.

112
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,990
I wonder if he's gone senile...

113
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,690
Hey! Get the Dragon Balls ready, now!

114
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,200
That was amazing, Kaio<i>-sama</i>!
I got right through to him!

115
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,040
Well, sure you did.

116
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,940
I can finally come back to life.

117
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,650
All right. Now, while you're
waiting to be brought back to life,

118
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,380
let me do something about
those heavy, tattered clothes of yours.

119
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,520
Really?

120
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,360
Awesome! They've gotten lighter!

121
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:10,330
They're not just lighter; they're made
from a wonderfully hard-wearing fabric.

122
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,340
It will even deflect your more minor attacks.

123
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,750
Thank you, Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

124
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,310
Terrific! The "turtle"
mark is still in its place!

125
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,350
I was worried that my clothes
would look ugly, like yours, Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

126
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,280
Well, excuse me.

127
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,760
I hope they bring me back to life soon!

128
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:39,400
The mark on your back is the
most stylish point on the outfit, right?

129
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,200
Yeah!

130
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,320
What's wrong with you?! You can't
defeat your enemy by just dodging him!

131
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:32,160
<i>Oh, no! I must have</i>
<i>inadvertently hit him a little too hard.</i>

132
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,100
That's not fair. You said
you wouldn't use your eyes.

133
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,700
Don't be presumptuous! You think that
sort of promise is valid when you're fighting?!

134
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:53,480
But Piccolo<i>-san</i>, you're not the enemy.

135
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,620
Okay... come forth, Shen Long!

136
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,420
It's the middle of the day,
yet suddenly it's gotten dark!

137
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,530
Don't touch me!

138
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,530
N-No matter how many times
you see it, it's still scary, huh?

139
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,590
Speak forth thy wish.
I shall grant thee any one wish.

140
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,760
S-Say, um, asking for you to
defeat the Saiyans and save the Earth...

141
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,470
would be useless for us to wish for, huh?

142
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,340
What are you talking about?!
Do you mean to let Son<i>-kun</i> stay dead?!

143
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,940
I-It's not that!

144
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,940
It would be simpler this way, and we
could always wish Goku back the next time!

145
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,680
That wish is not possible.
I was created of Kami.

146
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,060
As such, I cannot grant a
wish that surpasses Kami's power.

147
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,630
Then, please bring Son Goku back to life.

148
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,330
That will be an easy wish to grant.

149
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,830
<i>Son Goku is about to come back to life, huh?</i>

150
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,930
<i>Which would mean that the Saiyans</i>
<i>are coming sooner than we expected!</i>

151
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,140
All right! The ring over your
head has vanished! You're alive again!

152
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,880
They did it!

153
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,650
–Move quickly!
–Right!

154
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,150
Remember, your foes are villains who
are more powerful than you can imagine.

155
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,750
They won't allow you to be
careless for even an instant.

156
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,760
You can't go thinking you can
always be brought back to life again!

157
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,760
That's okay. You can only be brought
back to life with the Dragon Balls once.

158
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,390
I'm going to go at them
as hard as I can! Watch me!

159
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,170
Thanks for everything, Kaio<i>-sama</i>!
If I die, I'll come see you again.

160
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,200
Bubbles!

161
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,710
Gregory!

162
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,710
Take care!

163
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,740
Bye, now!

164
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,430
Bye!

165
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,510
That guy must have bottomless strength!

166
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,250
And yet, his heart is clearer than crystal.

167
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,380
To think that there's a guy
like that in the Lower Realm...

168
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,560
He has become even stronger
than you, hasn't he, Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

169
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,330
Still, his sense of humor was lacking somewhat.

170
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:13,570
Next time he comes here,
I'll train him more on that.

171
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,740
Whoo! So light, so light!

172
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,450
My body feels as light as downy fluff!

173
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:33,780
<i>That's right!</i>

174
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:38,420
<i>This ain't any time to be</i>
<i>impressed! I've got to hurry!</i>

175
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:47,530
<i>And so, the next day,</i>
<i>at 1 1:43 in the morning,</i>

176
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:53,480
<i>the Earth at last yielded</i>
<i>itself to the two Saiyans' incursion.</i>

177
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,530
Papa, I'm hungry.

178
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,030
Is it that late already?

179
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,850
W-What was that?

180
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,480
What happened?

181
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,050
T-This is a surprise!

182
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,760
It looks like something fell down here!

183
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,330
T-That's it, all right!
That round thing fell down here!

184
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,200
There's one over here, too!

185
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,530
It's a person!

186
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,470
There's a person coming out of it!

187
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,200
Over here, too!

188
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,440
It's a person!

189
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,700
W-What the–?

190
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,560
So, the Saiyans have finally come.

191
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,490
Their <i>ki</i> is enormous, huh, Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

192
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,170
T-Ten<i>-san...</i>

193
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,610
They're here a lot sooner than we thought.

194
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,540
<i>At last, the dreaded day had arrived.</i>

195
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,800
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

196
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,680
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

197
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,050
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

198
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,550
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

199
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,030
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

200
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:14,130
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

201
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,640
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

202
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,300
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

203
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:27,820
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

204
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:31,880
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

205
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,720
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

206
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,790
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

207
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,460
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

208
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,630
<i>So sorry.</i>

209
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:50,730
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

210
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,710
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

211
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,590
<i>Heya!</i>

212
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,490
<i>The mighty Saiyans</i>
<i>have finally arrived on Earth!</i>

213
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:17,160
<i>Guys, hang in there until I get there!</i>

214
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,760
<i>Don't worry. We've gotten so much stronger,</i>

215
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,600
<i>we don't compare to what we were a year ago.</i>

216
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,400
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

217
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,710
<i>"Unbelievable! Saibaimen, Born of the Soil."</i>

218
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:32,480
<i>Kuririn-san, you're going</i>
<i>to fight alongside us, right?</i>

219
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,580
"Next time"
"Unbelievable! Saibaimen, Born of the Soil"
