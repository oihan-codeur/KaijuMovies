Wait!

00:02:53,105 --> 00:02:57,035
Very well. We will wait
until Kakarrot gets here.

25
00:02:57,075 --> 00:03:02,035
However, only for three hours.
We won't wait any longer than that.

<i>"An Intense Three-Hour Delay!</i>
<i>The Kinto Un Bullet-Express."</i>

W-Why do we have to wait for Kakarrot?!

28
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:48,455
Because he is a traitor to us Saiyans.

29
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:55,595
We have to punish traitors.
We're going to kill his son and his friends...

30
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,625
...right before his eyes.

31
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:02,665
After that, we're going to
deal with him, nice and slow.

32
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:07,075
We're going to make him aware of just
how powerless he is, as he writhes in agony.

33
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:17,285
And today, after another three or four hours...

34
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,685
...we should be able to put on
a magnificent, hellish show for him.

35
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:23,995
I get it! So that's why! That sounds great!

36
00:04:24,035 --> 00:04:28,295
That's all assuming that he
gets here in the next three hours.

37
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:32,865
I'll leave Kakarrot to you,
but please let me take those other three!

38
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,665
Do as you like. However,

39
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:40,275
do it after we get the Namekian
to tell us about the Dragon Balls.

40
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:49,015
I sure hope that Kakarrot does come!

Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

42
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:05,235
Dammit, what are you doing, Goku?
Has he really come back to life?

43
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:15,705
Say, at this point, what if we ran away?

44
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:19,685
There's no way we can win.
This is no time to be stubborn!

45
00:05:19,725 --> 00:05:25,185
Fool! They plan on wiping
out all of humanity in any case.

46
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:29,055
Even if you run away
now, you'll end up the same.

47
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:33,695
D-Dammit! Please, Goku, get here!

48
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:38,605
Show us how much
stronger than them you've become!

49
00:05:40,745 --> 00:05:42,505
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

50
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:45,275
Not yet?

51
00:05:45,315 --> 00:05:47,975
Guys! Hang in there a little longer!

52
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:58,055
Piccolo, Goku is sure to be
here in the next three hours, right?

53
00:05:58,095 --> 00:06:00,255
Who knows?

54
00:06:00,295 --> 00:06:03,825
Think of some way to
inflict some damage on them,

55
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,665
however little, before Son Goku gets here.

56
00:06:06,705 --> 00:06:09,835
Regardless of how much power
Goku may have gained at Kaio's place,

57
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:15,265
his chances of fighting both of
them and winning are next to impossible.

58
00:06:15,305 --> 00:06:19,045
We've made some tremendous enemies here.

59
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:27,685
If only I... I had been more
reliable earlier, Tenshinhan<i>-san...</i>

60
00:06:27,725 --> 00:06:30,855
...might not have had to die...

61
00:06:30,895 --> 00:06:33,685
That's right!

62
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:36,825
Who knew you were such a coward?!

63
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,965
Piccolo, be reasonable.
Gohan is still only five years old.

64
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:45,835
Ordinarily, he'd be in kindergarten right now.

65
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,165
It's miraculous that he's even here, isn't it?

66
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:51,175
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

67
00:06:51,215 --> 00:06:55,175
Gohan, I thought I had
raised you up to be a man.

68
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,175
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

69
00:06:57,215 --> 00:07:01,285
P-Please re-train me for the next three hours!

70
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:03,855
Don't act like a spoiled child!

71
00:07:03,895 --> 00:07:07,685
I've got no time for cowards!
Get out of here, now!

72
00:07:07,725 --> 00:07:10,025
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

73
00:07:16,905 --> 00:07:18,735
P-Piccolo!

74
00:07:18,775 --> 00:07:23,875
<i>Gohan, I've taught you everything I know.</i>

75
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:31,875
Gohan, come back! You've got to show
Goku how big and strong you've grown!

76
00:07:33,725 --> 00:07:35,215
Gohan!

77
00:07:40,295 --> 00:07:41,855
Kid!

78
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,695
You trying to run away?!

79
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:47,865
Well, that would be the smart thing to do.

80
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:50,765
W-Who's running away?!

81
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:55,205
I just have to go pee!

82
00:07:55,245 --> 00:08:00,115
And if you guys are going
to go home, now is your chance.

83
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:05,585
What was that? I didn't hear you.

84
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:12,085
Your momma's belly-button sticks out!

85
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:17,695
That brat! H-How...

86
00:08:17,735 --> 00:08:22,825
How did you know my
mommy's belly-button sticks out?!

87
00:08:33,745 --> 00:08:37,615
The mysterious energy that had
enveloped the battleground has disappeared,

88
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:41,715
as though it were never there,
which has allowed us to get closer,

89
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:45,125
so we are going to try to get
in as close to the scene as we can.

90
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:51,595
What in the world could be
happening? I am unaware of the details,

91
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:55,165
but could it be that
they have called a time-out?

92
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:58,595
I-In any event, it's certain
that the intense fighting

93
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:02,265
that was going on earlier is not occurring now.

94
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:04,835
Could they be taking a break?

95
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,075
What could this be?

96
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:09,075
I don't care what it is.

97
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:14,285
If they can buy even one minute–
one second of time to let Goku come back,

98
00:09:14,325 --> 00:09:17,855
nothing could work to our advantage better.

99
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:23,695
I guess so. I wonder if
Son<i>-kun</i> will get back during this time.

100
00:09:23,735 --> 00:09:25,295
On the other hand,

101
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:29,195
if Piccolo gets killed,
Kami<i>-sama</i> dies too, right?

102
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,265
What happens to our world if that happens?!

103
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,665
Isn't it obvious?

104
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:40,275
Either way, if Son<i>-kun</i> and the
others don't defeat those Saiyans...

105
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:43,015
...all of us are going to be killed.

106
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:49,185
Goku! Get here quick and defeat them!

107
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:50,515
If I have to die anyway,

108
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:55,025
I wish I could have collected
more gals' panties before I went.

109
00:09:55,065 --> 00:09:57,195
Frankly, that's not possible.

110
00:09:57,235 --> 00:09:59,625
Then there's no way they can win?!

111
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,025
I'm saying that there aren't
any gals that are stupid enough

112
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:04,435
to let their panties be stolen by you.

113
00:10:05,235 --> 00:10:08,205
–Why, you jerk...
–Gohan!

114
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:11,635
Chichi, have you come around? Are you okay?

115
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:13,175
Pa!

116
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:16,005
W-Where's Gohan<i>-chan</i>?

117
00:10:16,045 --> 00:10:17,175
Relax.

118
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,345
He's still all right.

119
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:23,585
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

120
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,185
He's doin' fine.

121
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,025
We have to hurry and save him!

122
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:31,195
We can't! That's nowhere
that we can get close to!

123
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,465
All we can do is wait here.

124
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:36,905
Gohan<i>-chan...</i>

125
00:10:56,085 --> 00:10:58,915
I'm going to go have a little fun.

126
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:02,185
I can't just sit still here
for three hours, after all.

127
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:07,195
Suit yourself. But Nappa,
don't go overdoing it, now.

128
00:11:07,235 --> 00:11:08,595
Why not?

129
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:13,035
For the sake of the hellish show
we're going to have in three hours.

130
00:11:13,075 --> 00:11:15,605
That's Vegeta for you!

131
00:11:15,645 --> 00:11:19,105
It'll be fine, don't worry about it!

132
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:26,215
One of the Saiyans has
taken to the skies by himself!

133
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:29,015
Where exactly is he planning to go?

134
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,595
I-It appears that he is
coming toward our direction!

135
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:41,295
He is rapidly approaching us!

136
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:50,375
G-Get us out of here!

137
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,185
H-He's chasing after us!

138
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:05,485
H-Here he comes!

139
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:16,635
Run!

140
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:21,065
You guys are a blight! Away with you!

141
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:35,845
G-Gohan<i>-chan...</i>

142
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,415
Ch-Chichi!

143
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:45,315
So this planet has this
sort of military, does it?

144
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:48,125
This should be a good time killer.

145
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:28,665
I thought these guys would be a little
more effective, but they're all worthless.

146
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:34,105
Beat it!

147
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,065
You guys were a waste of my time.

148
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:05,635
By the way, hasn't Goku come by the way yet?

149
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:12,235
No matter how funny my
jokes are, this is no time for laughs.

150
00:15:12,275 --> 00:15:15,745
The fate of the Earth is at stake!

151
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:17,975
Hurry, Son Goku!

152
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:24,985
I see it!

153
00:15:27,395 --> 00:15:28,985
Just a little farther!

154
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,765
Goku's presence?!

155
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:39,835
Yeah! He is getting close!
He just might be in time!

156
00:15:56,285 --> 00:15:58,785
Another two hours, huh?

157
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:03,825
You know, this planet Earth here

158
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:07,595
is a more wondrous
world than any I've seen before.

159
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,965
We'll be able to sell this one for a lot!

160
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:27,215
So this is the level of people it has, huh?

161
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:42,195
One more hour.

162
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:47,035
Kakarrot hasn't just lost
his nerve and run away, right?

163
00:16:49,705 --> 00:16:52,275
<i>Go for broke....</i>

164
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,745
<i>Looks like that's all we can do.</i>

165
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:01,945
He's arrived! Son Goku has arrived!

166
00:17:01,985 --> 00:17:04,955
Oh, Kami<i>-sama</i>! Hurry!

167
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:07,185
The Serpentine Road has ended!

168
00:17:11,395 --> 00:17:14,525
That was fast! That was wonderfully fast!

169
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:22,365
<i>Now then, there are only ten minutes left.</i>

170
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,715
<i>Shall I finish up with a little more fun?</i>

171
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:50,925
Scream! Suffer! Writhe in agony!

172
00:17:56,305 --> 00:17:58,735
You'd only live until tonight anyhow.

173
00:17:58,775 --> 00:18:03,775
We're going to turn all of
you on Earth into space dust.

174
00:18:04,955 --> 00:18:09,085
And the most hellish show still awaits.

175
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:18,525
There are two powerful <i>ki,</i>
separated from each other.

176
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,365
What's going on?

177
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:27,395
<i>And so, with Goku still absent,</i>
<i>the three hours had passed.</i>

178
00:18:37,415 --> 00:18:39,315
Time.

179
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:40,685
Damn!

180
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,415
Looks like waiting for him didn't do any good.

181
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,095
He's still not here?

182
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:56,665
That coward Kakarrot did not come.

183
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:59,935
F-Father is not a coward!

184
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,935
Dammit! Why isn't he here?!

185
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,035
<i>Son Goku...</i>

186
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:10,945
Now then, to take my time in making you hurt...

187
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:14,345
It's too bad I couldn't
show this to Kakarrot, though.

188
00:19:14,385 --> 00:19:20,485
<i>It's almost time when I could die, too...</i>
<i>Dammit, I feel like a suicide trooper!</i>

189
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:32,965
There's only one possibility for us to beat him.

190
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:39,775
Of course, that's only if
everything goes well. Listen up.

191
00:19:39,815 --> 00:19:44,255
First, Kuririn, you go
all-out to draw his attention.

192
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:50,285
And then I will find an opening
to grab his tail, a Saiyan's weak point.

193
00:19:50,325 --> 00:19:53,115
R-Right...

194
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:55,355
Once his power fails him, and he can't move,

195
00:19:55,395 --> 00:20:00,695
Gohan, you'll call up all of
your power and rush him. Got that?

196
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:04,235
Yes. It'll be okay. I won't run away this time.

197
00:20:04,275 --> 00:20:10,075
Of course you won't. Remember that
the fate of the Earth rests in your hands!

198
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,405
<i>All right!</i>

199
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:22,745
<i>Awesome! That's Piccolo for you!</i>
<i>I'm starting to see a little light here.</i>

200
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:24,255
<i>We just might win!</i>

201
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:26,485
Gohan, believe in yourself!

202
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:30,695
When you set your mind to it,
your power is even greater than mine.

203
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:36,065
<i>All right!</i>

204
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:01,255
Goku!

205
00:21:01,295 --> 00:21:02,255
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

206
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,095
Hurry and grab hold!

207
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:05,695
You're on!

208
00:21:05,735 --> 00:21:12,065
T-That kid! He really did
come back from Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s place!

209
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,265
Okay, I'm off!

210
00:21:16,305 --> 00:21:18,305
My training went great!

211
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:21,675
–We're counting on you!
–Good luck, Son Goku!

212
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:25,875
Guys!

213
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,285
Gohan!

214
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:29,345
Please be alive!

215
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:37,255
Here he comes! Son Goku is quite tired.

216
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:40,095
Hey!

217
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:42,325
Karin<i>-sama</i>!

218
00:21:44,135 --> 00:21:47,665
Here are the last two senzu beans!

219
00:21:49,705 --> 00:21:51,675
Thank you!

220
00:21:51,715 --> 00:21:53,105
These will be a great help!

221
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,105
We're all counting on you!

222
00:21:55,145 --> 00:21:56,875
I'll eat one of them right now...

223
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:06,755
All right, I'm at full health!

224
00:22:06,795 --> 00:22:08,815
Kinto Un!

225
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:13,325
It's been a long time, huh?!

226
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,995
I could sure use your help!

227
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:21,935
There are some incredible <i>ki</i>
gathered all together! That way!

228
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:23,335
<i>Hurry, Goku!</i>

229
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,335
<i>We're counting on you, Goku!</i>

230
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,645
<i>As fast as you can!</i>

231
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:47,625
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

232
00:22:47,665 --> 00:22:53,495
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

233
00:22:53,535 --> 00:22:55,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

234
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:04,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

235
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,855
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

236
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:14,955
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

237
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:18,455
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

238
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:21,095
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

239
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:28,605
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

240
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:32,705
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

241
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

242
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:38,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

243
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:44,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

244
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:46,415
<i>So sorry.</i>

245
00:23:46,455 --> 00:23:51,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

246
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:59,535
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

247
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:13,215
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

248
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:16,485
<i>Way to go, Piccolo! Pull out that Saiyan's tail!</i>

249
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:18,385
<i>Hell of a miscalculation, huh?</i>

250
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:22,325
<i>Did you think we would leave</i>
<i>our weak spot untrained forever?</i>

251
00:24:22,365 --> 00:24:24,325
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

252
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:27,965
<i>"Leave it to Me!</i>
<i>Gohan's Great Burst of Anger."</i>

253
00:24:28,005 --> 00:24:29,825
<i>Piccolo-san, run!</i>

254
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:34,105
<i>I'll stop him one way or</i>
<i>another until Father gets here!</i>

255
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:37,205
"Next time"
"Leave it to Me!
Gohan's Great Burst of Anger"
