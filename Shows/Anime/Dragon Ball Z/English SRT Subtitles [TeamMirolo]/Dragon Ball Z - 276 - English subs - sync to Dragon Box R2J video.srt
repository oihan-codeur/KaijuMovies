<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:36,005
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,665 --> 00:00:41,635
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,385 --> 00:00:48,885
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:54,645
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,685 --> 00:00:57,235

11
00:01:05,575 --> 00:01:08,535
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:11,535

00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,555

17
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:28,555
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,185 --> 00:01:36,975
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,775

<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:24,615
Inside of Boo, there's yet another Boo, huh?

24
00:02:24,655 --> 00:02:29,575
Does this mean he was
absorbed too? By himself?

25
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:33,165
<i>Having intentionally infiltrated</i>
<i>the inside of Boo's body,</i>

26
00:02:33,205 --> 00:02:37,495
<i>Goku and Vegeta had at last</i>
<i>discovered Gohan and the others.</i>

27
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:17,745
Inside here, I am immortal!

28
00:03:25,045 --> 00:03:29,595
<i>Suddenly, Boo appeared within his own body!</i>

29
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,805
<i>Faced with his invulnerable attacks,</i>

30
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,515
<i>Goku and Vegeta found</i>
<i>themselves in a desperate pinch!</i>

31
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:55,615
Vegeta!!

32
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:07,415
<i>"Where Is the Exit!?</i>
<i>Escape from a Collapsing Boo."</i>

33
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:22,015
I'm going to absorb you!

34
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,605
Vegeta!

35
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,915
Do not interfere!

36
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:52,425
I'm going to absorb you first!

37
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:05,685
Dammit...!

38
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:11,565
Behind you!

39
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:23,455
Great, great, do that some more!

40
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:31,385
All I have to do is wait, after all.

41
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:37,215
Wait for you to use up your
power on worthless attacks like that.

42
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,515
Why, you...!

43
00:05:43,435 --> 00:05:44,725
What's the matter?

44
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:48,395
All that's left for you is to be
absorbed, once you stop moving!

45
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:06,375
I want to see inside! I want to see!
I want to see!! I want to see!!

46
00:06:06,415 --> 00:06:10,505
<i>What in the world is</i>
<i>going on inside Boo's body?</i>

47
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,595
It's useless for you to hide!

48
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:59,425
Indeed, you really are something else.

49
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:04,225
Typically, you should have already
used up your power a long time ago.

50
00:07:04,265 --> 00:07:08,725
I-I still have enough power left to kill you!

51
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:16,905
What are you aiming at?!

52
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:22,215
Apparently, that wasn't
enough power to kill me, huh?

53
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:48,205
You're the one who's going to die!

54
00:08:48,245 --> 00:08:52,535
I'm not so sure about that.

55
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,545
It's not the only thing that might happen.

56
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:03,255
What would happen if I rip this guy out?

57
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:07,845
I wonder if it might be
somewhat advantageous to us.

58
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:17,145
I can't wait to see!
Will you turn back into this fatso?

59
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:20,405
Will you instead turn
back into that skinny guy?

60
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:23,235
D-Don't! Stop!

61
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:28,405
Either way, it would seem unmistakable that
your power would drop from where it is now.

62
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:33,375
Stop! Don't touch that! Take your hands off!

63
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:36,415
It seemed odd that you
would protect this fatso,

64
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:40,165
so I thought there might be something to him,
and saw about forcing you into giving it up!

65
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:43,635
Take your hands off of him!

66
00:09:49,765 --> 00:09:54,895
This upsets you more than I thought!
You appear to be considerably bothered!

67
00:09:54,935 --> 00:10:02,155
P-Please! You must not rip that guy
out by force! I won't be me any more!

68
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:04,735
I won't be me any more?

69
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:10,155
That sounds interesting! Did you
think I would listen to what you say?!

70
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:56,455
Don't let your guard down, Vegeta.

71
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:59,705
He might appear again from somewhere else.

72
00:10:59,745 --> 00:11:03,545
Look at that, Kakarrot.
This time, it looks like it's different.

73
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:22,145
H-Hey... There's something
strange going on with Boo.

74
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:24,435
Yes. What could be the matter?

75
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:33,155
What are you doing, Kakarrot?!

76
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:36,745
Now, while we can, let's
take everyone and get outside!

77
00:11:36,785 --> 00:11:37,865
Y-Yeah.

78
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:31,215
W-Which way are we supposed to go?!

79
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:32,635
How do I know?

80
00:12:44,435 --> 00:12:48,235
Hey, for some reason, that area
there is starting to wriggle around!

81
00:12:48,275 --> 00:12:52,525
He must be transforming again!
Either into the fatso or the skinny guy!

82
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:28,105
F-For some reason, it's getting incredibly hot!

83
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:42,415
W-What's this?

84
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:51,125
The temperature of Boo's
cells is increasing sharply!

85
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:54,965
A-At this rate, both of us
will be boiled octopuses!

86
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:26,375
Kakarrot!

87
00:14:31,255 --> 00:14:32,795
Are you okay?!

88
00:14:32,835 --> 00:14:36,885
Damn it all! Ain't there an exit anywhere?

89
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:59,695
That was incredibly hot!
Not even magma is like that!

90
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:02,865
If we had been touched by that,
not even our bones would be left!

91
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,585
Vegeta, look!

92
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:24,385
It's a little bit bright over there.
Ain't that light from outside?

93
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:25,515
All right!

94
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:34,775
We did it! That is outside!

95
00:15:37,275 --> 00:15:38,405
Ah! It's closing!

96
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:41,405
Hurry!

97
00:15:41,445 --> 00:15:43,035
Stop kidding around!

98
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,575
Dammit! Open up again!

99
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:03,675
Come on! Hurry and open!

100
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:17,235
What, what? Is that stuff
from before coming again?

101
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,855
What was that, anyway?

102
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:25,405
I know, Vegeta!

103
00:16:25,445 --> 00:16:27,745
You see? The very first Boo, right?

104
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:31,875
When he got angry, that steam came "pweet"
whistling out of the top of his head, right?

105
00:16:38,255 --> 00:16:41,005
That's what that stuff from before was!

106
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:44,385
Which means...

107
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:47,515
In any case, move back until
you're right against the wall.

108
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:01,945
It's here!

109
00:17:07,285 --> 00:17:08,575
Still not yet?

110
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,125
It's opening!

111
00:17:35,265 --> 00:17:37,105
We made it!

112
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,165
They've come out!

113
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:59,585
The rescue was a success!
They've done it, Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

114
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,465
We did it! Everyone is back to normal!

115
00:18:17,015 --> 00:18:18,475
I-Incredible!

116
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,565
Goku-<i>san</i> and company have rescued everyone

117
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:23,605
that was absorbed by
Boo from inside his body!

118
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:32,825
Hide these guys for the time being!
Boo hasn't noticed yet!

119
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,205
Yeah.

120
00:18:47,255 --> 00:18:48,755
<i>It couldn't be...!</i>

121
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,825
Hey, Vegeta...!

122
00:19:11,865 --> 00:19:15,415
It couldn't be that his <i>ki</i> is growing, could it?

123
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,455
I-Impossible!

124
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:00,745
What's this?

125
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,125
What is it?

126
00:20:05,165 --> 00:20:08,085
I-It's...!

127
00:20:14,175 --> 00:20:19,725
H-Hey... he's turning into
something awfully tough, ain't he?

128
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:21,855
No... hold on!

129
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:35,945
Look! He's intent on transforming again!

130
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,005
I wish he'd cut that out already.

131
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:52,595
Th-This can't be...!

132
00:20:55,515 --> 00:20:58,475
H-He's turning back...!

133
00:20:58,515 --> 00:21:01,265
Turning back, you say?

134
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:29,255
H-Huh...?

135
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:33,715
Don't scare us like that!

136
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:36,755
I-It's true, all right...

137
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:41,515
What do you mean, he's turned back?!

138
00:21:41,555 --> 00:21:45,565
Come on! Explain this all to me, would you?!

139
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:50,525
<i>At last, Goku and Vegeta had</i>
<i>safely escaped from inside Boo's body,</i>

140
00:21:50,565 --> 00:21:53,735
<i>together with Gohan and the others.</i>

141
00:21:53,775 --> 00:21:59,745
<i>However, at the same time,</i>
<i>Majin Boo transformed once again.</i>

142
00:22:01,455 --> 00:22:05,415
Look! He's shrunk down quite a bit!

143
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:10,005
We did it, huh Vegeta? We may be
able to manage something like this!

144
00:22:16,845 --> 00:22:22,395
<i>And yet, there's something unusual</i>
<i>about the way Kaioshin is terrified!</i>

145
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:26,435
<i>Stay sharp, Goku, Vegeta!</i>

146
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:38,735
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

147

<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

148

<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

149
00:22:55,925 --> 00:23:01,975
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

150
00:23:02,015 --> 00:23:08,975
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

151
00:23:09,015 --> 00:23:14,355
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

152
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,235
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

153
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:27,285
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

154
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:28,835
<i>Even now?</i>

155
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:36,465
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

156
00:23:36,505 --> 00:23:41,885
<i>There's some mysterious</i>

157
00:23:41,925 --> 00:23:48,355
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>

158
00:23:48,395 --> 00:23:58,405
