What do you think you're doing?! Is this a joke?

22

You must not!

27
00:03:05,865 --> 00:03:08,195
We should get out of here right now!

28
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:11,295
Wait until Son Goku<i>-san</i>
is back on his feet! After that–

29
00:03:11,335 --> 00:03:13,175
That won't be necessary!

30
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:31,215
A scarf around the neck...
of a young man with long black hair.

31
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:32,825
That's No. 17.

32
00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:36,625
No. 18 is a cute female type.

33
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:40,865
Trunks, they're just as you
described, unmistakably so, right?

34
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:42,625
R-Right.

35
00:03:42,665 --> 00:03:47,235
Those two are No. 17 and No. 18?

36
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:50,635
You must not be deceived
by their outward appearance.

37
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:54,235
They really are quite terrifying.

38
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:59,885
Those are the friends of
Son Goku that I told you about.

39
00:03:59,925 --> 00:04:01,685
Do not take them lightly.

40
00:04:01,725 --> 00:04:05,685
They destroyed No. 19, and
came very close to killing me, too.

41
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:08,325
No. 19?

42
00:04:08,365 --> 00:04:10,325
You made one of those?

43
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:11,525
Yeah.

44
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:12,595
You don't say.

45
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:14,195
Then you had that one
reconstruct the professor himself...

46
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:16,595
...into this Artificial Human?

47
00:04:16,635 --> 00:04:19,605
Are you guys the energy-absorption type?

48
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:21,405
That's right.

49
00:04:21,445 --> 00:04:23,205
How come with the newer model,

50
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:26,605
you went back to the old
energy-absorption style?

51
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:29,445
I wonder if it's because the eternal-energy
models had too much power,

52
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:31,115
and were out of your control.

53
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:32,045
Yeah.

54
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,245
No wonder you got so beat up!

55
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,255
Out of his control?

56
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:44,555
None of that matters now.
Take care of them immediately!

57
00:04:44,595 --> 00:04:47,225
Quit your tiresome drivel!

58
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:49,595
We'll deal with them when we feel like it.

59
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:51,225
W-What did you say?!

60
00:04:56,615 --> 00:05:00,105
<i>Damn you...</i>

61
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:02,845
<i>If only I had my Controller...</i>

62
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:14,555
No. 16?

63
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:18,225
This one's another eternal-energy type, right?

64
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:22,225
But there must be something
different from our variety, isn't there?

65
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:26,635
It's a bit larger, for one.
I wonder what else is different.

66
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:31,235
Don't touch that, No. 18! Don't you touch!

67
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:33,045
Don't touch!

68
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,815
N-No. 16 now?!

69
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:40,615
I don't know that one! What does this mean?

70
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:44,055
Sounds interesting.
Should we start it up, No. 18?

71
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:48,825
No! Stop!

72
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:52,255
Do you want to destroy the world as we know it?!

73
00:05:52,295 --> 00:05:53,925
What?

74
00:05:53,965 --> 00:05:57,135
Destroy the world as we know it?

75
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:59,465
H-How can that be?

76
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:04,305
Hey, while these guys are
arguing, maybe we ought to run.

77
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:08,645
Be my guest. Except for myself,
I doubt anyone else can handle them.

78
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:14,215
No. 16 is a botched test unit
I worked my experiments out on.

79
00:06:14,255 --> 00:06:16,225
Do not start it up!

80
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:22,215
Stop! Don't touch it!

81
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:29,225
A lady does not wish to be
touched with such familiarity!

82
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:42,145
For being a botched unit,
you've sure let it sit here a long time.

83
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:45,315
Everything up until No. 15
seems to have been disposed of.

84
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:48,845
I was planning on rebuilding it before long.

85
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:50,585
At any rate, do not activate it!

86
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:54,925
If you do, it could cost all of us our heads!

87
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:59,295
It could cost all of us our heads?

88
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:09,235
Even though according to
this data, my power is higher?

89
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:12,775
T-That's right!

90
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,775
I don't care. Activate it, No. 18.

91
00:07:15,815 --> 00:07:20,345
How dare you defy me at
every turn! You're just like No. 16!

92
00:07:20,385 --> 00:07:23,355
You're a failed unit!
You just keep doing as you wish.

93
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,285
I'm going to shut you down!

94
00:07:25,325 --> 00:07:27,285
I broke your override Controller.

95
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,225
I'll just rebuild it!

96
00:07:34,465 --> 00:07:36,595
Haven't you understood a single word I've said?!

97
00:07:36,635 --> 00:07:38,225
Don't push that switch–

98
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:57,315
N-No. 17... W-Why you...

99
00:07:57,355 --> 00:08:02,665
What's this? I'm the one who made you!

100
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:16,205
You damned piece of junk!

101
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:30,815
How could he?

102
00:08:30,855 --> 00:08:34,055
That was his father, who created him!

103
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:48,065
M-Me?

104
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:54,675
Why just me?

105
00:08:54,715 --> 00:08:57,315
Stop being such a sore loser and go!

106
00:08:57,355 --> 00:08:58,875
Easy for you to say,

107
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:02,045
but for just me to have my luck run out...

108
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:07,055
Sooner or later, we'll all meet this fate.

109
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:21,235
They just kill anyone they don't care
for, no matter who they may be, huh?

110
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:23,205
Just like the Saiyans.

111
00:09:23,245 --> 00:09:24,835
Even their parents and children.

112
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:29,045
It's you Earthlings alone who are the
strange ones for thinking differently.

113
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,175
Well, press the switch.

114
00:09:31,215 --> 00:09:32,415
No you don't!

115
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:35,615
I won't let you add any more Artificial Humans!

116
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:42,955
You crazy idiot!

117
00:09:57,745 --> 00:10:01,275
If you're going to do that, say
something before hand, all right?

118
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:07,715
Stupid jackass! Your actions are worthless!

119
00:10:07,755 --> 00:10:09,715
What do you mean, worthless?

120
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:12,085
Take a look over there.

121
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:31,075
A blast at that level was nothing
but a useless waste of energy.

122
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:34,405
You better open it soon.

123
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:37,245
The pipes and cords are disconnected and all.

124
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:46,095
This is why kids are thought of as foolish.

125
00:11:00,705 --> 00:11:02,465
S-She opened it!

126
00:11:02,505 --> 00:11:05,475
Don't tell me there's going
to be one more of them?

127
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,015
So that's No. 16?

128
00:11:52,055 --> 00:11:55,555
Sure enough, he looks awfully strong!

129
00:11:56,325 --> 00:12:01,325
<i>He's unknown! I've never seen this one.</i>

130
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:08,365
Yo, No. 16. This is the first time
we've seen you up and around.

131
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:11,905
How do you feel being out after so many years?

132
00:12:14,415 --> 00:12:19,015
Doctor Gero was against re-activating you.

133
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:22,545
He said it might cost all
of us our heads if we did.

134
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:26,085
We'd like to know what he
meant by that. Any thoughts?

135
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:31,355
Do you just not want to say?

136
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:34,305
Perhaps you're just a man of few words.

137
00:12:36,605 --> 00:12:39,265
No matter. Shall we go?

138
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:40,565
Where to?

139
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:43,875
It's obvious, isn't it? Son Goku's place.

140
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:49,275
You were originally created
to kill Son Goku, weren't you?

141
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:50,275
That's right.

142
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:53,915
Dear me, he's finally opened his mouth for us.

143
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:57,285
Your responses are just as afforded
by the input Doctor Gero gave you.

144
00:12:57,325 --> 00:13:00,025
It was rude for him to consider you a failure.

145
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:02,955
Much as it irritates me
to do as Doctor Gero says,

146
00:13:02,995 --> 00:13:07,365
we Artificial Humans need some
kind of target to start out with.

147
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:08,895
All right, let's go.

148
00:13:23,515 --> 00:13:25,915
<i>N-No way!</i>

149
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:30,215
T-They're going! Thank goodness!

150
00:13:30,255 --> 00:13:34,285
What do they plan on doing?
Where are they headed?

151
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:37,755
Looks like they don't plan on
rampaging through Metro North.

152
00:13:37,795 --> 00:13:39,295
Their direction is different.

153
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:42,925
It's Goku! Aren't they
headed toward Goku's home?

154
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:43,895
You see?

155
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:49,105
Doctor Gero's goal was to kill Goku
for vanquishing the Red Ribbon Army!

156
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:53,775
Yeah, but I can't believe
they'd follow Doctor Gero's orders.

157
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:57,845
None of that matters!

158
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:00,315
I am right here!

159
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:03,855
They utterly ignored me.

160
00:14:03,895 --> 00:14:07,355
Are they trying to say I'm beneath their notice?

161
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:09,325
They dare to make light of me.

162
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:16,365
You can't pursue them!

163
00:14:16,405 --> 00:14:19,365
Just for a while... Please
wait for just a little while!

164
00:14:19,405 --> 00:14:22,365
You mean until Kakarrot
recovers from his illness?

165
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:25,175
Kakarrot? You mean Goku<i>-san</i>?

166
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:27,975
That's right. If we don't
include Goku<i>-san</i>'s power...

167
00:14:28,015 --> 00:14:31,715
...and all fight together,
we absolutely cannot win!

168
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:35,845
You're laboring under the wrong impression.

169
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:41,925
It's not the Artificial Humans
who I hate the most. It's Kakarrot!

170
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:48,295
I'll defeat them myself, and
I don't need Kakarrot's help to do it.

171
00:14:48,335 --> 00:14:51,865
Then when it's all over,
I will finally defeat Kakarrot.

172
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:53,295
Now that you know, move it!

173
00:14:53,335 --> 00:14:54,805
That's senseless!

174
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:57,905
Going after them yourself is like
going willingly to your own death!

175
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,915
Please, wait just a little while longer!

176
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:13,885
Hey!

177
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:16,995
Are you okay?

178
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:18,255
G-Go after him!

179
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:23,195
We can't let him go off on his
own until Goku<i>-san</i> has recovered!

180
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:25,195
Please stop him!

181
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:29,765
Gohan and Bulma<i>-san</i>
are headed to Goku's home.

182
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,605
They'll be overtaken soon!

183
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,245
This is bad.

184
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,275
My mother and the others are in danger!

185
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:40,315
Let's go after them!

186
00:15:55,935 --> 00:16:01,205
Unbelievable. Usin' my scarf
as some kinda makeshift diaper!

187
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:02,905
This ain't never comin' out.

188
00:16:07,415 --> 00:16:11,975
Yajirobe, do you have anything
else I can use to bundle him up?

189
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:14,385
You think I'd give you anythin' else?

190
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:17,285
But Trunks<i>-chan</i> might catch cold!

191
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:22,385
Just relax! We all know Trunks'll
grow up as big's he is with no trouble.

192
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,595
Oh, I guess you're right.

193
00:16:25,635 --> 00:16:30,535
Trunks<i>-chan</i>, it'll take more
than this to chill you, huh?

194
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,335
Great, great!

195
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:37,335
Ooh, great!

196
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,865
Ooh, great, great!

197
00:16:42,385 --> 00:16:44,315
Bulma<i>-san...</i>

198
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:48,985
If it's okay, I'd like to hurry up a bit.

199
00:16:49,025 --> 00:16:53,895
Okay. I'm sure you're worried
about Son<i>-kun</i>'s condition. Let's go.

200
00:16:55,395 --> 00:16:58,725
<i>I wonder if Father is doing better yet.</i>

201
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:13,475
Once Goku<i>-sa</i> is better,

202
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:19,145
he'll be sure to say "I'm hungry.
Chichi, ain't we got nothin' to eat?"

203
00:17:22,085 --> 00:17:23,515
So I'm rollin' up my sleeves an'...

204
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:26,355
...cookin' him more good
stuff than he could ever eat.

205
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:34,725
Goku, your medicine!

206
00:17:41,045 --> 00:17:42,335
Goku<i>-sa</i>?

207
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:46,745
Goku<i>-sa...</i>

208
00:17:48,615 --> 00:17:51,045
Goku is not going to die of any illness.

209
00:17:51,085 --> 00:17:53,015
He won't allow it to happen.

210
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:54,815
We need him to defend us,

211
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:56,915
and the rest of the Earth
from the Artificial Humans!

212
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:13,545
Looks like the medicine is
taking effect, and he's resting easier.

213
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:16,305
You really think so?

214
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:18,875
Yeah. You know what?

215
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,445
They said this illness was viral in nature,

216
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:25,075
so I'm going to take some of this, and
you should take a little too, Chichi<i>-san.</i>

217
00:18:25,115 --> 00:18:29,085
Leaving that matter aside,
what is Gohan<i>-chan</i> up to?

218
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:32,085
Oh? He hasn't come back yet, has he?

219
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,925
Maybe he's off playing somewhere.

220
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,965
<i>Curse you! What's so great about Kakarrot?</i>

221
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:50,375
<i>I've become a Super Saiyan too.</i>

222
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:53,575
<i>All other conditions being equal,</i>
<i>I, Vegeta-sama, the Saiyan prince,</i>

223
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:55,975
<i>am far above his level!</i>

224
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:59,745
<i>I'm going to show them my true power!</i>

225
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,815
No. 17, why are we landing?

226
00:19:31,855 --> 00:19:33,915
Let's take our time and
enjoy ourselves as we go.

227
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:36,345
There's no reason to hurry.

228
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:38,685
Are we walking then?

229
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:43,925
Let's go by car. Before long,
an automobile should pass by.

230
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:46,695
We'll go in that.

231
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:49,865
You boys sure do like this pointless stuff.

232
00:19:49,905 --> 00:19:53,165
Is that a leftover human trait of yours?

233
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:55,305
You understand, don't you, No. 16?

234
00:19:55,345 --> 00:19:59,705
You were constructed from
a human male, weren't you?

235
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:03,545
No. I was constructed from nothing.

236
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,645
You aren't human-based?

237
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:09,175
He's fundamentally different from us.

238
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,555
<i>That's strange.</i>

239
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:17,895
<i>If Doctor Gero had the technical skills</i>
<i>to build an Artificial Human from nothing,</i>

240
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:21,895
<i>why did he go back in the direction</i>
<i>of building them from a human base?</i>

241
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:25,895
Yo!

242
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:33,305
I didn't expect to find you
dallying around here like this.

243
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:36,305
What's this? There's a different kind
of air about you than you had earlier.

244
00:20:36,345 --> 00:20:39,315
It's not just the air, pal.

245
00:20:39,355 --> 00:20:43,715
I want you to tell me where
you think you guys are headed.

246
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:46,885
Son Goku's place. We're going to kill him.

247
00:20:46,925 --> 00:20:50,895
So we were right. You won't
be able to make it there.

248
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:54,735
That's because I'm going to put you all away.

249
00:20:57,305 --> 00:21:03,365
Is that funny? Laugh all
you want while you still can.

250
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:06,905
Saiyans are so overly sure of themselves.

251
00:21:06,945 --> 00:21:09,145
Son Goku seems to be the same way.

252
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,915
Because of that pride, the
more unprepared they are,

253
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:13,945
the sooner they die.

254
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:18,555
You spout that ridiculous
blather quite well for a puppet!

255
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:21,725
I'll smash you to bits!
Which one of you is first?

256
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:25,395
The kid? The woman? The big dunce?

257
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:29,565
Or perhaps you'd rather
I take all three of you on at once?!

258
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:31,765
You're overdoing it.

259
00:21:31,805 --> 00:21:33,565
What was that?!

260
00:21:33,605 --> 00:21:38,135
No. 16, I want to see
your power. You go ahead.

261
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,005
I decline.

262
00:21:40,745 --> 00:21:47,285
Looks like that one has at
least figured out my ability.

263
00:21:47,325 --> 00:21:50,655
He's a strange one. Says he declines.

264
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:57,055
You should have kept your place.

265
00:21:57,095 --> 00:22:00,265
Very well. I'll do it.

266
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:03,065
Let me warn you now,

267
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:06,395
I won't be pulling any punches
just because you're a woman.

268
00:22:06,435 --> 00:22:10,405
Then again, you're an Artificial
Human. You aren't a woman, are you?

269
00:22:10,445 --> 00:22:16,005
<i>The time is upon us when</i>
<i>the Artificial Human No. 18...</i>

270
00:22:16,045 --> 00:22:20,685
<i>...first reveals the power</i>
<i>Trunks was so fearful of.</i>

271
00:22:20,725 --> 00:22:28,895
<i>What kind of fight will unfold</i>
<i>between her and the Super Saiyan Vegeta?</i>

272
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:48,145
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

273
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:53,985
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

274
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:56,355
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

275
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:04,825
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

276
00:23:07,165 --> 00:23:11,365
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

277
00:23:11,405 --> 00:23:15,465
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

278
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:18,975
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

279
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,605
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

280
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:29,115
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

281
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:33,215
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

282
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:35,025
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

283
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:39,055
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

284
00:23:39,095 --> 00:23:44,735
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

285
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:46,895
<i>So sorry.</i>

286
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:52,035
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

287
00:23:54,785 --> 00:24:00,045
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

288
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:13,855
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

289
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:17,465
<i>The fight between Vegeta</i>
<i>and No. 18 is now starting.</i>

290
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:20,195
<i>Vegeta, no matter how strong</i>
<i>you are, you can't do it alone!</i>

291
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:23,605
<i>Look! The gap in their</i>
<i>power is growing, little by little.</i>

292
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:25,535
<i>Vegeta is going to get himself killed.</i>

293
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,605
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

294
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:31,545
<i>"Good Looks and Super Power!?</i>
<i>No Blind Spot on No. 18."</i>

295
00:24:31,585 --> 00:24:34,655
<i>Father, what are we supposed to do?</i>

296
00:24:34,695 --> 00:24:37,745
"Next time"
"Good Looks and Super Power!?
No Blind Spot on No. 18"
