<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,820
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,960
You guys are finished now!

17
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,090
I'm going to blow myself up momentarily.

18
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,340
I may die, but all the rest of you will die, too!

19
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,760
The whole Earth will be caught in the blast!

20
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,350
What?!

21
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,140
W-What? He's going to blow himself up?!

22
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,310
Goodbye, Gohan.

23
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,730
Father!

24
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,180
<i>Goku sacrificed his own</i>
<i>life in order to save the Earth.</i>

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,180
Father!!

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,690
W-What?!

27
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,280
<i>W-What's this...?</i>

28
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,170
Th-Th-That <i>ki</i>...!

29
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,340
I-It couldn't be...!

30
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,590
I-It can't be...!

31
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,410
<i>Cell was not dead!</i>

32

<i>"A Nightmare in Broad Daylight!!</i>
<i>The Terror Becomes Even More Perfect."</i>

33
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,510
O-Only Cell has returned!

34
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:54,600
What could have happened to the
young man who disappeared with him?

35
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,430
How terrible, how dreadful,

36
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:02,440
how far beyond the limits of our
imaginations these Cell Games are!

37
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm talking again...

38
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,500
How? How come?!

39
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,500
Cell's still alive?!

40
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,880
What do you mean, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?!
He blew himself up for sure earlier!

41
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,010
I don't know how it can be, but
nevertheless, I'm certain that he's alive.

42
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,480
H-He couldn't be!

43
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,690
Are you saying that I did that for nothing?

44
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,310
That's what I'm saying.

45
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:49,190
And yet, you still got my planet destroyed!

46
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,370
Damn...

47
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,670
Kami-<i>sama</i>, something wrong?

48
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,090
Cell–Cell came back to life!

49
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,250
W-What?

50
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,680
What's more, he's far
more powered-up than before.

51
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,630
B-But, with Son Gohan there...

52
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,640
This time, even Gohan-<i>san</i>
might not be able to do anything.

53
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,820
You appear surprised.

54
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,700
Very well, I'll explain it to you.

55
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,490
This turned out to be a
fortunate miscalculation, even for me.

56
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,250
Inside my head, there is a small lump.

57
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,050
That is what serves as my nucleus.

58
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,260
As long as that is not destroyed,

59
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,300
this body can continue to regenerate itself.

60
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,100
Sorry about this, Kaio-<i>sama</i>!
This was the only place!

61
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,480
How can you say that...?!

62
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:47,350
When I blew up, as luck would have it,
my nucleus survived, uninjured.

63
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,310
To be honest, I did not figure on regenerating.

64
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,270
I just got lucky!

65
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:00,340
What was even more joyful to
me was that my body regenerated

66
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,390
in its perfect form, even without No. 18.

67
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,850
And it wasn't my ordinary
perfect form, like Son Gohan,

68
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,690
it had become greatly powered-up!

69
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,360
This is probably because,

70
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,530
as I was rescued from the brink of death,

71
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,400
my Saiyan cells allowed
my power to greatly increase.

72
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,290
Moreover, I was able to study
Son Goku's Instantaneous Movement.

73
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,720
In short, I was able to return here,
even more perfect than before.

74
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,470
It seems that Son Goku,
rather than defeating me,

75
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,930
has instead given me several presents.

76
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,200
G-Gohan!

77
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,050
What's so funny?

78
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,300
I'm happy.

79
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,680
Happy?!

80
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,020
Yeah. I'm happy that
I can now avenge my father,

81
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,350
who died because of my conceit.

82
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,700
I wanted so much to kill you with my own hands.

83
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,360
That's what I was thinking.

84
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,960
We'll see about that.

85
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,670
I doubt it's going to go
too well for you this time.

86
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,270
Trunks!

87
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,090
T-Trunks...!

88
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,010
Bye-bye, everyone.

89
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,430
Father!

90
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,720
<i>K-Kakarrot...!</i>

91
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,900
It seems that Son Goku,
rather than defeating me,

92
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,450
has instead given me several presents.

93
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,710
Happy?!

94
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,080
I'm happy that I can avenge my father.

95
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,790
<i>G-Gohan...!</i>

96
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,100
I wanted so much to
kill you with my own hands.

97
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,600
<i>N-No...!</i>

98
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:48,530
<i>He–Cell is not going to be defeated by</i>
<i>that lower-class warrior Kakarrot, nor his son!</i>

99
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,070
<i>It's going...</i>

100
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,320
<i>It's going to be by me!</i>

101
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,000
Dammit!

102
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,430
W-What exactly could be happening here?!

103
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,030
V-Vegeta!

104
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,460
V-Vegeta...

105
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,520
Cell! I, the Prince of
Planet Vegeta, will defeat you!

106
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,080
Prince of Planet Vegeta, huh?

107
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,260
Cell has won.

108
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,010
What the hell happened just now?

109
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,600
Away with you, Vegeta!

110
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,530
Well, well... This is an unexpected harvest.

111
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,100
G-Gohan!

112
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:17,890
Gohan!

113
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,560
Vegeta, you stupid bastard!

114
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,270
Trunks could have been brought
back to life with the Dragon Balls!

115
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,240
Ho... Apparently, you haven't
lost any of your heart, at least, huh?

116
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,050
But I'm not playing around any longer.

117
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:46,460
I'm going to put an end to this right away.

118

We've used them all up...!

121
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,400
Th-This time, we're finished for sure!

122
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,610
Now that Gohan, who we were
depending on, has wound up like that...

123
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,060
I... will no longer tolerate you!

124
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,410
Let you and the whole Earth cease to exist!
