3
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:29,755
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:36,465
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,505 --> 00:00:43,075
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:51,945
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,485 --> 00:01:04,455
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:07,925
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

15
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:38,735
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:12,435 --> 00:02:17,365
<i>Thanks to the young boys who were</i>
<i>drifting along in their mirrored spaceship,</i>

17
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:24,245
<i>Bulma and the others learned of a new</i>
<i>evil that existed separate from the Saiyans.</i>

18
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:05,745
We made it! We've arrived at Planet Namek!

19
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,315
Is that really–?

20
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:11,795
Sure it is. Isn't it obvious?
Just like those kids said.

21
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:22,735
<i>"Kind-hearted Aliens.</i>
<i>There's the Wu Xing Qiu Ball Already."</i>

22
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:35,945
Both of you, fasten your seat belts.
There'll be quite a jolt when we touch down.

23
00:03:35,985 --> 00:03:37,175
Oh, right.

24
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,385
Commence landing in a suitable location.

25
00:03:56,675 --> 00:04:00,035
We did it! We've landed on Planet Namek!

26
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:00,835
Amazing!

27
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:05,635
What kind of place is it?
We can't see much through this mist.

28
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:07,045
Are you sure this is it?

29
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:08,205
No mistake about it.

30
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:09,205
But...

31
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:13,045
I rebuilt this spaceship!
Are you trying to put it down?!

32
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,645
No, it's not that...

33
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:16,255
Then what <i>is</i> it?

34
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,815
We should be able to tell right
away by looking at the Dragon Radar.

35
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,055
Y-Yeah, yeah, right!

36
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,085
Good grief, you're so skeptical...

37
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:57,125
K-Kami–?

38
00:04:57,165 --> 00:04:59,195
You're finally awake, are you?

39
00:04:59,235 --> 00:05:00,765
–Who are you?
–Lychee.

40
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:03,965
The biggest quack doctor on the planet.

41
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:09,575
And this loudmouth is Zarkuro. He's
been bad company for me for 300 years now.

42
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:11,575
T-Three hundred years?!

43
00:05:11,615 --> 00:05:13,415
Nice to meet you.

44
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,115
That's how we say hello on this world.

45
00:05:17,155 --> 00:05:20,545
Nice to meet you. I'm Bulma.

46
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:25,155
You know, you're lucky that
I was the one who discovered you.

47
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,325
If it weren't for me taking the proper measures,

48
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:30,295
all three of you would have croaked.

49
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:32,125
Thank you.

50
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,795
Come on, now, how long are you going
to sleep? Both of you, hurry and wake up.

51
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,195
Come on.

52
00:05:43,175 --> 00:05:47,015
Nice to meet you.

53
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,475
Um, this is Planet Namek, right?

54
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,485
Yes, it is.

55
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:57,485
We can tell just by looking at
your faces. You look just like Kami<i>-sama.</i>

56
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:01,285
That's right. You look
just like Piccolo<i>-san</i>, too.

57
00:06:01,325 --> 00:06:04,895
I sure hope you find
them okay–the Dragon Balls.

58
00:06:07,335 --> 00:06:08,705
H-How did you–?

59
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:37,165
We know everything there is to know about you.

60
00:06:38,535 --> 00:06:41,065
Well, you are Kami<i>-sama</i>'s relatives, after all.

61
00:06:41,105 --> 00:06:43,465
I guess there's no reason why you wouldn't.

62
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:48,335
You needn't worry. We won't stand in your way.

63
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:52,375
Oh, right, where's our spaceship?

64
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:56,905
Oh, we put it in the storeroom in back.

65
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,855
Here it is.

66
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,605
It's pretty damaged, but still okay, right?

67
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:22,665
Probably.

68
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:25,375
Thank you for everything.

69
00:07:25,415 --> 00:07:27,205
Don't mention it.

70
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:32,415
You really are kind-hearted
people for doing all this, aren't you?

71
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:46,825
–Look! They're here!
–All right!

72
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:49,895
There, look, look!

73
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:53,735
See? There are three of
them grouped together near here!

74
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,135
How lucky for us!

75
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,405
Let's hurry and go look for them.

76
00:07:57,445 --> 00:08:00,145
With any luck, we can get three of them today.

77
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:01,585
All right, let's go!

78
00:08:13,325 --> 00:08:14,955
Okay, let's go!

79
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:16,125
Right.

80
00:08:16,165 --> 00:08:18,295
That thing won't do you any good.

81
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:22,125
This area is a dangerous
one, and teeming with monsters.

82
00:08:22,165 --> 00:08:27,365
If you go out in that toy-like thing,
you'll get yourself stomped on easily.

83
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:30,005
Monsters?

84
00:08:36,785 --> 00:08:38,185
Bulma<i>-san...</i>

85
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:43,355
All right, what choice do
I have but to let you use my goku?

86
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,795
Goku?

87
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:09,315
What do you think? My dear
little Goku is pretty fast, huh?

88
00:09:10,485 --> 00:09:11,675
Yeah...

89
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:20,655
There it is! It's around here!
Could you land around here?

90
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:24,895
A-All right. Goku, here! Land!

91
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:28,895
Oh, no!

92
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,845
With a spaceship like this one...

93
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:58,355
Was it down there?

94
00:09:58,395 --> 00:09:59,755
No, it wasn't.

95
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:03,535
Search carefully. It has to be around here.

96
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:13,945
Sorry to have to make you do this, as well.

97
00:10:13,985 --> 00:10:17,745
That's okay, this is staving off boredom.

98
00:10:17,785 --> 00:10:18,845
It's a big help.

99
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:23,255
After all, right now, Earth could be
facing a great crisis at any moment, and...

100
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,415
Oh, you know all about it, huh?

101
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:26,895
Yes.

102
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:34,335
It's definitely down there
somewhere, no doubt about it.

103
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,825
Did you find it?

104
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,465
We couldn't hold our breaths any longer.

105
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,905
This is going to be really hard.

106
00:11:15,945 --> 00:11:19,775
Still, there's no mistake
that it's around here someplace.

107
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:22,305
Huh? Where's Lychee<i>-san</i>?

108
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:52,475
Here it is!

109
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:55,545
Lucky!

110
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:30,605
R-Really?

111
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:53,225
He's completely regained consciousness.

112
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:05,155
<i>K-Kakarrot...</i>

113
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:14,225
<i>Why? Why, when my battle</i>
<i>power is far and away higher than his,</i>

114
00:13:14,265 --> 00:13:18,255
<i>did I take that attack dead-on?</i>

115
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:26,265
What?!

116
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,075
What did you do that for out of nowhere?!

117
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,075
Ee-yow!

118
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:42,145
Patients should act like patients,
and lie there quietly, you know!

119
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:46,985
I'm just so bored, so bored!
I can't wait to go cut loose!

120
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:49,455
Patients shouldn't be talkin' nonsense.

121
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,465
Goku<i>-sa</i>, until your body is doin'
better, you're to behave yourself.

122
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:55,895
Is that for me?

123
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:59,165
This? If you can put it on, you can wear it.

124
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,435
I guess not, then.

125
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:13,415
These ancient ruins are from
four or five-thousand years ago.

126
00:14:13,455 --> 00:14:15,985
Wow, five-thousand years?

127
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:21,015
Look here, the Dragon Ball is
within a five-meter radius of us.

128
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:24,425
Bulma<i>-san</i>, over there.

129
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:25,865
Find it?

130
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:29,635
There are stairs over here.

131
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:33,965
The Radar's readings are getting stronger.

132
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,405
It must be in here.

133
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:40,375
All right, let's go.

134
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:42,045
Bulma<i>-san</i>, wait!

135
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:52,415
Wow, these are ancient Namekians.

136
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:59,895
Their faces are completely different
from the way they look now, aren't they?

137
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:02,925
Yeah, it would seem so...

138
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,305
W-What are these?

139
00:15:14,345 --> 00:15:17,115
I wonder if there's treasure in them.

140
00:15:19,355 --> 00:15:20,915
It's right close by.

141
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:24,885
In here.

142
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:25,915
T-That's–!

143
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,365
Ulp... Is that–?

144
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:49,145
Okay, let's find one
more before the day is over!

145
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:52,775
You're sure a chipper old man, huh?

146
00:15:52,815 --> 00:15:57,615
He's a nice fellow, isn't he?
Doing this for complete strangers like us.

147
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,785
That's what's so fishy
about it. We should be careful.

148
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:03,225
It's possible that once
we get all seven together,

149
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:04,795
he might be planning to swipe them from us.

150
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:06,665
He couldn't be.

151
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:22,645
It's in this area. Could you set us down soon?

152
00:16:22,685 --> 00:16:24,675
Yes, yes!

153
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:54,975
Huh?

154
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,575
What's the matter?

155
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:59,175
The Dragon Ball is moving.

156
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,965
A-Are you all right?

157
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:21,165
I'm fine, but the Radar–

158
00:17:27,185 --> 00:17:29,975
C-Could you hand that over?

159
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:40,555
Hey! Hold it!

160
00:17:40,595 --> 00:17:41,825
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

161
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,335
Hey! Hold it!

162
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,275
Telling him that isn't
going to get through to him!

163
00:17:58,915 --> 00:17:59,875
Wait!

164
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:01,205
What are you doing?!

165
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:04,845
Y-You can't go any farther!

166
00:18:04,885 --> 00:18:08,045
We have to hurry, or he'll get away, you know!

167
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:11,015
Why are you stopping me?! Let me go!

168
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:14,055
If you go any farther,
your life will be in danger.

169
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:21,495
He's gone.

170
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:27,335
Listen, you're not planning to
swipe the Dragon Balls from us, are you?!

171
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:30,705
I-I wouldn't do that.

172
00:18:30,745 --> 00:18:36,115
You're acting funny. You're being
far too nice to perfect strangers like us.

173
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:48,585
That's his voice.
Something has happened to him.

174
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,925
Let's go have a look.

175
00:19:12,455 --> 00:19:15,855
I'm sure it was around here...

176
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,955
Whoa! That's that thing from earlier!

177
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:26,955
The water in these swamps is dreadful
stuff that will dissolve any living thing,

178
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:31,795
and the gasses that rise from it will take
out any ordinary person who breathes them.

179
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:34,805
Is that so? So that's why you stopped us, huh?

180
00:19:34,845 --> 00:19:36,805
I'm sorry for saying something so terrible.

181
00:19:36,845 --> 00:19:39,605
Just so long as you know, it's all right.

182
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,405
Thank goodness.

183
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:43,505
Still, we're in a jam.

184
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:48,915
If he's ended up like that, that means
the Dragon Ball is in the swamp, right?

185
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:52,755
How are we going to get it out of there?

186
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:54,325
Oh, that would be impossible.

187
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:55,325
Under any circumstances?

188
00:19:55,365 --> 00:19:59,025
Well, I do have a bodysuit for
that sort of thing, but even if you

189
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,895
were to wear it to dive down there,
it would only be good for ten seconds.

190
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:05,635
Any longer than that,
and the suit will dissolve.

191
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,205
I'll do it.

192
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:14,105
After all, we can't do anything
unless we have that Dragon Ball, right?

193
00:20:14,145 --> 00:20:15,705
That may be so, but...

194
00:20:15,745 --> 00:20:17,615
I just need to come back
up within ten seconds, right?

195
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:21,185
I'll give it a try. Please let me do it.

196
00:20:21,225 --> 00:20:24,385
I know. What if we tied a
special rope around his body,

197
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:27,725
to pull him up before ten seconds is up?

198
00:20:27,765 --> 00:20:29,725
Mm-hmm, that sounds good.

199
00:20:29,765 --> 00:20:32,025
All right, let's give it a try.

200
00:20:45,145 --> 00:20:48,505
Judging from the readings on the
radar, it's right underneath us. Good luck.

201
00:20:48,545 --> 00:20:51,145
We'll pull you up with the
rope after seven seconds, okay?

202
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,375
Okay.

203
00:20:57,185 --> 00:21:04,255
2... 3... 4... 5... 6... 7...

204
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,125
Now!

205
00:21:11,905 --> 00:21:16,565
Oh, no! The swamp water
is stronger than I figured...

206
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:19,945
–Gohan<i>-chan</i>!
–Gohan!

207
00:21:22,785 --> 00:21:26,545
<i>All right, great. Now to hurry up on the rope.</i>

208
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,915
<i>The rope!</i>

209
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,945
<i>I have to act fast, or I won't make it!</i>

210
00:21:40,565 --> 00:21:43,765
<i>It's no good! I won't last</i>
<i>until I make it to the top like this!</i>

211
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,235
<i>It's no good!</i>

212
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:51,775
<i>Masenko!</i>

213
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,105
Gohan<i>-chan...</i>

214
00:22:03,685 --> 00:22:05,085
Gohan!

215
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,095
I'm back.

216
00:22:11,635 --> 00:22:14,465
–He made it!
–He made it!

217
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:16,925
He made it, all right...

218
00:22:16,965 --> 00:22:22,335
<i>Bulma and the others were ecstatic</i>
<i>over already obtaining three of the Balls.</i>

219
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:28,805
<i>Now then, will they be able to get</i>
<i>all of the Dragon Balls without any trouble?</i>

220
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:46,995
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

221
00:22:47,035 --> 00:22:52,865
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

222
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:55,235
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

223
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:03,745
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

224
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:10,215
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

225
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:14,285
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

226
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:17,825
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

227
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:20,495
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

228
00:23:22,205 --> 00:23:28,005
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

229
00:23:30,205 --> 00:23:32,075
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

230
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:33,905
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

231
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:37,975
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

232
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:43,645
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

233
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:45,815
<i>So sorry.</i>

234
00:23:45,855 --> 00:23:50,925
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

235
00:23:53,635 --> 00:23:58,905
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

236
00:24:10,585 --> 00:24:12,715
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

237
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,745
<i>I wonder if Gohan and the others</i>
<i>have found the Dragon Balls yet.</i>

238
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:18,385
<i>I can't just sit around, either.</i>
<i>I have to start training.</i>

239
00:24:18,425 --> 00:24:22,385
<i>Oh, no! Goku-sa has slipped out of the hospital!</i>

240
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:24,295
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

<i>"Planet Freeza No. 79</i>

242
