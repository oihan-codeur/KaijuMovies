<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:36,070
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,700
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,950
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:54,710
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

Gohan-<i>san</i>, I'm impressed. You really came, huh?

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,160
I mean, it's not as though... ummm...

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,160
Huh? A m-movie?

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,210
I'm so happy!

27
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,750
Okay, let's go, let's go!

28
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,790
U-Uh... er...

29
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,800
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

30
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,410
The Great Saiyaman appears!

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,580
All right...

32
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,320
<i>The Great Saiyaman, a justice-loving new hero...</i>

33
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,870
<i>His activities have become the</i>
<i>subject of rumors in Satan City.</i>

34
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,930
<i>And, taking an interest in the</i>
<i>true identity of Great Saiyaman,</i>

35
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:57,720
<i>was Son Gohan's classmate and</i>
<i>Mister Satan's daughter, Videl.</i>

36
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:09,190
<i>"Gohan, Scramble! Save Videl!!"</i>

37
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,330
I'm off!

38
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,210
Big Brother!

39
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,090
Big Brother, come back soon!

40
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,890
Goten, you've gotten
good at riding Kinto Un, huh?

41
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Big Brother, you're looking cool, too.

42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,600
Okay then, off I go!

43
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,060
Bye-bye.

44
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,330
This is a big help.

45
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:00,080
Thanks to this transformation device,
I don't have to worry about being late.

46
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,370
Isn't that...?

47
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,090
Great Saiyaman...?

48
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,180
It's Videl-<i>san</i>. I can't go to school like this.

49
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,720
I've got no other choice...

50
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,080
You think you're getting away?

51
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,250
What do you think you're doing, Videl-<i>san</i>?

52
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,620
Chasing after me like I'm some villain...!

53
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,610
Today's the day when I find out who you are!

54
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,640
Aw... I've gotten pretty far away
from school while she was chasing me.

55
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,850
If I don't hurry, I'm going to be late.

56
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,360
Morning.

57
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,660
Good morning, Videl-<i>san</i>!
Way to figure out where I am.

58
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,370
With that garish outfit of yours,
I could tell right away.

59
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,170
Say, just who exactly are you?

60
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:13,670
W-Well... like I said before...

61
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,760
I am he who does not abide evil,
the champion of justice,

62
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,680
Great Saiyaman!

63
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,640
Stop yanking me around.

64
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,060
N-No, I'm not yanking anything...

65
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,190
You may look nerdy, but you can fly,
and your strength is something else.

66
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,700
It's hard to believe that
you're just a regular person.

67
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,990
<i>If we're going to live</i>
<i>normally among regular people,</i>

68
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,540
<i>it won't help if they find out how strong we are.</i>

69
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,710
So it's a secret, no matter what?

70
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,880
Yes, no matter what.

71
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,090
Saying so makes me want to
know who you are that much more.

72
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,060
Hold on a second, you!

73
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,850
I'm sorry about this.

74
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,230
What are you doing?!
What do you mean by this?!

75
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,660
Forgive me, but I'll just leave this here.

76
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,910
Okay then, see you later–er, I mean, farewell!

77
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm going to find out who you are for sure!

78
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,100
Sensei, I'm sorry I'm late.

79
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,770
Oh, Videl-<i>kun</i>, that's okay.

80
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,440
Your position is a very busy one, after all.

81
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,400
Now then, hurry up and take your seat.

82
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,650
Right.

83
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,490
Was there some kind of
incident this early in the morning?

84
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,610
Mm-hmm, I guess you'd say.

85
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,500
Well, you can't help it, Videl,

86
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,670
but it's unusual for Gohan
to be tardy as well, huh?

87
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,670
Huh? Gohan-<i>kun</i>, too?

88
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,670
He just barely got here.

89
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,880
Ah, yeah, I just overslept a little bit.

90
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,800
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

91
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,010
<i>it seemed like the Great Saiyaman</i>
<i>was heading toward the school...</i>

92
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,810
<i>Uncanny...</i>

93
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,570
Today, thanks to the
actions of the Great Saiyaman,

94
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,490
precious lives were saved.

95
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,490
Indeed, Great Saiyaman is
the new hero of Satan City.

96
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:50,500
Hmph. How is he a champion of justice?

97
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,790
Compared to me, Satan-<i>sama,</i>
he's still on a small scale.

98
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know?

99
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,730
Come on, come on, what's the problem?!

100
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,040
Chief, the cops in Satan City are nothing special.

101
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,420
Yeah. If the boss was to come here,
there's nothing they could do about it.

102
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,210
How about we inform the boss right away?

103
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,720
Hey, misters, you can't go
around driving recklessly!

104
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,470
Who are you?

105
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,930
Chief, it's a high-schooler.

106
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,310
You're pretty sassy for a kid.

107
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,310
You mess with the Red Shark Gang, who
are bad enough to silence crying children,

108
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,060
and you're gonna pay for it!

109
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,030
<i>Gohan-kun!</i>

110
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,990
You shouldn't use force.

111
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,450
Shut up!

112
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,830
I guess I've got no choice now...

113
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,460
Videl-<i>san</i>...!

114
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,420
Now you've done it!

115
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,720
Chief!

116
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,510
Th-That's...!

117
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:35,720
Dammit! We won't forget this!

118
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,100
Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

119
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,980
Are you okay?

120
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,400
Stupid jerk!

121
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,400
Yeah, nothing wrong with me.

122
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,820
But it looked like you took
that incredible punch square-on...

123
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,950
Oh, that? Apparently, the guy
didn't have all that much power.

124
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,830
I'm sorry. I just looked on, thinking
that if you were the Great Saiyaman,

125
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,500
you should be able to take
care of them easily, Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

126
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,090
Huh? Me?

127
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,760
It was my misunderstanding.

128
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,100
If I had been a little later,
you could have been terribly hurt.

129
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,100
But I'm really glad that you weren't injured.

130
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,140
S-Sure!

131
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,850
<i>That was close, that was close!</i>

132
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,770
<i>I came this close to</i>
<i>revealing myself to Videl-san!</i>

133
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,070
Chief, that girl is Mister Satan's daughter.

134
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,120
The stories about her being
pretty strong are true, huh?

135
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,500
It's true, that girl's kick did hurt,

136
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,750
but as for my hand, which hit that kid–

137
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,830
cripes, it feels like I cracked my bones!

138
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,090
Damn, that bastard had one hard mug!

139
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:24,290
And so then, we went to the
same store we always go to,

140
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,790
and when we got there, those boys–

141
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,630
Yes, this is Videl.

142
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,220
Bad news! A band calling
themselves the Shark Gang

143
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,220
has taken the mayor of Satan City hostage!

144
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,360
You guys bring Mister Satan here, fast!

145
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,610
Otherwise, the mayor is dead!

146
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,330
W-What on earth do you
guys want with Mister Satan?

147
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,870
Our boss is here to challenge him to a duel.

148
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,000
What? A duel?

149
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,880
Mister Satan, I don't care if you
are a hero who saved the Earth,

150
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,510
you can't go swaggering around forever.

151
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,640
I, Rock-<i>sama</i>, am going to kill you!

152
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,890
And then, Boss,

153
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,690
this city will belong to us,
the Red Shark Gang, right?

154
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,070
I think I'll change its name to Rock City, too.

155
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,690
What do you think, Mayor?

156
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,450
Unless you want to watch your mayor get killed,

157
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,240
bring Satan here immediately!

158
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,920
Where is Mister Satan?

159
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,210
We've been trying to
contact him for some time now,

160
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,460
but he appears to be out,
and we can't reach him.

161
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:16,030
For crying out loud, you get famous,
and hotheaded guys like these show up.

162
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,280
I'd like to get out there
right now and knock them flat,

163
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,040
but they've got firearms.

164
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,620
It is my duty as a hero to
avoid this kind of danger.

165
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,370
I hate to say it, but all
I can do is wait this one out.

166
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:33,420
If you dawdle around, we'll kill you all, too!

167
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,130
Sensei, I'll be back in a jiffy.

168
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,470
Thank you for your efforts. Be careful, okay?

169
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,930
Sensei...

170
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,930
Yes?

171
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,430
E-Excuse me, but could I go to the restroom?

172
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,310
Again?

173
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,310
Son-<i>kun</i>, you've said that many times before,

174
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,310
and never come back, haven't you?

175
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,780
I don't care if your grades are
excellent, I will not allow it today.

176
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,410
Poor Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

177
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,300
He's here, is he?

178
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,310
You guys let the mayor go!

179
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:30,020
Boss, that's Mister Satan's daughter.

180
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,270
She looks pretty capable, huh?

181
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:37,320
But I have no business with his daughter.

182
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,530
I'm here to defeat Mister Satan.

183
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,660
Every once in a while,
there are guys like you that show up,

184
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,620
wanting to beat Papa and
make a name for themselves.

185
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,460
But Papa is busy, so in cases like this,
I'm the one who takes them on.

186
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,880
What?

187
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,300
It's true. Videl-<i>san</i> is so strong,
she rivals even Mister Satan.

188
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,800
Oh, so you're saying that if I defeat this girl,

189
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,310
it's as if I had defeated Mister Satan himself?

190
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,890
Very well! If you say so,
then that's another story.

191
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,860
Still, for being Mister Satan's daughter,
you're pretty cute, aren't you?

192
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,650
But I'm not going to hold back.

193
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,580
You appear to be a little stronger
than everyone else up to now.

194
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,870
I'm going to shred that cute little face of yours!

195
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,920
<i>Her opponent's ki is incredible.</i>
<i>Videl-san is in danger!</i>

196
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,300
<i>But how do I get out of this classroom?</i>

197
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,470
"...sister poet dear, brother poet, too...

198
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:49,350
"...wanna be with you,
'cause I need to spend my body.

199
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,730
"I'm a music makin' man, and
no peace can be released in life..."

200
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,730
<i>What to do? Isn't there</i>
<i>some clever way out of this?</i>

201
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,440
"...like this amplifier can.

202
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,530
"...your boy is doin' fine.

203
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,910
"And the energy you gave him
keeps me cryin' to the wind...

204
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,870
"...'cause I sing a natural
rhythm, play a magnetic chord...

205
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,830
"...the summer sun is high in the sky,
and love that's in everyone's eye..."

206
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,210
Ah! An earthquake!

207
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,470
Everyone, take shelter under your desks!

208
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:31,970
<i>Now!</i>

209
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,560
Transform!!

210
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,580
You're pretty good, aren't you?

211
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,510
Videl-<i>san</i>!

212
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,090
How cowardly of you!

213
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,600
Who are you?

214
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,900
My name is...

215
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,480
...he who does not abide evil...

216
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,570
...the champion of justice...

217
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,860
...they call me...

218
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,610
Great Saiyaman!

219
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,450
Videl-<i>san</i>, that's my line.

220
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,750
Hold on, you! This is my job,
so stay out of my way!

221
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,880
Nobody ever called you!

222
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,380
Y-You don't mean...?

223
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,470
W-What are they doing?

224
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,890
It's all right, just go someplace else!

225
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:56,810
Y-You sure are stern, Videl-<i>san.</i>

226
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,230
Shut up!

227
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,770
Hey, dispose of that weird bastard, too!

228
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Why, you...!

229
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,460
Are you okay, Mayor?

230
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,120
Th-Thanks.

231
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,790
Die!

232
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,690
You wench!

233
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,070
Videl-<i>san</i>!

234
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,960
<i>Maybe I was wrong to worry.</i>
<i>She's got extraordinary strength.</i>

235
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,600
All right, come on, get in!

236
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,810
Okay then, Videl-<i>san...</i>

237
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,890
Wait!

238
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,810
Thanks.

239
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:26,110
N-Not at all.

240
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,570
Now I want to know your
true identity even more.

241
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,570
I'm sure to discover it before long.

242
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,160
Well, good luck.

243
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,680
Huh? Gohan-<i>kun</i> did?

244
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,850
Right after you left, there
was that earthquake commotion,

245
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:58,220
and during that, he disappeared.

246
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,310
He came back just a little before you did, Videl.

247
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,900
I knew it! Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

248
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,900
Huh?

249
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,690
He was right behind us a second ago...

250
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,070
Good grief, he's a master of escape!

251
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,450
<i>Today, because of the Great Saiyaman's</i>

252
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,330
<i>However, Gohan is thinking that no</i>

260
