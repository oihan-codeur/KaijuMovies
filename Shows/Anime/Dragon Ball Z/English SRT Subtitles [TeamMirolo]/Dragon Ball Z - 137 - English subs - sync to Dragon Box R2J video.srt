<i>Goku was still down from his heart illness.</i>

20

We were created to kill Son Goku.

21
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:26,255
This is just a game.

22
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:30,755
Son Goku is the strongest
one in the world, right?

23
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:36,635
Humans... It's a game to kill him.

24
00:02:39,465 --> 00:02:42,565
See ya! Bye.

25

<i>"Piccolo's Resolution!!</i>
<i>The Last Measure in His Reserve."</i>

27
00:03:17,375 --> 00:03:20,365
That's right, I have to help everyone!

28
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:32,645
Let's see...

29
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:34,515
There are six senzu left.

30
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:38,555
I just split them up between
myself, Tenshinhan and Piccolo.

31
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:46,565
Hey, Tenshinhan, stay with us!

32
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:03,985
Here, have a senzu.

33
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:19,995
I guess I should feed one to Vegeta too.

34
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:29,675
What? You mean they
even knew the word "senzu"?!

35
00:04:29,715 --> 00:04:31,475
What does it mean?

36
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:35,645
If they knew so much, why didn't they kill us?

37
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:37,085
Good question.

38
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,385
Are they saying they don't need to kill us?

39
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:43,225
That we're no match for them?!

40
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,725
Of course they are.

41
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:52,165
Those guys are incredibly
strong. They're too strong!

42
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,865
How could anyone have
guessed they were as strong as that?

43
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,405
Vegeta!

44
00:05:09,415 --> 00:05:12,215
Trunks! Don't go after him! Stop!

45
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:15,585
Leave him alone.

46
00:05:19,395 --> 00:05:22,125
He had become a Super Saiyan,

47
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:24,625
and utterly regained all of
his pride and self-assuredness.

48
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:26,935
And yet, even though
they were Artificial Humans,

49
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,635
he was soundly beaten by a woman.

50
00:05:29,675 --> 00:05:32,975
His shock must be pretty great.

51
00:05:35,975 --> 00:05:37,945
As for the rest of us,

52
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:40,645
to think that we even teamed up
on them and couldn't beat them...

53
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:47,595
I'm sorry. My legs just cowered on me,
and I wasn't able to fight with you.

54
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:50,555
Don't worry about it.

55
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:54,295
Our opponents were such that
Trunks had even turned Super Saiyan...

56
00:05:54,335 --> 00:05:57,295
...yet he was still all but defeated in one blow.

57
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:00,605
If you had joined in, there's
not a thing you could have done.

58
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:05,735
Dammit, if only Goku were healthy!

59
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:10,375
This guy easily took care of even Freeza.

60
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:16,775
And yet, he was powerless to do
anything against the Artificial Humans.

61
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:23,585
Let's be frank. No matter
how strong Goku may be,

62
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,755
he can't be that much
different from Vegeta or Trunks.

63
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:29,995
There's absoultely no one who
can beat them, Goku included!

64
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:38,405
They were also somewhat different
from the Artificial Humans I knew.

65
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,375
How do you mean?

66
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:45,705
The ones I know didn't have
this kind of unbelievable strength.

67
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:49,555
I was able to at least hold
my own against their strength.

68
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:53,715
At any rate, the path
ahead is in complete darkness.

69
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:55,355
What should we do now?

70
00:06:55,395 --> 00:07:01,825
First, you guys go to Son Goku's house
and move him to a different location.

71
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:06,835
Whatever we do next, we can't
think of doing it until Goku recovers.

72
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,535
That's for sure.

73
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:12,565
So, Piccolo, what are you planning to do?

74
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,545
Good question.

75
00:07:16,585 --> 00:07:19,245
W-What's up with that expression on your face?

76
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:21,745
You must have some kind of strategy, right?

77
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,345
Come on, tell us! We're all friends here!

78
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:26,345
Friends, you say?

79
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,385
Don't get carried away with yourself!

80
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:34,955
When did I ever become friends with any of you?!

81
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:51,375
I am a demon clansman! Don't you ever forget...

82
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:55,575
I'm just using you to
help me take over the world!

83
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:09,795
That's right, I'd completely forgotten.

84
00:08:09,835 --> 00:08:11,795
He is, after all, the reincarnation...

85
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:16,805
of Piccolo Daimao, who Goku
and I fought against so long ago.

86
00:08:16,845 --> 00:08:22,735
Damn, don't tell me Piccolo is
still bent on world domination.

87
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:26,545
All his talk about scheming
to take over the world?

88
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:29,175
I don't think he means it.

89
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:33,755
He's just like Goku or Vegeta.

90
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:38,755
I bet all he thinks about is
being stronger than anyone else.

91
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:43,425
Therefore, he's flown off to take the
very last measure left in his reserve.

92
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:45,925
Probably so, anyway.

93
00:08:47,805 --> 00:08:51,505
What is this last measure you're talking about?

94
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:54,735
Piccolo flew off in that direction.

95
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,905
Do you know what's over there?

96
00:08:56,945 --> 00:08:59,605
That direction?

97
00:08:59,645 --> 00:09:05,415
Beats me. Nothing comes to mind.
Is it somewhere I know of?

98
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:06,815
Kami<i>-sama</i>'s place.

99
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:09,815
Kami<i>-sama</i>'s?!

100
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:11,755
I'm sure everyone already knew,

101
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:16,825
but Kami<i>-sama</i> and Piccolo
Daimao were once one Namekian.

102
00:09:16,865 --> 00:09:19,765
Once they divided, they
went their separate ways.

103
00:09:19,805 --> 00:09:23,365
And Piccolo's been reincarnated since then.

104
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,775
When I was on Namek, the
Grand Elder<i>-san</i> told me something.

105
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:30,545
He said if Kami<i>-sama</i> and Piccolo hadn't split up,

106
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:33,645
they could have stood up to even a Saiyan.

107
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:35,515
What I'm saying is,

108
00:09:35,555 --> 00:09:38,145
I think Piccolo has gone to Kami<i>-sama</i>'s
place in order to become his one,

109
00:09:38,185 --> 00:09:40,955
original self again.

110
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:42,515
What?

111
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,525
If Kami<i>-sama</i> and Mao join bodies,

112
00:09:44,565 --> 00:09:46,725
they'll return to a Namekian warrior.

113
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,965
However, since Piccolo is
so much more powerful now,

114
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,725
they'll become an exceptional warrior!

115
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:57,965
If Goku and company are Super Saiyans,
then Piccolo would be a Super Namekian!

116
00:09:58,005 --> 00:10:03,345
Super Namekian? That's incredible!

117
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:08,745
But if so, and Kami<i>-sama</i> disappears,
won't the Dragon Balls also vanish?

118
00:10:08,785 --> 00:10:11,215
Yeah, probably so.

119
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:14,985
But if Piccolo or Kami<i>-sama</i> were to get killed,

120
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:18,755
the Dragon Balls would vanish anyhow.

121
00:10:22,295 --> 00:10:26,665
If Piccolo really is planning
on reuniting with Kami<i>-sama...</i>

122
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:31,405
If he really feels that boxed in
by the three Artificial Humans,

123
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:34,135
it should tell us how fierce an enemy they are.

124
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:40,885
Piccolo hates Kami<i>-sama</i>'s guts.

125
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:46,755
What is my fath–I mean,
Vegeta<i>-san</i> planning to do?

126
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:50,285
Hey, there's no need to
hide it any more, Trunks.

127
00:10:50,325 --> 00:10:56,995
We all know you're the grown-up
version of the baby Bulma<i>-san</i> was holding.

128
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:01,735
The only one who doesn't
know is your father, Vegeta.

129
00:11:01,775 --> 00:11:04,735
Is that so? Please excuse me.

130
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:07,375
It's really nothing you need to apologize for.

131
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:11,745
Vegeta is definitely not the type to
run away just because he's lost a battle.

132
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:15,345
He's nearly the incarnation of pride itself.

133
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:18,385
I'm sure he'll come up with
some new finishing technique.

134
00:11:18,425 --> 00:11:21,655
He'll be back to face the Artificial Humans again.

135
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:22,985
Yeah.

136
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:38,935
Damn those Artificial Human
bastards! Toy with me, will they?!

137
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:44,315
They're going to regret turning me,
Vegeta<i>-sama</i>, back without finishing the job!

138
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:07,965
Forget about me. I don't
know when I'll be back again.

139
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:10,205
Farewell.

140
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:15,675
I'll be waiting for you.
Until you come back to me...

141
00:12:15,715 --> 00:12:20,115
No matter how long it takes, I'll wait for you!

142
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:29,655
Love is sure beautiful.

143
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:34,465
It's true. In the end, love will overcome.

144
00:12:35,465 --> 00:12:37,565
Maron<i>-chan</i>!

145
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:41,695
Huh? Has Kuririn come back?

146
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:46,565
Maron, I've been looking for you!

147
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:49,205
Well, if it isn't Mark!

148
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,575
Hey, Maron!

149
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:53,575
Ah, Tommy!

150
00:12:53,615 --> 00:12:55,575
Maron!

151
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:57,285
I love you!

152
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:02,615
I came flying back for you!

153
00:13:02,655 --> 00:13:07,625
Oh, you've all come for me? Maron's so touched!

154
00:13:07,665 --> 00:13:10,965
W-What's all this commotion?

155
00:13:11,005 --> 00:13:13,595
Just a minute, guys!

156
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:18,635
Oh, Maron<i>-chan</i>, what is all this?

157
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:22,635
Things got dull, so I called my boyfriends.

158
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:27,075
Y-You mean these guys are
all your boyfriends, Maron<i>-chan</i>?

159
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:28,115
That's right!

160
00:13:28,155 --> 00:13:33,525
Each of them has proposed to Maron,
but they're all so handsome, I can't decide!

161
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:37,655
Everyone else is waiting, so I'm leaving!

162
00:13:37,695 --> 00:13:42,295
Give Kurin<i>-chan</i> my regards! See ya!

163
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,565
She really left.

164
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:47,235
This may be for the best.

165
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:51,265
She's not a bad girl, but
she just doesn't suit Kuririn.

166
00:13:51,305 --> 00:13:52,465
Listen to me.

167
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:58,445
We're going to keep the fact that
Maron<i>-chan</i> came back for Kuririn a secret.

168
00:13:58,485 --> 00:14:00,075
Right.

169
00:14:00,115 --> 00:14:04,785
Still, even if it were just once...

170
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:10,385
I wanted to <i>pafu-pafu</i> with
Maron<i>-chan</i>'s chest! What a pity!

171
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:22,665
Say, Trunks, how long will it take Goku...

172
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:25,305
...to get better with that
medicine you gave him?

173
00:14:25,345 --> 00:14:29,635
Knowing Goku<i>-san</i>, I'd say
he'll be fine in ten days or so.

174
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:34,475
Ten days, huh? I think we can
manage to keep him hidden that long.

175
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:36,645
Yeah, one way or another.

176
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:39,045
Although, the idea of Goku getting better...

177
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:42,685
...and winning this fight seems
a little too good to be true now.

178
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:48,655
In any case, we're lucky those
three don't seem to have any kind of...

179
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:51,665
...radar device that can track our power.

180
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,105
Right.

181
00:15:08,355 --> 00:15:10,285
Goku<i>-sa</i>, are you okay?!

182
00:15:17,965 --> 00:15:20,125
Chichi, hurry, his medicine!

183
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:25,665
It's gone! The medicine's gone!

184
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:27,235
Gone, gone, gone...

185
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,665
Isn't that it over there?

186
00:15:29,705 --> 00:15:31,695
Oh, is this where it was?

187
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,715
Goku<i>-sa</i>, I got your medicine. Take this.

188
00:15:56,895 --> 00:16:00,465
Goku<i>-sa</i>, I'm beggin' you, get better quick!

189
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:16,975
Huh?

190
00:16:18,355 --> 00:16:23,555
Oh my! Bulma! Gohan<i>-chan</i>! Trunks<i>-chan</i>!

191
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:25,425
Mama!

192
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,555
We're back!

193
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,465
My, welcome, all of you!

194
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:34,135
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, look how big you're getting!

195
00:16:42,815 --> 00:16:46,105
You look so much more
brawny every time I see you!

196
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:47,845
Come, make a stay of it.

197
00:16:47,885 --> 00:16:50,685
I'll prepare some cakes and tea right away.

198
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,385
There's no need to be so modest!

199
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,155
Actually...

200
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:06,095
I have to hurry back to my father.

201
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:09,465
I'm stayin' for the chow
'fore I leave. It's good manners.

202
00:17:11,705 --> 00:17:12,905
Goodbye!

203
00:17:15,345 --> 00:17:18,445
Dear me, has he left already?

204
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:20,645
I'm sure he must be busy.

205
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:22,845
I wonder what the matter is?

206
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:26,085
What's the matter indeed?

207
00:17:31,165 --> 00:17:33,525
<i>There's nothing like playing the wetnurse.</i>

208
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:35,555
<i>Now, I'd better hurry!</i>

209
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:11,565
<i>So, Piccolo, you've finally made your decision?</i>

210
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:16,865
<i>Long ago, myself and Piccolo</i>
<i>Daimao were one and the same.</i>

211
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:20,275
<i>We were a single, gifted martial artist.</i>

212
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:26,945
<i>The time came when I learned of</i>
<i>Kami's existence, and I came here.</i>

213
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:39,685
<i>Unfortunately, even a Kami dies.</i>

214
00:18:39,725 --> 00:18:43,925
<i>I wanted to be Kami's newest successor.</i>

215
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:50,865
<i>However, no matter how much time passed,</i>
<i>Kami would not approve my request.</i>

216
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:55,075
"There is an evil that dwells in
the deepest reaches of your heart. "

217
00:18:55,115 --> 00:19:00,675
"As long as any amount of evil
dwells there, you cannot become Kami."

218
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:13,085
<i>This was because in the depths of my heart,</i>

219
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,655
<i>there lurked the slightest amount of evil.</i>

220
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,295
<i>Kami was able to see through to it.</i>

221
00:19:17,335 --> 00:19:22,635
<i>However, after rigorous training,</i>
<i>I was able to drive that evil out.</i>

222
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:26,265
<i>That became Piccolo Daimao.</i>

223
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,975
<i>I became Kami's successor...</i>

224
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:36,075
<i>...but Piccolo Daimao fled to the</i>
<i>ground, and seeking to rule the world,</i>

225
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:37,955
<i>became a cause of suffering to many.</i>

226
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:47,085
<i>But as he did, one young man</i>
<i>came and appeared before him.</i>

227
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,295
<i>It was Son Goku.</i>

228
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:29,925
<i>And so, what was reborn</i>
<i>is the Piccolo we know now.</i>

229
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:37,235
It appears that the time
for that which was divided...

230
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,265
...to be brought back together has come.

231
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:26,645
<i>Piccolo's final resolution:</i>
<i>Reuniting with Kami-sama.</i>

232
00:22:44,345 --> 00:22:48,335
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

233
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:54,175
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

234
00:22:54,215 --> 00:22:56,545
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

235
00:22:59,985 --> 00:23:05,015
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

236
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:11,565
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

237
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:15,665
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

238
00:23:15,705 --> 00:23:19,165
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

239
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:21,805
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

240
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:29,315
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

241
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:33,415
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

242
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,215
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

243
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:39,255
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

244
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:44,925
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

245
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,095
<i>So sorry.</i>

246
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:52,235
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

247
00:23:54,975 --> 00:24:00,245
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

248
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:13,825
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

249
00:24:13,865 --> 00:24:15,825
<i>You're going to observe</i>
<i>for a short while longer?</i>

250
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,295
<i>What are you talking about, Kami-sama?</i>

251
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,465
<i>The future is in tatters because of them.</i>

252
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:22,665
<i>Please understand, if this</i>
<i>is the last decision I make,</i>

253
00:24:22,705 --> 00:24:25,605
<i>then I would like a</i>
<i>conclusive reason to proceed.</i>

254
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:27,735
