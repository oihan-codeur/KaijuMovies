You can't mean it. I'll die.

Then get stronger!
Even stronger than me! And...

What are you doing over there?

42
00:06:15,645 --> 00:06:18,515
Wake up...

43
00:06:24,055 --> 00:06:27,815
Wake up... Kakarrot...

44
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:34,325
You little brat! What the
hell has gotten into you?!

45
00:06:51,345 --> 00:06:52,715
Damn!

46
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,755
Why, you–!

47
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:08,895
You dirty brat!

48
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,945
What's the matter?

49
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:34,715
Nowhere left to go!

50
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:58,775
H-His tail!

51
00:08:03,085 --> 00:08:05,045
That's it, all right...

52
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,015
It was half a year ago that I pulled it out.

53
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,485
And now it has grown back.

54
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:15,755
Which means... it can't be!

55
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:28,135
How can this be?

56
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:40,285
You little brat!

57
00:08:43,085 --> 00:08:44,995
Die!

58
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:41,445
Wha–?

59
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:43,045
What?!

60
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,075
A-At this rate, I'm done for!

61
00:10:25,955 --> 00:10:27,925
Begone!

62
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:44,635
What?!

63
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:48,915
What's up with that moon?

64
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:04,925
Cheers!

65
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:14,305
My, my, we've finally gotten them together.

66
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:19,605
Now we'll be able to bring Goku back to life.

67
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,605
We can take a breather now, too.

68
00:11:21,645 --> 00:11:26,615
Now all we have to do is
wait for those infernal Saiyans.

69
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:30,615
You say that, but originally, when
Goku was a baby, he was a Saiyan too,

70
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:35,425
who was sent here from Planet Vegeta
in one of those round vehicles, right?

71
00:11:35,465 --> 00:11:38,995
N-No he wasn't! That
might be the way he was born...

72
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:43,195
...but Son<i>-kun</i> is an exemplary Earthling.
Right, Turtle Hermit<i>-san</i>?

73
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:48,205
Er, of course he was.

74
00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:55,605
What's the matter?

75
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:57,275
The moon is out.

76
00:11:57,315 --> 00:11:59,275
Oh, you're right.

77
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:01,515
It's been a while, huh?

78
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:06,055
Something about that moon...

79
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,905
Don't get too carried away, you dirty brat!

80
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:46,525
T-That's Saiyan blood you've got, all right.

81
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:51,335
<i>The power I've got right now</i>
<i>won't do any good against the Saiyans.</i>

82
00:13:07,725 --> 00:13:09,215
Let go of me!

83
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:35,305
Damn...

84
00:13:54,465 --> 00:14:00,405
Dammit! At this rate, the Earth is
going to be destroyed by that brat!

85
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:37,675
W-What's that?

86
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:47,775
Wake up... Kakarrot...

87
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,685
So that's it.

88
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,025
The thing that's behind that moon...

89
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:57,895
...is the pod that Son
Goku came here in as a kid.

90
00:15:17,155 --> 00:15:19,385
It's all over now!

91
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,455
Sorry about that.

92
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:17,275
I'm going to make sure that I draw
out those dormant abilities of yours.

93
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:24,445
Geez, you sure are a lot of trouble.

94
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,695
A tail!

95
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:47,465
Hooray! I'm there!

96
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:06,495
Huh?

97
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:10,755
There ain't anything here.

98
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,365
You've got to be kidding me.

99
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,365
What's that?

100
00:17:28,945 --> 00:17:33,355
He's there! That's where Kaio<i>-sama</i> is!

101
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:54,235
This is it, all right. There's his house.

102
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,145
What?! What?!

103
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,815
What's wrong with the ground?

104
00:18:17,735 --> 00:18:20,255
Dammit!

105
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:30,275
Incredible... It's like I'm being
sucked in by some outrageous power!

106
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:38,205
I-It's no use! It feels like my
body is as heavy as lead! Dammit!

107
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:53,595
I've finally... reached... here...

108
00:18:53,635 --> 00:19:00,095
and I'm going... to meet
Kaio<i>-sama...</i> no matter what!

109
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:03,975
A little farther... A little farther...

110
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:15,485
But before that, let's
find me something to eat.

111
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:52,525
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>? Are you Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

112
00:19:57,335 --> 00:20:00,765
<i>Despite how he looks,</i>
<i>I'm sure he must be incredible.</i>

113
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:08,935
G-Good day. I'm Son Goku.
I ask that you train me.

114
00:20:14,045 --> 00:20:18,345
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, before we do,
can I ask you for an apple?

115
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,495
Wow, Kaio<i>-sama</i>, impressive!
You climbed up there easily!

116
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:52,315
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, sorry, but pick me
another one. I'll catch it this time.

117
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,155
All right, whenever you're ready!

118
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:12,765
I caught it! I caught it!

119
00:21:17,515 --> 00:21:22,075
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, teach me
martial arts, okay–I mean, please?

120
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:33,085
Is that training?

121
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:39,425
You're saying I should move like that, right?

122
00:21:49,645 --> 00:21:53,035
This is definitely hard...

123
00:21:53,075 --> 00:21:56,415
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what's the
matter with the ground here?

124
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:08,455
What are you doing?

125
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:22,105
<i>Is this curious man the real Kaio-sama?</i>

126
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:26,235
<i>When does Goku's training begin?</i>

127

<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>

<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

<i>I can't move the way I want to!</i>

145
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:20,725
<i>Surprised? My training is a bit "straining"!</i>

146
