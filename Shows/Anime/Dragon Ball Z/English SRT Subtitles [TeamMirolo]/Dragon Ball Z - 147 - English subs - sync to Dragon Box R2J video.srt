<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,910
<i>In order to combine with</i>
<i>Artificial Humans No. 17 and No. 18</i>

17
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,870
<i>and become his perfect form,</i>

18
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,940
<i>Cell continues to murder over and over again!</i>

19
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,710
<i>Cell masks his ki,</i>

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,250
<i>evading Piccolo and the others'</i>
<i>pursuit as if to make fun of them.</i>

21
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,000
<i>As this goes on, Goku finally recovers!</i>

22
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,210
Don't worry! I ain't fighting yet.

23
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,410
If Vegeta can't win against
them now, I can't win either.

24
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,650
That's why I'm thinking of
aiming for something higher, too.

25
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,690
Higher than Super Saiyan!

26
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:00,960
<i>"Hasten Your Training, Saiyans!</i>
<i>In the Room of Spirit and Time..."</i>

27
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,650
Yeah. I'm thinking of aiming for
something higher than Super Saiyan.

28
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,210
A-Aiming for something
higher than Super Saiyan, you say?

29
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,650
Is such a thing possible?

30
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,030
I don't know.

31
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,430
However, if I ain't as much as that,

32
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,200
I can't possibly win against this opponent.

33
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,970
I'll train for a year,

34
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,980
and if it's no use, I'll give it up.

35
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,640
One year? If it takes that long...

36
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,650
It's okay.

37
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,090
It'll be a year, but there's a
place where it will only take a day.

38
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,620
Chichi, I want to take
Gohan with me too, is that okay?

39
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,890
Y... Y...

40
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,870
Y-You've gotta be kiddin'...

41
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,210
...is what I was goin' to say,
but it's no use, so I'm stoppin'.

42
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,240
There's no helpin' it,

43
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,640
so if you're goin' to do it at all,
make him good and strong!

44
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,510
Chichi...

45
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,880
However, once this fightin'
with the Artificial Humans is over,

46
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,650
I won't let you get in the way of
Gohan<i>-chan</i>'s studyin', no matter what.

47
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,650
<i>She certainly is the wife of</i>
<i>the strongest man in the world,</i>

48
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,020
<i>and not just a "Spartan Mama!"</i>

49
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,190
<i>She sure has nerves of steel.</i>

50
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,600
On top of that, I'm goin' to
have you go to work, Goku<i>-sa.</i>

51
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,230
Thank you!

52
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,640
Mmm, how nice.

53
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,650
Well, I'm off.

54
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,070
He vanished! How'd he do that?

55
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,840
Goku<i>-sa...</i>

56
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,050
Haven't we reached the city where he is yet?!

57
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,620
Nope.

58
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,260
If we don't do this quick,
he'll run away on us again!

59
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,300
If we don't do this quick, he'll run away on us.

60
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,400
If only Goku were here.

61
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,400
Goku!

62
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,570
Yeah, if Goku were here...

63
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,340
Goku!

64
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,610
You see, with Goku's Instantaneous Movement...

65
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,180
Father!

66
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,550
Whoosh! We'd be... oh?

67
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,650
Yo!

68
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,990
Right, just like that, he
could appear anywhere... huh?

69
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,090
Go-Go... Go...

70
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,970
Yo, Kuririn!

71
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,070
Goku!!

72
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,230
Goku! I've missed you!

73
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,240
Man, have I been waiting
for this! When did you wake up?

74
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,190
You're all better then?

75
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,620
Yeah. My stomach's on empty, though.

76
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,020
Your stomach?

77
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,960
That's just like you, Goku!
You really are better, huh?

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,660
Yeah, I'm okay now.

79
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,090
Father!

80
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,200
Kamiccolo<i>-sama</i>!

81
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,230
What?

82
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,040
Don't merge the names together.

83
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,040
My base is mostly Piccolo,
so you can just call me Piccolo.

84
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,040
Oh, really? Well then, Piccolo...

85
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,070
What is it?

86
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,620
The way I am now,

87
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:52,390
there ain't no way I can win against
the Artificial Humans or this Cell guy.

88
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,960
So I'm taking Gohan with me,
and we're going to go train.

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,390
To the place where we can train
for a whole year in just one day.

90
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:03,070
What was that?

91
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,600
You want to go to the
Room of Spirit and Time, then?

92
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,040
I see now.

93
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,040
However, there hasn't been anyone that
was able to spend an entire year in there.

94
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,040
It was all you could do to
spend a month in there so long ago.

95
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,250
I'm taking Vegeta and Trunks with me too.

96
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,610
They're sure to be able to take it.

97
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,620
In that case, hurry and go, Goku.

98
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,220
Cell is rapidly killing people,
and rapidly becoming stronger.

99
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:30,260
If he combines with No. 17 and
becomes his perfect form on us,

100
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,270
there's going to be trouble.

101
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,110
Right!

102
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,950
Goku, let me ask you something.

103
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,310
Now that an enemy even more
incredible than Freeza has appeared,

104
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,820
are you scared?

105
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,950
Or instead, are you happy?

106
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,660
Both.

107
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,430
He's sure an imprudent one!

108
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,070
Here we are at a time when people are
being killed and the Earth is about to perish.

109
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,210
This is great! It looks as
though Goku hasn't given up yet!

110
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,280
A little bit of hope has come into view!

111
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,080
He really just might go beyond Super Saiyan!

112
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,710
Goku<i>-san</i>!

113
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,050
How are the results of your training?

114
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,620
It's no good.

115
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:41,220
Dad only sees me as a nuisance.

116
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,230
I ask him to train with me,

117
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,960
but he only persists in saying
I'm in his way and to get lost.

118
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,860
And far be it from training,

119
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:54,300
Dad has just stood there
motionless for the last three days.

120
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,240
As might be expected of Vegeta.

121
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,650
Apparently he's starting to faintly
see what lies ahead of Super Saiyan.

122
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,560
You're in the way, Kakarrot. Get lost.

123
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,800
Don't say that, I know a good place to train.

124
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,430
There's a room in the temple at Kami's home

125
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,880
where you can get a year's
worth of training in just one day.

126
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,580
Really?

127
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,180
Yeah. Come with me.

128
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,660
I ain't necessarily saying
you'd have to train with me.

129
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,530
However, the room has a capacity of two.

130
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,530
There ain't much time, so
I'll have you go in with Trunks.

131
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:00,040
Fine, provided that I go in first.

132
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,240
Yeah.

133
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,390
Provincial clothes...

134
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,300
Provincial house.

135
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,330
Son Goku lives in a place like this?

136
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:15,940
Indeed, Son Goku isn't here,
nor anyone else. They've fled.

137
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,350
So it seems.

138
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,920
Can you tell, No. 16, where he is now?

139
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,130
I can't sense Son Goku's power on my radar.

140
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,930
However, assuming he's gone
to one of his friends' places,

141
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,560
there's either the Capsule
Corporation in Metro West,

142
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,770
or Muten Roshi's small
island in the southern F region.

143
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,770
Makes sense. So, which one is closer?

144
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,140
Muten Roshi's house.

145
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:46,810
About 2700 kilometers southeast of here.

146
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,940
Okay, let's go.

147
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:51,780
My, my!

148
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,780
<i>Dammit, are we too late?</i>

149
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,380
And I thought for sure we were
going to take him down this time!

150
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,390
It's him!

151
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,330
Got it. Come.

152
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,950
There is tub, toilet and food.
Good luck with training.

153
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:09,950
Kakarrot, why are you
encouraging me to train, too?

154
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,760
My final objective is you, you know.

155
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,120
Our opponent this time probably

156
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,930
ain't the kind of opponent
one of us can beat alone.

157
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,930
You must have realized this too.

158
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,370
You may come to regret doing this.

159
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,920
Here. Who will use first?

160
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,920
Vegeta and Trunks will go in ahead of us.

161
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,550
Okay.

162
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,010
Enter.

163
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,340
Excuse us, Goku<i>-san.</i>

164
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,820
Hang in there, Trunks. Make nice with Vegeta!

165
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,820
Good luck!

166
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,540
It's hot! And the air is thin, too!

167
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,170
The gravity is many times greater as well!

168
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,950
What is this?!

169
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,930
There's nothing here! Nothing but white space!

170
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,910
It's impossibly vast!

171
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,110
This is what Goku<i>-san</i>
couldn't bear for a month's time

172
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,920
before he started not feeling right?

173
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,390
Yes indeed. This is fine.

174
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:38,160
<i>A year with Dad in a place like this?</i>

175
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,440
It didn't work, huh?
Damn him suppressing his <i>ki</i>!

176
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,980
This just isn't any good.

177
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,250
There's any number of
places he can hide, after all.

178
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,820
This is bad. By now, he
must be getting quite strong.

179
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,090
And we don't know when
he'll combine with No. 17

180
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,760
and the others to become his perfect form.

181
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,590
At this point, the only
thing we may be able to do

182
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,760
is hope Goku and the others
really do go beyond Super Saiyans,

183
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,400
and then together,
defeat No. 17 and the others.

184
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,980
<i>And so, after just about one</i>
<i>whole day had passed from the time</i>

185
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,310
<i>Vegeta and Trunks entered</i>
<i>the Room of Spirit and Time...</i>

186
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,320
This mysterious devil continues
to strike as ubiquitously as ever,

187
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,320
–and his victims are now said to
number several hundered thousand.
–Dammit, enough already, Cell!

188
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,560
–Meanwhile, the whole world continues
to live in terror of this devil.
–Why, you...!

189
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,930
Blasted Cell!

190
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,670
Yo. Is Son Goku here?

191
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,980
<i>D-Damn! Is this good timing, or poor?</i>

192
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,280
Son Goku does not seem to be here.

193
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,350
Is that so?

194
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,760
Wake up! We've got visitors of the worst kind.

195
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,360
What? What is it?

196
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,230
Go on back right now! Son Goku is not here!

197
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,670
So it seems.

198
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,240
Well then, why don't we
have you tell us where he is?

199
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,240
H-How did they know about this place?

200
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,250
Do you think we would just dutifully tell you?

201
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,920
Well, I'm not sure.

202
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,250
If you don't tell us, we
intend to force it out of you.

203
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:42,960
T-They're the Artificial Humans I've heard about?

204
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,530
I see. Well, you can try.

205
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:51,230
There's an island over there
with no one on it. Let's do it there.

206
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,240
Dear, dear, you never learn...

207
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,100
You guys stay here.

208
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,380
You have to know you would be of no use.

209
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,920
Say, do you think he can win?

210
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,690
It's impossible! He's got three opponents!

211
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,360
It's just about time for
two of the four among Goku

212
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,930
and the others to finish their training!

213
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,800
Until then, we'll have to rely on you, Piccolo!

214
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,930
Unless you say something,
I'll kill you for sure this time.

215
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,370
Understood?

216
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,170
It won't be as easy as it was last time.

217
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,320
<i>At last, No. 17 and Piccolo's fight begins!</i>

218
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,800
<i>Just how great is Piccolo's true power,</i>
<i>now that he's combined with Kami?</i>

219
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,580
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

220
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,420
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

221
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,790
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

222
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,300
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

223
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

224
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,910
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

225
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

226
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

227
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

228
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

229
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

230
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

231
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

232
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

233
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,480
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

234
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,480
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

235
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,400
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

236
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,570
<i>An awesome battle between</i>
<i>No. 17 and Piccolo has begun.</i>

237
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,870
<i>It's up to you, Piccolo.</i>

238
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,710
<i>You're the only one who's a match for him now.</i>

239
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,910
<i>If I can defeat No. 17, at least,</i>

240
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,750
<i>I can prevent Cell from</i>
<i>becoming his perfect form.</i>

241
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,980
<i>I accept this fight!</i>

242
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,920
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

243
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,730
"Next time"
"The Gekiretsu Kodan That Split the Heavens!!
Piccolo vs. Artificial Human No. 17"
<i>Hang in there, Piccolo-san!</i>
