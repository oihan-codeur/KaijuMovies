<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

00:00:26,055 --> 00:00:30,185
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,595 --> 00:00:35,935
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:41,565
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:48,825
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:54,585
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,165
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

00:00:57,205 --> 00:01:00,085

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:11,515
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

00:01:22,945 --> 00:01:25,525

<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

00:01:28,575 --> 00:01:30,865
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:34,075
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:36,915
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:36,955 --> 00:01:39,715
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:46,005
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:15,875
<i>Boo, having absorbed Piccolo's</i>
<i>brains and Super Gotenks' power,</i>

24
00:02:15,915 --> 00:02:21,045
<i>has transformed into the</i>
<i>mightiest Majin Boo of all!</i>

25
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:46,195
What do you think, Gohan-<i>kun</i>?
Look! Wonderful, isn't it?

26
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:47,865
As long as you were out absorbing people,

27
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:49,405
wanting to make yourself first-rate material,

28
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,825
it would have been a lot
easier to have just absorbed me!

29
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:57,535
You don't seem to understand at all, do you?

30
00:02:57,575 --> 00:03:00,745
Without an opponent, what am I
to do once I become the strongest?

31
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:02,205
What?

32
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:07,215
I am definitely going to blow
you away! That is my greatest goal!

33
00:03:07,255 --> 00:03:10,885
I see, so that's it. You've convinced me.

34
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:31,405
What's the matter?

35
00:03:31,445 --> 00:03:35,825
Are you trying to buy time by hiding
yourself there, while you hold your <i>ki</i>?

36
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,665
Which would mean that
you've realized at least this much–

37
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:48,175
that there's no way you
can stand up to me like this!

38
00:03:48,215 --> 00:03:49,675
We'll see!

39
00:03:55,675 --> 00:04:01,055
<i>"For the Sake Of the Entire Universe...</i>
<i>Return to Life, Son Goku."</i>

40
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:26,335
What's the matter?
Weren't you going to kill me?

41
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:33,055
You've got to watch your
opponent's movements more closely!

42
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:37,135
You were taught that in
training, right? By Piccolo?

43
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,055
S-Shut up!

44
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,235
Where are you looking?

45
00:05:10,215 --> 00:05:12,335
W-What does this mean?

46
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:17,345
After being powered-up that much,
Gohan-<i>san</i> is being so one-sidedly beaten!

47
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,965
Gohan...!

48
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:16,815
Gohan-<i>san</i>!

49
00:06:37,215 --> 00:06:39,635
That was Piccolo's technique, right?

50
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:46,345
<i>Makankosappo</i>, isn't it?

51
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:53,315
However, the force was much higher.

52
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:57,315
It was in a whole different league.

53
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,905
Don't you think?

54
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:28,015
I have obtained this, the
strongest power in the universe...

55
00:07:30,765 --> 00:07:33,355
...for the purpose of killing you!

56
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:20,525
W-What's that now? There's another
Boo that has come out of Boo's mouth!

57
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:22,195
How come? How come?

58
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,365
I am at a loss to say...

59
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,085
W-What is that?!

60
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:43,095
Die!!

61
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:48,805
Don't do it, Gohan! Don't touch that thing!

62
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,635
To say it in the same style as Super Gotenks,

63
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:30,385
<i>Super Boo Kamikaze Attack</i>, I suppose.

64
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:36,775
I wanted to try a bit more of this,
but it doesn't appear to be necessary.

65
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:38,475
Truly a shame.

66
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:48,365
Oh... To think that you could have
taken that head-on and still be alive!

67
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:50,825
You're really something.

68
00:09:52,155 --> 00:09:56,535
K-Kami-<i>sama</i>! Let me
have life, even after I've died!

69
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:04,135
I'm not dead! We survived, Wan-<i>chan</i>!

70
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:06,545
Wan-<i>chan</i> is gone!

71
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:15,475
I am the mightiest in the universe!

72
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:20,525
I am, absolutely! I will not
allow anyone to surpass me!

73
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,485
Wan-<i>chan</i>?!

74
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:29,865
O-Over there!

75
00:10:41,545 --> 00:10:48,505
D-Dammit, this is hopeless!
Gohan is going to get killed like this!

76
00:10:48,545 --> 00:10:51,515
I had not taken this into account...

77
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:55,555
Okay then, Son Goku, you go and help him!

78
00:10:56,435 --> 00:10:59,015
N-No, I can no longer...

79
00:10:59,055 --> 00:11:00,895
He's right, honorable ancestor.

80
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:05,065
Son Goku can in fact never
go to the temporal world again.

81
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:08,695
I know that.

82
00:11:08,735 --> 00:11:14,865
I will give you my life to replace
yours. Then, you can return to life.

83
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:18,455
G-Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, your life... to me?

84
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:20,085
Y-You mustn't!

85
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:25,215
That the Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> should
grant his life to a human, of all things!

86
00:11:25,255 --> 00:11:26,885
How can that be?!

87
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:29,885
In that case, the whole universe is finished.

88
00:11:29,925 --> 00:11:34,305
Majin Boo will surely come here as well.

89
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:37,265
Th-Then, at least, let it be my life!

90
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:39,265
K-Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

91
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:41,975
I was unable to prevent Majin Boo's revival,

92
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:44,605
nor could I contribute to Gohan-<i>san</i>'s training!

93
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:47,945
I want to be able to be at least that much help.

94
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:55,075
You need not go that far. You're still young.

95
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:59,955
I would only live another
thousand years or so anyhow.

96
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:02,415
Honorable ancestor...

97
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,415
O-Old-timer...

98
00:12:09,005 --> 00:12:11,675
W-What did you say?!

99
00:12:13,005 --> 00:12:15,425
Is this true?!

100
00:12:15,465 --> 00:12:21,515
Mm. It's a good thing I thought ahead,
just in case, and left his spirit the way it was.

101
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,515
I've even given him a body.

102
00:12:25,975 --> 00:12:28,525
Please, let this be of some help.

103
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:31,115
I don't think this is the
proper thing to do either,

104
00:12:31,155 --> 00:12:35,365
but it cannot be helped
if we are to save the Earth.

105
00:12:35,405 --> 00:12:39,365
Hmph. For you to have to
rely on a miscreant such as I...

106
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:41,495
However, with Majin Boo as my opponent,

107
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:46,545
I don't think I can fulfil
your faint expectations.

108
00:12:46,585 --> 00:12:54,305
Okay, Uranai Baba, I hate to have to
do this, but take him to Earth. Hurry.

109
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:55,465
Understood.

110
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,475
M-Me take him?!

111
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:01,395
The Earth–no, the universe is in crisis!

112
00:13:01,435 --> 00:13:03,475
Why does a weak old woman such as myself

113
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:08,525
have to go to where
that terrifying Majin Boo is?!

114
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:10,525
I'm counting on you.

115
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:14,525
On me, now? How pitiful.

116
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:07,995
Farewell, then.

117
00:15:52,515 --> 00:15:55,525
That was this Gotenks' technique as well.

118
00:15:55,565 --> 00:15:59,905
How does it feel, to be done
in by your own pals' techniques?

119
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:05,035
G-Gohan-<i>san</i>!

120
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:15,205
This is one of your techniques as well...

121
00:16:22,425 --> 00:16:25,465
You must be happy to be killed like this.

122
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,305
This was all too easy!

123
00:16:52,915 --> 00:16:54,915
You're a tough one.

124
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,555
Oof...

125
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:12,095
H-Honorable ancestor...

126
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:19,685
So then, farewell.

127
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:26,155
O-Old timer...

128
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:04,695
Thanks so much. I definitely ain't
going to let your life go to waste!

129
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,945
All right! Hurry up and go!

130
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:12,405
What are you doing?! Come on, come on!
Are you trying to make my death in vain?!

131
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,945
I told you, it is no use muffling your <i>ki.</i>

132
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:04,005
You just don't know when to give up.

133
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:06,925
Are you wanting to live
even one second longer?

134
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:15,475
What's wrong? Hang in there!
You're getting awfully weak.

135
00:19:58,515 --> 00:20:04,065
Not yet, not yet! As long as I have time
remaining, I will have you entertain me!

136
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:20,915
H-Hey, he's getting beaten!
He's getting beaten up!

137
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:26,925
Y-You should take the dog and run
far away! You'll be caught up in this!

138
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:31,425
Hey, if it comes to that–and
as a martial arts champion,

139
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:36,265
I hate to have to use it–this
.45 will start spitting fire!

140
00:20:36,305 --> 00:20:38,635
How about that?!

141
00:20:44,355 --> 00:20:46,485
Well, I'm off!

142
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:49,815
Just a second, Son Goku!

143
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:55,365
Going off is fine and all, but once you go,
how do you intend to beat Majin Boo?

144
00:20:55,405 --> 00:21:02,875
I hate to say it, but I don't think that
the two of you could beat Majin Boo now.

145
00:21:02,915 --> 00:21:05,455
Um...

146
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:12,465
Ah, yeah! Fusion! Me and Gohan
will do Fusion! Then we'll win for sure!

147
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:17,885
Fusion... Mm, that thing
those little guys were doing?

148
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,805
I doubt that Majin Boo would just wait around

149
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:25,315
while you guys go through the nuisance
of posing through that Fusion business.

150
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:27,685
Th-Then what should we do?!

151
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:32,195
Grand Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, it was you
who told me to go give it to him!

152
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:36,865
Which is why... Here!

153
00:21:36,905 --> 00:21:41,865
Put one of these Potara
earrings on your left ear.

154
00:21:41,905 --> 00:21:45,495
J-Just what sort of
purpose will that thing serve?

155
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:47,455
Good question...

156
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:56,505
By putting this on, will it make me stronger?
I ain't getting that sense at all.

157
00:21:56,545 --> 00:22:00,555
Have Gohan place the
other one on his right ear.

158
00:22:00,595 --> 00:22:06,055
Just by doing that, you two can
combine together, like you were in Fusion.

159
00:22:07,605 --> 00:22:09,145
Really?!

160
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:14,525
<i>Goku, having been returned to life</i>
<i>in order to save the entire universe,</i>

161
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:19,535
<i>takes possession of the Kaioshin's</i>
<i>precious merging items, his Potara.</i>

162
00:22:19,575 --> 00:22:25,535
<i>Will they really be the trump</i>
<i>card needed to beat Majin Boo?</i>

163
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:38,675
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

164
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:45,265
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

165
00:22:49,475 --> 00:22:55,815
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

166
00:22:55,855 --> 00:23:01,905
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

167
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:08,915
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

168
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:14,295
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

169
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:18,175
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

170
00:23:18,215 --> 00:23:27,265
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

171
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:28,765
<i>Even now?</i>

172
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:36,445
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

173
00:23:36,485 --> 00:23:41,825
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

174
00:23:41,865 --> 00:23:48,285
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

175
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:58,335
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

176
00:24:13,475 --> 00:24:15,235
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

177
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:18,065
<i>Gohan, put this Potara</i>
<i>earring on your right ear.</i>

178
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:20,735
<i>You'll unite with me, and</i>
<i>we can defeat Majin Boo!</i>

179
00:24:20,775 --> 00:24:23,075
<i>Fool! Do you think I'm going to sit back</i>

180
00:24:23,115 --> 00:24:25,115
<i>and let you just do as you please?</i>

181
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:27,325
<i>I'll eliminate you before you can!</i>

182
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,495
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

183
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:33,915
<i>"The Miracle Happens Once... Will the</i>
<i>Super Combination With Gohan Come About?"</i>

184
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:36,795
<i>Once we combine, we'll be</i>
<i>like this for the rest of our lives?</i>

185
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:39,465
"Next time"
"The Miracle Happens Once... Will the
Super Combination With Gohan Come About?"
