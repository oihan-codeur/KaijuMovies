<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:24,785
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,745
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:08,225
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,735
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:26,685
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:30,255
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:37,125
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:04,415
<i>Piccolo is resurrected!</i>

17
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:11,625
<i>In order to battle Freeza, Piccolo has at</i>
<i>last descended upon his home world of Namek.</i>

18
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:18,135
Now, speak forth thy third wish!

19
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:39,125
Make me immortally young!
Do you want to be killed by Freeza?

20
00:03:01,985 --> 00:03:04,775
<i>However, the Grand Elder's</i>
<i>life had reached its end,</i>

21
00:03:04,815 --> 00:03:09,455
<i>and with the third wish unfulfilled,</i>
<i>"Super Shen Long" disappeared.</i>

22
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:12,985
<i>Moreover, in the worst</i>
<i>of all possible situations...</i>

23
00:03:13,925 --> 00:03:17,195
You have really done it now, gentlemen.

24
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:21,895
You have done an outstanding job of
shattering my dreams of eternal youth.

25
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:33,245
<i>"Birth of the Mightiest Warrior?</i>
<i>Nail and Piccolo Merge."</i>

26
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:27,625
There are no readings
for the Ginyu Special Corps.

27
00:04:44,955 --> 00:04:47,945
Are you the ones who killed them?

28
00:05:03,705 --> 00:05:04,665
It is unfortunate,

29
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:09,435
that the Dragon Balls have turned to
stone just before I could have used them...

30
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:15,645
Unfortunate for Vegeta<i>-san</i>, to be
sure, but perhaps more so for myself.

31
00:05:16,955 --> 00:05:22,615
This is the first time anyone has been stupid
enough to make this big a fool out of me.

32
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:31,185
I did not expect things
to come to such a result.

33
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,065
You're going to pay!

34
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,935
You're going to pay for this, you puny worms!!!

35
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:48,275
I'm going to kill you all an inch at a time!!

36
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,975
There's no escape for you! Say your prayers!

37
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:57,355
So you finally show your true nature.

38
00:05:57,395 --> 00:05:58,955
Do your worst!

39
00:05:58,995 --> 00:06:03,825
If you think I'm going to be that
easy to defeat, you're greatly mistaken!

40
00:06:04,695 --> 00:06:06,895
Of all the things you might have said...

41
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:11,595
Apparently, you have
forgotten how terrifying I really am.

42
00:06:14,205 --> 00:06:16,545
Let me refresh your memory!

43
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,615
<i>Impossible!</i>

44
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,615
I didn't think he'd be this awful!

45
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:44,965
<i>That enormous ki is getting a lot larger.</i>

46
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,935
<i>This Freeza is about to make</i>
<i>his move against the others.</i>

47
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:59,055
<i>I feel a faint ki. No, it couldn't be Gohan!</i>

48
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:18,965
A Namekian, the spitting image of myself.

49
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:22,075
You're near death.

50
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:28,935
You must be the... Namekian
the Earthlings spoke of.

51
00:07:30,185 --> 00:07:36,045
So, their wish has been granted. Good.

52
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:39,725
You seem to have all the facts.

53
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:45,595
Then you must also know that I'm
rushing to help those brats out right now.

54
00:07:47,265 --> 00:07:50,635
You'll excuse me for leaving you here to die.

55
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,435
Surprising...

56
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,905
I don't know what discipline you've used,

57
00:07:56,945 --> 00:08:01,575
but you've managed to gain incredible power.

58
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,145
And yet, it's such a pity...

59
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:09,175
If you had returned as a
single, complete Namekian,

60
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:14,055
you might have been able to beat Freeza.

61
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,525
You're saying that if I had reunited with Kami

62
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,695
and become a single individual again,

63
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:23,725
only then would I be able
to overcome Freeza's power?

64
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:29,205
That's right. I may have been
utterly overwhelmed by Freeza,

65
00:08:29,245 --> 00:08:33,735
but I know his powers quite well.

66
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:43,215
No use arguing over it now.

67
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:48,595
For that matter, I have no intention
of ever reuniting with that guy.

68
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:52,565
Unite with me.

69
00:08:55,165 --> 00:09:01,705
I am the... last Warrior-Type
Namekian left on my world.

70
00:09:01,745 --> 00:09:03,375
What? With you?

71
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:05,705
That's right.

72
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:09,405
Your current power will be
increased several times over.

73
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:14,215
Thanks for the offer,
but I'd rather be who I am.

74
00:09:14,255 --> 00:09:17,415
I don't want to combine
my individuality with yours.

75
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:20,925
Such a proud fellow...

76
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:27,125
Hurry... There's... no time.

77
00:10:27,165 --> 00:10:29,825
I am about to die.

78
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:32,695
Quickly, place your hand on my body.

79
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:36,765
Do not worry.

80
00:10:36,805 --> 00:10:42,065
Your individuality will
be yours. I will be yours.

81
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:46,105
I offer no more than this opportunity.

82
00:10:47,685 --> 00:10:49,945
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

83
00:10:52,455 --> 00:10:54,245
If that's what you think,

84
00:10:54,285 --> 00:10:57,285
you can go on ahead and get killed by Freeza.

85
00:11:10,675 --> 00:11:12,635
<i>All right.</i>

86
00:11:12,675 --> 00:11:15,735
Fine, then. I'll try you out.

87
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:22,645
But if I don't like what
happens, I'll drive you out again.

88
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:24,545
What a thing to say,

89
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:30,155
while I'm offering such a wonderful
present to you of my own good will.

90
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:31,715
I'm in a hurry.

91
00:11:31,755 --> 00:11:34,355
If we're going to do this, let's get it over.

92
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:40,125
Be sure... you kill... Freeza.

93
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:42,395
I don't need you to tell me.

94
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:46,535
If I can, I'll do it for my own sake.

95
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:29,935
Impossible... How can this be?

96
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:34,405
What incredible power!

97
00:13:34,445 --> 00:13:37,615
What an unbelievably fearsome power this is!

98
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:41,145
Is this what uniting with someone is like?!

99
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,185
I will win!

100
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:50,295
Regardless of the opponent, I cannot lose now!

101
00:13:50,335 --> 00:13:53,895
I have now obtained the ultimate power!

102
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:22,385
Gohan! At this rate,
Vegeta will be beaten in no time.

103
00:15:22,425 --> 00:15:25,385
We have to act now. It's our only chance!

104
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,585
Right!

105
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:48,915
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

106
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:24,445
Su-Such a <i>ki</i>! There's no way we can win!

107
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,585
Of course not.

108
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:36,285
Did you think that only three
ants could defeat a whole dinosaur?

109
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:45,735
We <i>can</i> win!

110
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:51,905
If the three of us fight together,
we'll find a way to beat you.

111
00:16:54,045 --> 00:16:57,315
What's that? You can beat me?

112
00:16:57,355 --> 00:16:59,255
That's right.

113
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:05,385
That's the last thing I expected you to say.

114
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:08,225
Apparently, not even the great
Freeza realizes that these two guy's

115
00:17:08,265 --> 00:17:12,255
battle powers have been rapidly increasing.

116
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,225
Especially the shorter one,

117
00:17:15,265 --> 00:17:20,105
he's sitting on a power reserve
that not even he is fully aware of.

118
00:17:21,405 --> 00:17:22,535
And as for me,

119
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:27,075
I'm in the process of becoming
the Super Saiyan you've always feared.

120
00:17:30,915 --> 00:17:36,085
You brag quite well, what
with that talk of Super Saiyans.

121
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:43,265
You irritating rat!

122
00:17:47,865 --> 00:17:49,095
What?!

123
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:42,755
What's this?

124
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:08,275
So, apparently you aren't just talk, are you?

125
00:19:09,445 --> 00:19:11,415
<i>He's right...</i>

126
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:13,915
<i>If the three of us fight together,</i>

127
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:16,915
<i>there's a definite chance</i>
<i>of us making it through.</i>

128
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:22,795
<i>He's certainly very powerful,</i>
<i>but our power has risen too.</i>

129
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:28,025
<i>That's right, ever since Vegeta has come here,</i>

130
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:31,865
<i>he's managed to keep overcoming</i>
<i>his limits and grow stronger.</i>

131
00:19:31,905 --> 00:19:37,905
<i>So, why is Freeza still so calm?</i>

132
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,155
Transform yourself, Freeza!

133
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:49,815
–Transform?
–Transform?

134
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,515
He can transform?

135
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:53,655
Let's get right to it.

136
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:56,325
Why don't you transform
and show us your true self?

137
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:59,225
So, you knew about that, did you?

138
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,325
How did you come to find out?

139
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:04,795
That punk Zarbon let it slip.

140
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,305
What are you talking about?

141
00:20:07,345 --> 00:20:08,865
Among the universe's races,

142
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:11,875
there is a very small
number that have the odd ability

143
00:20:11,915 --> 00:20:13,805
of changing their forms when needed–

144
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,375
whether for camouflage,

145
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:20,255
or to conserve energy
consumption when it's unnecessary.

146
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:24,385
In my case, the reason is different.

147
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:28,915
I have so much power, it's
difficult for me to control it otherwise.

148
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:31,325
What was that?

149
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:32,725
Don't let him scare you.

150
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:37,335
He's bluffing, he won't change all that much.

151
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,435
Is that so?

152
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:48,705
Fine, then. If you want to
die that badly, I'll show you.

153
00:20:48,745 --> 00:20:50,545
Watch very carefully.

154
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:54,245
This is not something you'll see every day.

155
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,285
When I attacked the planet
Vegeta, home to the Saiyans,

156
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:05,265
you realize there was utterly
no reason for me to transform.

157
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:09,395
Vegeta<i>-san</i>, your father,
the king of Planet Vegeta,

158
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,795
was none too spectacular a warrior, you know.

159
00:21:12,835 --> 00:21:15,305
Don't flatter yourself too much about that.

160
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:19,805
I had overcome the king's
power way back when I was still little.

161
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:23,615
<i>Then the Saiyan's planet was destroyed by him?</i>

162
00:21:24,355 --> 00:21:28,945
Now then, marvel at this!

163
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:02,415
<i>At last, Freeza begins to change.</i>

164
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:07,795
<i>However, how much terror will this account for?</i>

165
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:22,975
<i>And will Piccolo and Goku</i>
<i>arrive in time for this terrific battle?</i>

166
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:48,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

167
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

168
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

169
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

170
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

171
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,985
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

172
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:19,495
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

173
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

174
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

175
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

176
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

177
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

178
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

179
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

180
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,565
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:14,145
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

183
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:18,885
<i>What's this? The strength of</i>
<i>Freeza's ki increased many times over.</i>

184
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:22,385
<i>I'd guess that you never imagined</i>
<i>I could become this powerful.</i>

185
00:24:22,425 --> 00:24:25,795
<i>Now then, which one of</i>
<i>you should I show to Hell first?</i>

186
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:27,665
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

187
00:24:27,705 --> 00:24:31,495
<i>"A Nightmare Super-Transformation!!</i>
<i>Freeza's Battle Power of One Million."</i>

188
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:38,275
<i>Vegeta-san, what happened to those</i>
<i>high spirits you were in a moment ago?</i>

189
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:38,275
"Next time"
"A Nightmare Super-Transformation!!
Freeza's Battle Power of One Million"
