<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:55,095
<i>Change!!</i>

17
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:27,885
H-How come... I'm... over... there?

18
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:32,895
I've made an exchange, your body for mine.

19
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:35,125
You did what?

20
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:41,595
<i>W-What's this? Goku and</i>
<i>Ginyu have switched bodies</i>!

21
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:50,415
<i>And now, Vegeta...</i>

22
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:53,415
<i>...Gohan, Kuririn...</i>

23
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:56,155
<i>...Ginyu, Jheese...</i>

24
00:02:56,195 --> 00:03:04,825
<i>and Goku are all racing toward</i>
<i>Freeza's spaceship, to get the Dragon Balls!</i>

25
00:03:06,705 --> 00:03:13,695
<i>"Come Forth, Super Shen Long!!</i>
<i>Grant Me My Wish."</i>

26
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:41,865
Looks like Freeza is out and about, all right.

27
00:03:41,905 --> 00:03:44,865
And so then, right there, I told him...

28
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,845
Wait, hold on now...

29
00:03:53,845 --> 00:03:55,675
What's this?

30
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:17,735
–What was that?!
–What's going on?!

31
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:20,745
W-What was that explosion just now?!

32
00:04:27,715 --> 00:04:30,675
V-V-V–

33
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:33,415
Vegeta!

34
00:05:53,635 --> 00:05:56,395
Damn!

35
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:59,135
Hey!

36
00:05:59,175 --> 00:06:01,975
Where are the Dragon Balls?

37
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:13,845
Look at all of you, lined up so loyally!

38
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:20,155
If you don't want to tell me...

39
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:26,395
...then you don't have to tell me.

40
00:06:44,855 --> 00:06:47,645
Lousy small fry.

41
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:51,355
You can swear your allegiance
to Freeza from the Other Side now.

42
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:56,555
Damn it all, Freeza...

43
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:59,155
Seeing as how Ginyu stayed behind,

44
00:06:59,195 --> 00:07:03,565
the Dragon Balls must
be around here somewhere.

45
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:06,505
In any event, those Earth punks can locate them

46
00:07:06,545 --> 00:07:09,005
with that strange device of theirs.

47
00:07:09,045 --> 00:07:12,575
They should be here very shortly now.

48
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:16,945
Until then, I'll see about
changing into some new battle wear.

49
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,725
So, this is what it's like to have
a body with a power of 180,000?

50
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:41,035
However, I think my previous face
was more handsome. Right, Jheese?

51
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:42,945
Absolutely!

52
00:07:46,945 --> 00:07:53,825
I-I've got to go faster, or
Kuririn and Gohan will get killed!

53
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:59,355
That way? No, this way!

54
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:09,965
Ribbit... ribbit... ribbit...

55
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:14,995
Damn it, I can't keep my
balance very well in this body.

56
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:26,655
<i>You know, there's something very unusual</i>
<i>about the medicine Kakarrot was using.</i>

57
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,415
<i>Not only does it heal injuries,</i>

58
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:33,985
<i>but it completely</i>
<i>restores one's strength as well.</i>

59
00:08:38,635 --> 00:08:42,035
<i>The only ones in my size</i>
<i>are the older models, huh?</i>

60
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:50,315
We're almost there, Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

61
00:08:54,345 --> 00:08:55,945
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, there it is!

62
00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:59,915
G-Got it! So that's their spaceship, huh?

63
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:07,525
So, you've arrived, Earthlings.

64
00:09:07,565 --> 00:09:10,995
It's no good if they realize I'm here.

65
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:15,905
I have to suppress my
battle power, the way they do.

66
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:23,975
Let's hurry and find them!
No one else seems to be here.

67
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:27,005
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, wait!

68
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:29,745
According to the readings on the Radar,

69
00:09:29,785 --> 00:09:33,045
the Dragon Balls aren't
inside the ship, but away from it.

70
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:40,985
Where are they, Gohan?

71
00:09:41,025 --> 00:09:43,085
Let's see... this way.

72
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:47,095
Right over here.

73
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:56,205
Here they are, Kuririn<i>-san</i>, here!

74
00:09:56,945 --> 00:09:59,035
Yeah, looks like something
was buried here, all right.

75
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:01,505
Why would they put them here?

76
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:03,515
Okay, let's dig them out!

77
00:10:03,555 --> 00:10:04,955
Right!

78
00:10:17,965 --> 00:10:20,555
Here's one! I found one!

79
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:22,925
There's another one over here!

80
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,935
Hooray! Here's another!

81
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:27,935
Looks like all seven are here after all!

82
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:32,075
<i>So that's where they hid them, huh?</i>

83
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,245
We've got them all! We've got them all!

84
00:10:39,585 --> 00:10:43,955
<i>Good. Now just summon that Shen Long thing.</i>

85
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,585
<i>I'll put you two away,</i>

86
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:52,035
<i>and then have my wish of</i>
<i>eternal life and youth given to me!</i>

87
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,625
We did it!

88
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:02,495
Hey, Gohan, what's that on your face?

89
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:12,975
Well, what about you, Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

90
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:20,655
<i>Hurry up and summon it, would you?!</i>

91
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:39,945
We sure worked hard for this, huh?

92
00:11:39,985 --> 00:11:46,755
Yes. Now Piccolo<i>-san</i> and everyone
else can finally be brought back to life.

93
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:52,955
<i>Do it already! Summon it!</i>

94
00:11:52,995 --> 00:11:58,525
Okay, here goes. We've come
such a long way for this moment.

95
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:02,525
Let's have ourselves a look at
what the original Shen Long looks like!

96
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:04,335
Right.

97
00:12:25,025 --> 00:12:32,935
Come forth, Shen Long, and grant me my wish!

98
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:52,215
Come forth, Shen Long, and grant me my wish!

99
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:58,155
<i>The incantation is as simple as that?</i>

100
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:18,275
<i>W-What's wrong? Isn't</i>
<i>something supposed to happen?</i>

101
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:21,145
<i>What is this Shen Long?</i>

102
00:13:37,295 --> 00:13:42,995
H-H-He's not coming out...

103
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:45,935
Shen Long isn't coming out. Why not?

104
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:49,965
Why isn't Shen Long blasting out of there?

105
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:52,975
Maybe the incantation is a little different.

106
00:13:53,015 --> 00:13:57,975
–Shen Long, come forth!
<i>–Those dirty punks! What are they doing?</i>
–Please grant us our wish!

107
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:00,115
Maybe his name isn't Shen Long.

108
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:04,985
That's strange.

109
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:09,985
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, someone is coming this way!

110
00:14:10,025 --> 00:14:14,995
Hey, I can feel two <i>ki</i>!
Is it those two Ginyu guys?

111
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:19,035
If so, does that mean that Father was beaten?

112
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,905
<i>Things are turning for the worse again!</i>

113
00:14:23,075 --> 00:14:25,705
They're evil <i>ki</i>! There's no mistake,

114
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,305
it has to be those two from before!

115
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:30,005
W-What happened to Goku, then?

116
00:14:30,045 --> 00:14:32,175
We've got to suppress our
own <i>ki</i> and take cover, Gohan!

117
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:33,985
Right!

118
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:06,375
The Dragon Balls have been dug up!

119
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:08,755
What's going on?

120
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:17,865
How did anyone know where they were buried?

121
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:21,995
Goku!

122
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:25,335
It's me, it's me! You sure surprised me!

123
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:30,505
I thought, "Ginyu! It must
be that Ginyu guy coming!"

124
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:33,705
I didn't know you had beat him,

125
00:15:33,745 --> 00:15:36,005
and convinced his pal
to come over to our side.

126
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:39,575
Are you the one that
found the Dragon Balls here?

127
00:15:39,615 --> 00:15:41,945
How did you know where they were?

128
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:44,355
What are you talking about, Goku?

129
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:47,785
I used the Dragon Radar to find them, of course.

130
00:15:47,825 --> 00:15:50,925
Radar, did he say? Damn,
they've got something like that?

131
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:54,065
So, have you gotten your wish granted then?

132
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:56,265
That's the funny thing. It didn't work.

133
00:15:56,305 --> 00:16:01,105
Shen Long won't appear. I can't figure out why.

134
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:05,435
The password may be
different from what we use on Earth.

135
00:16:05,475 --> 00:16:08,105
So, it didn't work, huh?

136
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:13,585
Goku, is something wrong
with you? Something about you...

137
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,585
It just doesn't seem right.

138
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:20,955
And how come you're wearing
that Scouter, or whatever it's called?

139
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:22,955
You really want to know?

140
00:16:22,995 --> 00:16:26,695
Kuririn<i>-san</i>! That isn't Father!

141
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:30,865
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, run!

142
00:16:40,645 --> 00:16:45,915
So, there's another one of you, huh?
I didn't get any reading on my Scouter.

143
00:16:45,955 --> 00:16:50,655
Apparently you can control your
battle power all the way down to zero.

144
00:16:50,695 --> 00:16:53,825
What do you think you're doing, Goku?!

145
00:16:53,865 --> 00:16:57,315
It's not Father! That isn't Father there!

146
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:05,265
I-If that isn't Goku, then what's going on?

147
00:17:05,305 --> 00:17:06,965
He looks just like him!

148
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:11,915
I don't know, but I can just tell.

149
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:28,125
I've switched bodies. This one
was so much stronger, you see.

150
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:30,955
What?!

151
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:34,525
<i>H-He's switched bodies?</i>

152
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,905
That's right.

153
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:50,245
Red Magma of the Ginyu Special Corps, Jheese!

154
00:17:56,725 --> 00:18:08,295
And I am... Commander of the
Ginyu Special Corps... Ginyu<i>-sama</i>!

155
00:18:11,805 --> 00:18:18,575
D-Damn... This unfamiliar body
makes it hard to read <i>ki</i>, as well.

156
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:21,905
"Unfamiliar body?"That's right!

157
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:29,385
If I ain't used to this body, he
shouldn't be used to my body, either!

158
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:34,125
You've switched bodies? That's impossible!

159
00:18:34,165 --> 00:18:37,195
I think I'll test it out right now.

160
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:43,865
The incredible power of a
better-than-180,000 battle power!

161
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:48,265
D-Don't do it, Goku!
You're being controlled somehow!

162
00:18:48,305 --> 00:18:51,075
You've been hypnotized or something!

163
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:06,455
<i>Whether he's actually switched</i>
<i>bodies, or has just been hypnotized,</i>

164
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:09,885
<i>Kakarrot's strength would still be the same.</i>

165
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:13,455
<i>Things are getting worse and worse!</i>

166
00:19:16,965 --> 00:19:20,095
I'm going to keep increasing
my power even higher and higher!

167
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:22,005
I hope you're ready!

168
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:32,445
Commander Ginyu! That
other bastard followed us here.

169
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,315
What?

170
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:38,355
I've found you!

171
00:19:55,905 --> 00:19:59,205
You've done well to make it this far.

172
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:04,315
I should have made the wound more severe.

173
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:07,845
K-Kuririn, Gohan, listen up!

174
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:12,685
That ain't me! He's taken over my body!

175
00:20:16,895 --> 00:20:19,295
You mean, it's true?

176
00:20:19,335 --> 00:20:22,865
I-I-It can't be!

177
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:25,865
That's Father?

178
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:29,005
<i>Yahoo!</i>

179
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:31,375
<i>Yum, yum!</i>

180
00:20:32,715 --> 00:20:37,145
I couldn't stand that!

181
00:20:37,185 --> 00:20:41,845
That guy is Ginyu!
Don't hesitate to take him down!

182
00:20:41,885 --> 00:20:44,755
There's no way he can
defeat you at your present levels!

183
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:48,055
Go on, start beating on him!

184
00:20:48,095 --> 00:20:51,185
S-Start beating on him, you say?

185
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:57,835
Fool! You think I cannot defeat
them? This was originally your body!

186
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,335
It's battle power is over 180,000.

187
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,075
There's no reason why
that would have changed!

188
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:10,205
You'll see, once you give it
a try. That's my body there.

189
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:14,845
How do you even expect to
use its <i>ki</i> well, let alone <i>Kaio-ken</i>?

190
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:21,025
If body and mind ain't completely
united, you won't get any great power!

191
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:25,195
Your lies won't work on Ginyu<i>-sama.</i>

192
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:28,365
I'll show you what my
battle power is right now!

193
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:29,425
Jheese...

194
00:21:29,465 --> 00:21:31,095
Yes, sir!

195
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:05,025
Jheese! How high is my battle power?

196
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:19,615
<i>Just how high a battle power does Ginyu</i>
<i>have, now that he has stolen Goku's body</i>?

197
00:22:19,655 --> 00:22:24,645
<i>Moreover, will Goku be</i>
<i>able to get his own body back</i>?

198
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:48,645
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

199
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:54,485
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

200
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,855
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

201
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:05,355
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

202
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:11,865
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

203
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:15,965
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

204
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:19,475
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

205
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:22,105
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

206
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:29,615
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

207
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,715
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

208
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:35,525
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

209
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:39,555
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

210
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:45,235
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

211
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,405
<i>So sorry.</i>

212
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:52,535
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

213
00:23:55,285 --> 00:24:00,545
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

214
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:14,465
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

215
00:24:14,505 --> 00:24:16,225
<i>I'm going to fight alongside you.</i>

216
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:19,535
<i>Although, it feels kind of weird,</i>
<i>attacking my own body.</i>

217
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:23,435
<i>G-Goku! It seems like he</i>
<i>suddenly got a lot stronger!</i>

218
00:24:23,475 --> 00:24:25,405
<i>Could he be getting used to your body?</i>

219
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:27,405
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

220
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:31,215
<i>"That Ain't Me! Gohan, Don't</i>
<i>Lose Your Nerve, Hit Your Father!!"</i>

221
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:34,825
<i>I won't be beaten by you,</i>
<i>even if you do look like Father!</i>

222
00:24:34,865 --> 00:24:38,345
"Next time"
"That Ain't Me! Gohan, Don't
Lose Your Nerve, Hit Your Father!!"
