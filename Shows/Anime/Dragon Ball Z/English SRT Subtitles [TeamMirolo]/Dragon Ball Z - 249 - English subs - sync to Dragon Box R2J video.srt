<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,370
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:36,130
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,760
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,060
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,770
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,400
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,280
<i>The sky is clear</i>

<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,700
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,700
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,670
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,340
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:20,260
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,090
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,720
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,720
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,100
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,270
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,110
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,900
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:46,200
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,760
<i>Majin Boo's rampage remains unstopped.</i>

24
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,800
<i>Boo, with his overwhelming power,</i>
<i>has destroyed cities, one after the other.</i>

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,520
<i>And, incredibly, he has even turned</i>
<i>living things into clay with his magic,</i>

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,140
<i>and built his own house!</i>

27
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,780
<i>Elsewhere, Goten and</i>
<i>Trunks' training continued.</i>

28
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,120
<i>However, halfway through their</i>
<i>training, Goku's time limit arrived.</i>

29
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,640
<i>Goku placed his hopes in Goten and Trunks,</i>

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,350
<i>and cheerfully returned to the Other World.</i>

31
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,280
Let's get together again after you die!

32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:22,130
<i>"Where is Gohan!?</i>
<i>Ferocious Training in the Kaioshin Realm."</i>

33
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,860
Wow, the number of dead is incredible!

34
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:12,760
So, are you sure you were right
leaving the Earth up to those little guys?

35
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,560
Yeah! Knowing them, it'll be okay!

36
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,770
If they can just master Fusion,
they'll defeat Majin Boo for sure.

37
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,940
You were right.

38
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,610
The Earth should be protected
by those who live on the Earth.

39
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,760
Okay, Goku, you can go the
rest of the way by yourself, right?

40
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,930
Yeah! Thank you, Ba-<i>chan</i>!

41
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,310
See you later, Goku!

42
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,270
Ba-<i>chan</i>, you come see
me once in a while! See you!

43
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,330
Hey, you there! No line-jumping
is allowed! No line-jumping!

44
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,960
Please stay in your place!

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,960
What in the world is going on here oni?

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
You...!

47
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,420
Sorry! Excuse me!

48
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,800
Oni...

49
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,980
Okay, next!

50
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,350
Yama-<i>san...</i>

51
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,310
Yama-<i>san</i>!

52
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,320
Oh, is that Son Goku?
You're back awfully soon.

53
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,780
Say, Yama-<i>san</i>, I got
something I need to ask you.

54
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,240
What the hell is going on down on Earth?

55
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,710
Just look at the number of dead here!

56
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,340
On top of these, they just keep
coming one after the other like that!

57
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,100
Well, a lot is going on.

58
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,350
It's possible that every
Earthling will be coming here.

59
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,100
What?!

60
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,200
More importantly, just before all these
Earthlings started coming here like this,

61
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,200
did a Son Gohan die and
come through here? He's my son.

62
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,290
Son Gohan? Just a moment...

63
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,090
Son... Son... Son...

64
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,760
Son Gohan...?

65
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,390
No, he hasn't come.

66
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,180
After all, being your son,
I'd probably know it right away,

67
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,270
and I'd have some memory of him.

68
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,270
He hasn't come? Which means...!

69
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,190
He ain't dead! You don't say, you don't say!

70
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,740
Never mind him, there was this
awful guy that came through earlier!

71
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,330
This Dabura,
King of the Demon Realm guy!

72
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,370
Dabura?

73
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,080
You know, to think that guy would die...

74
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,290
Ordinarily, I would have
naturally sent him to Hell,

75
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,250
but Hell is a lot like the Demon Realm.

76
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:38,180
He would have just been thrilled if I sent
him to Hell, so I sent him to Heaven instead!

77
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:38,720
"Heaven"

78
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,640
That's great!

79
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,060
Thank you, Yama-<i>san</i>!

80
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,770
Yahoo!

81
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,110
Gohan is alive!

82
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,820
It's just like that girl Videl said!

83
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,120
He came out safely against
Majin Boo! Not too bad, Gohan!

84
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,290
You know something,

85
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,050
seeing as how we didn't feel
Gohan's <i>ki</i> at all, what does that mean?

86
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,270
Th-That's Gohan... It is!
Unmistakable! That's Gohan's <i>ki</i>!

87
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:29,690
But why would Gohan's <i>ki</i> be in
a place like this? Huh? Where is it?

88
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,150
It ain't in here, nor in the Kaio Realm.
So, where in the world...?

89
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,480
All right, then...!

90
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,360
F-Father!

91
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:22,700
Whew, that was close, that was close!

92
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,780
W-What are you doing in that outfit?

93
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,710
It's just... there is a reason for it.

94
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,630
Is that...? Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

95
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,090
And that what's-his-name old guy,
who's supposed to be dead, to boot!

96
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,890
W-What is this?!

97
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,720
Yet another human has
entered this holy region?!

98
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,060
So anyway, where in the world are we?

99
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,690
Father, how about you? Why are you here?

100
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:56,730
It hasn't even been 24 hours yet, right?

101
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:59,110
Yeah, about that...

102
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,070
Is that so?

103
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,160
Majin Boo has torn up
the Earth just that much.

104
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:13,290
That cursed Majin Boo!

105
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,100
Let me borrow that sword for a minute.

106
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,640
The Z-Sword, did you call it?

107
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,640
Okay.

108
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,310
Please be careful. It's heavy.

109
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,980
All right!

110
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,740
You're right! This is incredibly heavy!

111
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,910
You see?

112
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:03,630
And this... will give you...
fantastic power? Awesome!

113
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:08,010
<i>I-Impossible! This man is also just</i>
<i>swinging the Z-Sword around easily?!</i>

114
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,470
<i>What sort of people are these Saiyans?!</i>

115
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,150
Say, Kaioshin-<i>sama,</i>
do you suppose it would be okay

116
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,110
if I stayed here until Gohan
goes to fight Majin Boo?

117
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,080
Sure, I do not mind.

118
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,160
And I hate to ask, but could you
give me something to eat right off?

119
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,120
I'm starving!

120
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,670
V-Very well, Gohan-<i>san</i>, will
you take a short break as well?

121
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,500
Yes.

122
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,420
I shall lead the way. Please come with me.

123
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,060
So, it must be incredible, this Super Saiyan 3!

124
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,520
Yeah, it is awesome! Once we've
eaten something, I'll show you, Gohan!

125
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,910
<i>Since then, one day's time has nearly passed.</i>

126
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,850
Get up!! How long are you planning to sleep?!

127
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,940
Yow-ow-ow-ow!

128
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,990
Okay, as soon as you've washed
your faces and eaten something,

129
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,870
it's back to training! Got that?!

130
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,820
Yeah...

131
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,880
Listen! In one day, you must
fully master Fusion, no matter what!

132
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,960
Get enthusiastic about it! Enthusiastic!

133
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,940
Come... on... you... two!!

134
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,690
Yow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow...

135
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,780
He didn't have to slug us!

136
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,660
In a critical time like this,
you guys don't have enough time!

137
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,330
You two are the only ones
now who can save the Earth!

138
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:43,790
Now pull yourselves together!

139
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,960
Piccolo is sure all fired up, huh?

140
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,630
All right, we're resuming the training!

141
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,220
Over here!

142
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,680
W-What?

143
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,680
The training is fine and all, but before that,

144
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,640
show us the proper Fusion Pose once again.

145
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:06,690
After all, we've only had it
properly shown to us one time so far!

146
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,690
That's right, that's right!

147
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,780
If we don't have an accurate
example shown to us, we can't learn it!

148
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,240
–Okay?
–Okay?

149
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,330
Kuririn, give me a hand!

150
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,210
M-Me?!

151
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:28,710
You saw that much yesterday.
You remember the Pose, of course.

152
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,260
Th-That may be true, but why me?

153
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,180
Everyone else here saw that Pose too!

154
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,260
That's a dirty trick! Huh? Hey! Where are you?

155
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,270
Kuririn!

156
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,020
All right! I'll do it! I just have to do it, right?

157
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,240
Ready? Watch closely!

158
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,240
Right!

159
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,700
A-As I remember, it was like this, right?

160
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,870
Here goes, Kuririn!

161
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,200
Y-Yeah...

162
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:13,260
"Fu–"

163
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,800
"–sion!"

164
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,550
"Ha!!"

165
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,640
W-We're doing that ridiculous-looking thing?!

166
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,640
It's embarrassing!

167
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,270
I'm embarrassed too, you know!

168
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:32,230
W-We're doing this because you guys
said you wanted to see it, didn't you?

169
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,650
Come on! Quit griping,
and let's start training again!

170
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,860
Okay...

171
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,490
Can you believe this?

172
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:46,870
Two-thirds of the Earth's urban population
has already been eradicated by Majin Boo!

173
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:52,630
At this rate the Earth will become
a dead planet in less than a day!

174
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,880
W-What?!

175
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,260
Next!

176
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,150
Not even one of you gets away!

177
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,710
Good day! Who's there?

178
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,220
Can't you tell by looking? I'm–

179
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:44,220
I'm sorry. I cannot see.

180
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,230
Say, who are you? Are you a famous person?

181
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:52,190
You're a dummy. You just have
your eyes closed. Open them up!

182
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,860
I can't see even if they are open!

183
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,030
That's what kind of disease it is.

184
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,150
Ever since I was born, see?

185
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,910
Is that it? You can't get
scared that way. All right!

186
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,170
What have you done?

187
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,220
Dummy! Try opening your eyes!

188
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,220
But, even if I open them–

189
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,140
Just open them!

190
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,030
I can see... I can see!

191
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:47,240
I can see. I can see! M-My eyes, I can see!

192
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,170
It's no dream! I really can see!

193
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,210
Now, look at me!

194
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,670
Thank you...

195
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,140
Thank you, mister!
Really, thank you! I can see!

196
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,970
I can see!

197
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,720
He's not scared.

198
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,150
So, mister, are you from a foreign country?

199
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,070
Foreign country?

200
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:29,990
Yeah. I mean, we don't have that
kind of thing attached to our heads.

201
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,540
Hey!

202
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,170
Do I look cool?

203
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,300
I'm not really sure,
but yeah, I guess you're cool.

204
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,180
After all, you healed my
eyes for me with your magic.

205
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,520
I'm cool! I'm cool!

206
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,150
I know! I'll give you my money as thanks!

207
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,980
Money?

208
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,110
I was going to buy milk with it,
but all the stores were closed.

209
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,110
There it is! Here!

210
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,540
It's yucky!

211
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,050
You wait here.

212
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,060
Incredible! People from
other countries can fly!

213
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,170
Majin Boo!

214
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,920
You turn into milk!

215
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,540
He came back!

216
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:50,090
Hey, money is yucky. Milk is yummier!

217
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,100
Um, er...

218
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,140
You take it.

219
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,600
Thanks!

220
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,900
Um, thank you!

221
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,240
Really! Really, thank you!

222
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:29,340
Money is yucky! Milk is yummy!
Money is yucky! Milk is yummy!

223
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,280
I am cool!

224
