6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,160

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,950
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,870
<i>The monster Cell exhibited frightening power!</i>

17
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,920
<i>Piccolo had fallen, as had Tenshinhan.</i>

18

<i>However, at the last possible</i>

19
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,060
I'd like to settle everything right here,

20
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:50,070
but no matter how you shake it up,
there ain't no way I can win the way I am now.

21
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,240
However, just you wait one more day,

22
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,280
and I'll be sure to thoroughly
defeat you, you'll see!

23
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,460
<i>Goku and the others escaped to the temple...</i>

24
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,460
<i>...using the Instantaneous Movement technique.</i>

25
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,050
Right now, Son Goku does not matter!

26
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,260
I have to catch No. 18!

27
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,010
<i>Burning with ambition, and</i>
<i>having already absorbed No. 17,</i>

28
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:24,390
<i>the evolved Cell took off after No. 18.</i>

29
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:33,360
<i>"I Will Dispose of Everything!!</i>
<i>A Reborn Vegeta, Father and Son, Sally Forth."</i>

30
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,870
Please excuse us. We've kept you waiting.

31
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,540
We've really been waiting for this!

32
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,090
–Trunks-<i>san</i>!
–Trunks, you've really gotten all strong, huh?

33
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,060
You been in quite long time.

34
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,020
Popo not know anyone been in this long.

35
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
Once we entered, Dad appeared

36
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,440
to have already overcome the
Super Saiyan wall in two months.

37
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,860
But even then, he didn't appear to be satisfied,

38
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,650
and all the time up to now has been–

39
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,860
Trunks!

40
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,030
Don't say what you don't have to.

41
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,010
It went pretty well, huh Vegeta?

42
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,720
Hmph, I suppose.

43
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,430
But even if you were to go in
now and train, it won't do any good,

44
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,440
because I'm going to dispose of everything–

45
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,440
including Cell and the Artificial Humans.

46
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,770
What?!

47
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,030
Vegeta, I don't know how
strong you may have gotten,

48
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,070
but you're taking them too lightly.

49
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,030
While you were in that room,

50
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,870
Cell absorbed the Artificial Human
No. 17, and has gotten even stronger!

51
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,250
You'll be surprised at his strength.

52
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,440
Vegeta, I went and saw the
evolved Cell myself for just a moment.

53
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,820
He was one abominable monster!

54
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,260
This is no time to be playing around!

55
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,010
We have to hurry to Kami-<i>sama</i>'s temple!

56
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,180
Trunks, we're speeding up!

57
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,110
That's it!

58
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,720
He looks like he's angry
about something. Oh well.

59
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,740
Damn that wretched No. 18!

60
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,030
Where did she vanish to?

61
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,080
She's together with that injured No. 16.

62
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,540
They couldn't have gotten too far.

63
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:40,480
That miserable Cell! Aren't you upset, No. 16?!

64
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,870
You really are a strange one!

65
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,210
I don't have any idea what it is you're thinking!

66
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,040
You tried to help us.

67
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,460
You, who were built solely for killing Son Goku.

68
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,430
So this is Kami-<i>sama</i>'s temple, huh?

69
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:28,450
Hey there, everyone!

70
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,040
Where are you? If you're here, come on out!

71
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,240
That's Bulma-<i>san</i>'s voice!

72
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,040
They're here, they're here!

73
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
Bulma, why are you here?

74
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,670
I asked Kuririn.

75
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,590
He said you were all here.

76
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,800
Good day!

77
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,390
Huh?

78
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,650
Say, say there, you're Trunks, aren't you?

79
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,860
–You are, right?
–Uh... Right...

80
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,860
Why has your hairstyle changed?

81
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,280
Is it a wig?

82
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,450
Whoa, and haven't you gotten taller?

83
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,450
T-There is a mysterious room
in Kami-<i>sama</i>'s temple here,

84
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:15,870
where one year inside is
the same as one day outside.

85
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,870
Me and Dad trained together in that room...

86
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,880
Huh?

87
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,460
But hey, even taking that into account,
Vegeta's hair hasn't gotten any longer, has it?

88
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,880
The hair of a pure Saiyan does not

89
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,890
undergo any weird changes
from the time they're born.

90
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,430
–Yeah?
–Is that so?

91
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,810
So that's why I've always had–

92
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,430
Haven't you ever noticed up until now?

93
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,020
Yeah, I've always thought
it was a little strange, but still...

94
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,860
You amaze me.

95
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,530
This is no time for you to be
speaking about things of no importance!

96
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,030
Why the hell have you come here, Bulma?!

97
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,360
Right, right. I'd forgotten.

98
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,870
See, that battle suit that
Vegeta requested to be made?

99
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,790
It's got an incredible defensive capacity, right?

100
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,830
So, I had them made for everybody
and brought them here! See?

101
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Wow, this takes me back!

102
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,430
These are the clothes I wore on Planet Namek!

103
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,180
This is unexpectedly light, huh?

104
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,770
So this is a Saiyan battle suit?

105
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,770
It took a lot of effort for me to make
them out of the same material, you know!

106
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,440
As I might have expected of Bulma-<i>san</i>!

107
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,780
No, no, you flatter me!

108
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,360
Huh? Aren't you guys going to wear them?

109
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,790
I have no inclination to wear the
same clothes as Freeza or the Saiyans.

110
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,370
Me either.

111
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,160
I'd die before wearing
the same clothes as Vegeta.

112
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,380
Don't be so particular!

113
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,710
It's pretty easy to move around in this!

114
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:57,100
Like I said before, Kakarrot,
there's no use in you wearing that outfit.

115
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,100
You will have no active part in this.

116
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,190
Because you're going to
defeat that monster Cell, right?

117
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,770
If so, that will be best!

118
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,780
So then, why don't I go beat Cell now?

119
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,200
Shall I take you to him with
my Instantaneous Movement?

120
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,210
Don't be absurd. I will not
be making use of your powers.

121
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,660
See you later.

122
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,090
My, my. He's as obstinate as ever.

123
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,770
Well then, I will be going too.

124
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,220
Yeah. Oh, just a second...

125
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,780
Vegeta's and your share of
the senzu. Take them with you.

126
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,190
I am most thankful for them.

127
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,070
Good luck. But don't overdo it.

128
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,780
If it gets dicey, get out
of there right away! Got it?

129
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,660
Yes. Thank you for everything.

130
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,460
Goku-<i>san</i>, good luck with your training as well.

131
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,460
Dying is definitely out of
the question, both of you!

132
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,540
You got that?

133
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,260
All right, Gohan!

134
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,020
Now it's our turn for
some father-and-son training!

135
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,020
Right!

136
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,860
Oh, just a moment! Before we do...

137
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,030
I'm hungry!

138
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,070
I've gotta eat something first!

139
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,570
At a time like this?

140
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,960
Dammit!

141
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,130
Given No. 18's speed, I should
have overtaken her now for sure!

142
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,520
Seeing as how she is not visible,

143
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,400
she would appear to have hidden herself

144
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,530
on one of the islands around here somewhere.

145
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,880
Fine.

146
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,150
Can you hear me?! No. 18!!

147
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:58,280
Show yourself!! If you don't show yourself,

148
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,780
I'm going to destroy these
islands one after another!!

149
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,410
You got that?!

150
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:08,830
You have to hear me! No. 18!
Come on out immediately!

151
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,660
W-What's that?

152
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,420
You idiot! Where the hell
were you looking?! Come on!

153
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,840
What was that loud voice just now?

154
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,260
I-It sounded like it came
from the sky, really far away!

155
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:32,480
Listen!! No. 18!! I am not bluffing!!

156
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,400
You must be thinking that if I destroy you,

157
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:38,230
then I will not be able to
achieve my perfect form,

158
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,410
so there's no way I would do so!!

159
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,410
W-What is this?

160
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,750
That's just too bad!!

161
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:53,170
It is certainly true that
I desire to become my perfect form,

162
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,040
but even as I am now,

163
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,420
there is already no one in
the world that can oppose me!!

164
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,300
Come on out!

165
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,640
No. 18!

166
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:13,350
Hurry up and come out!

167
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,610
Cell's voice, is it?

168
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,400
To think that he would be the
one to let me know where he is.

169
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,820
Just you wait, Cell.

170
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,490
You'll know right away who
the strongest in the universe is!

171
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,090
If you do not come out,
I will destroy all these islands!!

172
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,840
You got that?!

173
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,260
You despicable piece of crap!

174
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,430
It's all right, No. 18! Don't move.

175
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,760
He may say that, but he's
not about to destroy anything.

176
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,390
He is greatly devoted to
becoming his perfect form.

177
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Lousy No. 18...

178
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,240
Not going to show yourself, huh?

179
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,830
Put me to all this trouble, will you? Idiot!

180
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,660
Well then, shall I drive
her from that island first?

181
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,300
Hey, isn't that whatever it
was that put out that loud voice?

182
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,810
Why is he floating in mid-air?

183
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,810
H-He's the devil! The devil has come!

184
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,360
It's the end of the world! It's all over!

185
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,400
It seems that No. 18 was not on that island.

186
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,820
Okay, on to the next island.

187
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,830
No. 18!! Do you still
intend not to show yourself?!

188
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:41,870
The island you are hiding on will
soon vanish, and you along with it!!

189
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,920
What do we do, No. 16?

190
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,420
He really has started destroying islands!

191
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,470
You need not worry.

192
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:54,180
Cell is attacking at a level
such that you will not die, No. 18.

193
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,560
No matter what happens,
he wants to assimilate you, No. 18.

194
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,230
Even if he does spare me, with
your injuries, you will not survive!

195
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,820
<i>Why is it that Cell is as particular as</i>
<i>this about becoming his perfect form?</i>

196
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,110
<i>He already has enough</i>
<i>power to make himself invincible.</i>

197
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,240
<i>There is no one in the entire</i>
<i>universe that can stand up to him!</i>

198
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,870
<i>Is it just that he is genuinely</i>
<i>seeking the ultimate power?</i>

199
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,100
Miserable Cell! It appears he's making
quite a show about going into action.

200
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,710
Mmm, nummy!

201
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,140
Ah! Here comes, here comes!

202
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,870
I'm full, I'm full!

203
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,250
Son Goku, that enough?

204
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,260
Yeah! I've had plenty to eat!

205
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,590
Gohan, about ready to go?

206
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,010
Yes!

207
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,680
Well then...

208
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,900
See there? Stick to it! Stick to it, Trunks!

209
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:18,490
Starting now, you've got a
great deal of working out to do!

210
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,580
Ah, here they come, here they come!

211
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,880
Indeed! You really are
happy-go-lucky about this!

212
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,470
Okay, just about time
you guys take turn entering.

213
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,680
Wonder how long you can stay in.

214
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,520
<i>It's hot...</i>

215
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:12,650
<i>At last, Son Goku and Son Gohan</i>
<i>enter the Room of Spirit and Time.</i>

216
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,690
<i>Will they be able to surpass even Super Saiyan,</i>

217
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:23,570
<i>and gain enough power to</i>
<i>exceed the fearsome monster Cell?</i>

218
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:47,720
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

219
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,560
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

220
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,940
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

221
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,450
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

222
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,960
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

223
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,040
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

224
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,550
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

225
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:21,170
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

226
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:28,720
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

227
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,810
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

228
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,600
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

229
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,650
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

230
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:44,320
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

231
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,490
<i>So sorry.</i>

232
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:51,620
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

233
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,630
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

234
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,060
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

235
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:15,020
<i>What do you think, Gohan? Pretty cool room, huh?</i>

236
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,940
<i>My training will be more rigorous</i>
<i>than Piccolo's, so brace yourself.</i>

237
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,730
<i>Standing before Cell,</i>
<i>Dad's ki is rising incredibly.</i>

238
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,450
<i>He's planning to surpass</i>
<i>Super Saiyan right away!</i>

239
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,280
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

240
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,240
<i>"Suddenly Full-Throttle!!</i>
<i>The Super Power of a Radiant Vegeta."</i>

241
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,490
<i>Incredible! That's the result of his training?</i>

242
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,000
"Next time"
"Suddenly Full-Throttle!!
The Super Power of a Radiant Vegeta"
