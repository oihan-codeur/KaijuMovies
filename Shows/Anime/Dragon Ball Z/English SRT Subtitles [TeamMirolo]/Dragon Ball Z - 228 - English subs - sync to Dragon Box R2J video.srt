1
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:24,715
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:30,345
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:36,065
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:41,695
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,705
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:57,335
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,215
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,255 --> 00:01:03,045
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:05,635
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:08,635
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:11,645
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,685 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:20,195
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:23,025
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,655
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,695 --> 00:01:28,655
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:31,035
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:34,205
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,045
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,875
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:46,135
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:56,225 --> 00:02:02,195
<i>At Stage 3, it was Dabura who</i>
<i>stood in the way of Goku and the others.</i>

24
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:06,445
<i>Gohan challenged the demonic</i>
<i>king with his power wide open.</i>

25
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:55,575
<i>However, upon feeling the evil in</i>
<i>Vegeta's heart, Dabura abandoned the fight.</i>

26
00:02:55,615 --> 00:02:57,375
<i>Babidi is planning to use Vegeta,</i>

27
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:02,415
<i>causing Goku and the others</i>
<i>to fight amongst themselves.</i>

28
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:13,055
<i>"Vegeta, Prince of Destruction, Revived!!</i>
<i>Intrusion at the Tournament."</i>

29
00:03:58,185 --> 00:04:04,475
<i>Dabura... someone supposed to be a</i>
<i>demonic king, has abandoned the fight?</i>

30
00:04:07,645 --> 00:04:10,155
What on earth could his intention be?

31
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:13,405
It's you whose intention I want to know!

32
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:23,795
How could you fail to
take down a guy of his level?!

33
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:26,795
If you were even a paltry member of
our fighting race, once you started a fight,

34
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:31,135
you'd make sure to take your
opponent's last breath from them!!

35
00:04:31,175 --> 00:04:33,255
You're all too soft!!

36
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:38,635
Every one of you, fighting behind
the mask of justice–it disgusts me!

37
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:40,515
It's power that commands the fight!

38
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:43,815
The strong are the only ones
who survive, while the weak die!

39
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:46,435
Power is everything!

40
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:48,645
But–

41
00:04:48,685 --> 00:04:50,525
Take a look at Piccolo and them!

42
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:53,525
It's only because they were weak
that they were turned to stone!

43
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,035
Hmph! They're a disgrace!

44
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:03,705
<i>That's right! If I'd only defeated Dabura,</i>

45
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:08,375
<i>Piccolo-san and Kuririn-san would</i>
<i>have been returned to normal...</i>

46
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:19,805
Let it stand at that, Vegeta. Gohan
did everything he could, after all.

47
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,565
Like I told you, Kakarrot!

48
00:05:24,605 --> 00:05:27,065
I want to put an end to this playing around

49
00:05:27,105 --> 00:05:30,025
so I can hurry up and
settle my score with you!

50
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,065
Dammit, I'm at the limits of my patience!

51
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:37,075
Never mind Babidi, and never mind the Majin!

52
00:05:37,115 --> 00:05:39,745
I'm going to vaporize this whole spaceship!

53
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:42,745
–This is where it ends!
–That's reckless, Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

54
00:05:42,785 --> 00:05:47,415
If you do such a thing,
Majin Boo will be revived!

55
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,545
Majin Boo is a monster who
does nothing but create destruction

56
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:52,545
and slaughter again and again!

57
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:56,715
He is quite literally a demonic being, as
four of the Kaioshin were no match for him!

58
00:05:56,755 --> 00:05:58,175
Shut up!

59
00:05:58,215 --> 00:06:01,555
If Majin Boo is revived, then mankind...

60
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:05,055
no, all living things, will be put to death,

61
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:08,105
and the Earth will unmistakably
be turned into a planet of death!

62
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:10,355
Be silent!

63
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:14,445
How many people are killed...

64
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:19,575
What may happen to the Earth...
It's no concern of mine!

65
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:21,945
What kind of person are you?

66
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,745
Why don't you cut it out, Vegeta?!

67
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,415
Kakarrot!

68
00:06:39,255 --> 00:06:43,475
Still, something strange has happened, huh?

69
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:46,105
Yeah. This should have been
the perfect chance for them

70
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:49,935
to obtain the energy they
need for Majin Boo's revival.

71
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:53,105
So why did Dabura...?

72
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:57,115
I ain't sure what it means, but
I'm certain he said something like

73
00:06:57,155 --> 00:07:03,325
"I myself do not need to fight,
I've found a good warrior."

74
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:18,675
Found... a warrior...

75
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:23,095
H-He can't mean...!

76
00:07:41,195 --> 00:07:45,995
You're right! He's different from the others!

77
00:07:46,035 --> 00:07:51,035
It's just as you said. His
heart is filled with wickedness!

78
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:54,965
He hasn't come here for any just cause at all!

79
00:07:55,005 --> 00:07:56,505
Right.

80
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:59,675
Bravo, bravo, Dabura!

81
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,465
So then, let us have them
fight amongst themselves.

82
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:10,395
The energy we obtain from them
will most assuredly revive Majin Boo.

83
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:16,895
We're going to have you serve us!

84
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,395
Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

85
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:12,705
–Dammit!
–I knew it!

86
00:09:40,985 --> 00:09:43,945
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, what on Earth is...?

87
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:46,485
Vegeta-<i>san</i>! Shake it off!

88
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:50,945
Babidi is attempting to
use the evil in your heart!

89
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:55,455
Babidi using... the evil in his heart...?

90
00:09:55,495 --> 00:10:01,465
That's right! Madoshi Babidi can
manipulate the evil-hearted at will!

91
00:10:01,505 --> 00:10:05,385
You can't mean...
the warrior Dabura found is...?

92
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:17,475
Vegeta-<i>san</i>, empty your mind!
You must not think of anything!

93
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:21,355
W-Worthless fool! That's easy for you to say...!

94
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:30,365
Good, good! You're ours now!

95
00:10:32,535 --> 00:10:34,495
All right, while we're at it,

96
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:40,375
let's also draw out his hidden
power, beyond his limits!

97
00:11:07,905 --> 00:11:10,365
W-What's this?

98
00:11:23,915 --> 00:11:26,045
<i>Incredible power!</i>

99
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,755
<i>Vegeta-san!</i>

100
00:11:29,085 --> 00:11:33,425
No, Vegeta-<i>san</i>! Don't let
that guy manipulate you!

101
00:11:36,555 --> 00:11:38,435
Gohan!

102
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,185
Vegeta-<i>san...</i>

103
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,795
What a <i>ki</i>! I can't get near it!

104
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,465
<i>Babidi, you...!</i>

105
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:12,735
Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

106
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:15,865
Vegeta...

107
00:13:15,905 --> 00:13:18,325
Hey, Vegeta!

108
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,325
Please, wait!

109
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,505
It's too late!

110
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:34,385
I-It can't be...

111
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:18,885
I'm Champion!

112
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,885
Way to go, Mister Satan!

113
00:14:21,925 --> 00:14:25,435
Yea, Mister Satan! You're so cool!

114
00:15:19,315 --> 00:15:21,445
We cannot allow you in
the ring! Please go back!

115
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:25,455
Everyone, please return
and sit in your seats at once!

116
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:26,325
Sit down, if you please!

117
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:42,465
Vegeta!

118
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:45,805
Vegeta-<i>san</i>, snap out of it! Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

119
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:48,095
I never...

120
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:51,765
I never expected Babidi to go
about setting us up against each other!

121
00:16:05,405 --> 00:16:10,705
Great, great! He is now my servant!

122
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:14,045
Why don't I let them fight somewhere nice?

123
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:17,375
Papparapa!

124
00:16:17,415 --> 00:16:22,175
–W-What?
–He's about to move us to another location.

125
00:16:41,905 --> 00:16:44,235
We're at...

126
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:46,445
...the Tournament grounds.

127
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:55,375
<i>This is no apparition, this is</i>
<i>unmistakably the Tournament grounds!</i>

128
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:57,375
W-What's with them?

129
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:59,375
They just suddenly appeared!

130
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:03,385
Goku! No doubt about it,
it's Goku and the others!

131
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:05,095
What's happening here?

132
00:17:09,885 --> 00:17:12,225
Goku-<i>sa</i>! And Gohan too!

133
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,895
Vegeta!

134
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:24,115
Unbelievable! Now they come
back to the Tenkaichi Tournament,

135
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:26,405
when the winner's already been decided!

136
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,405
What am I goin' to do
about the family budget?

137
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:30,785
I know!

138
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:35,245
Just beat up Mister Satan
now and take the prize money!

139
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:36,415
That's preposterous!

140
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,585
Preposterous? If he beats
the Champion to a pulp,

141
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,795
in front of everyone here,
no one's goin' to object!

142
00:17:42,835 --> 00:17:45,425
I-I suppose that's true...

143
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:49,635
Hmm? W-Wait a second,
there's something strange here.

144
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:05,155
You're a bit late, aren't you, party of Son-<i>san</i>?

145
00:18:05,195 --> 00:18:07,405
Where on Earth have you been?

146
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:10,995
Watch out!

147
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:38,645
So, what was his name again? Er...

148
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:44,655
Right, right, right! Vegeta!
Take the energy from those guys!

149
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:48,655
Battle with all your might!
You can even kill them if you want!

150
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:55,535
Silence! My only objective is Kakarrot!
I don't care about anyone else!

151
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:58,165
Vegeta... you...

152
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:04,505
How about that guy? He still
isn't completely under my control!

153
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:10,635
This is a first! Well, I guess it's okay...

154
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:12,805
V-V-Vegeta!

155
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:16,595
Vegeta! What the hell is he thinking?

156
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:27,065
<i>Th-Th-They're... those guys from...</i>
<i>those guys from that one time...</i>

157
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:33,535
<i>Y-You mean... th-they survived?</i>

158
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:56,475
H-Hey!

159
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:01,975
What?

160
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,645
You idiot!

161
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:45,145
Aw, hell!

162
00:20:47,815 --> 00:20:49,645
Oh, no!

163
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:22,685
Unbelievable!

164
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:29,065
Th-This can't be!

165
00:21:33,985 --> 00:21:37,445
It's not true! This is some
kind of mistake... Vegeta...

166
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:06,725
Vegeta...

167
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:24,415
<i>Vegeta has been controlled by Babidi!</i>
<i>Is this the fateful confrontation at last?</i>

168
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:38,795
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

169
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:45,385
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

170
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:55,945
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

171
00:22:55,985 --> 00:23:02,075
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

172
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:09,085
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

173
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:14,465
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

174
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,295
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

175
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:27,395
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

176
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,935
<i>Even now?</i>

177
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:36,565
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

178
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:41,945
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

179
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:48,455
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

180
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:58,465
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

181
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,605
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

182
00:24:15,645 --> 00:24:18,235
<i>Babidi! Change us to a place</i>
<i>where no one else is around!</i>

183
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:21,275
<i>I have decided to fight Vegeta!</i>

184
00:24:21,315 --> 00:24:23,235
<i>They've started fighting amongst themselves!</i>

185
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:26,205
<i>The return of the Majin is</i>
<i>now just a matter of time.</i>

186
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:28,365
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

187
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:32,625
<i>"The Super-confrontation of Destiny!!</i>
<i>The Clash of Goku vs. Vegeta."</i>

188
00:24:32,665 --> 00:24:36,795
<i>Vegeta-san did it on purpose,</i>
<i>so that he could fight Father!</i>

189
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:39,585
"Next time"
"The Super-confrontation of Destiny!!
The Clash of Goku vs. Vegeta"
