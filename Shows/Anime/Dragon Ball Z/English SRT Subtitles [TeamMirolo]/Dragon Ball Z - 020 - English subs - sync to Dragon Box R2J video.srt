00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,110
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,360
<i>Less than five months</i>

17
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,360

18

<i>which was a planet that had</i>
<i>ten times the gravity of Earth!</i>

20
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,380
First off, you have to
conquer the harsh gravity here.

21
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,980
Catch Bubbles<i>-kun</i> here, if you can.

22
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,940
<i>The chase went on for three weeks.</i>

23
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,050
I finally did it!

24
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,290
I caught him!

25
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,570
<i>He's as amazing as I thought.</i>
<i>He's already overcome the gravity here, has he?</i>

<i>"The Saiyan Legend Reborn!</i>
<i>Goku's Roots."</i>

27
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,250
I did it!

28
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,310
I did it! I did it! I did it! I did it!

29
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,450
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, what should I do next?

30
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:39,460
What should you do? Let's see...
You'll polish off whatever I give you, right?

31
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,460
Uh-huh.

32
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,830
Even apple-polishing?

33
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,040
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, I have to train fast,
before the Saiyans arrive...

34
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,910
Take it easy.

35
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,080
There are still 135 days left.

36
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,210
That ain't hardly time
enough to catch my breath.

37
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,970
W-What are you doing?

38
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,430
It's about time for it to come back.

39
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,310
Come back?

40
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,700
Here it comes.

41
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,720
It takes quite a while
to catch one's breath, huh?

42
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,020
That's great, that's great!

43
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,230
Are you sure you're all that strong?

44
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,760
How rude!

45
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,480
W-What was that?

46
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,050
It looks like a cricket.

47
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,610
C-Cricket?

48
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,680
That's "crickediculous!"

49
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,620
–Oh, nice one!
–You are so disrespectful!

50
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,660
I am Gregory, the one
who looks after Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

51
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,660
You dare face the man
who stands at the head of all

52
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,800
the gods throughout
the universe, Kaio<i>-sama...</i>

53
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,030
"That's crickediculous!"

54
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,180
Ahem... You dare face
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, and ask him,

55
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,610
"Are you sure you're all that strong?"

56
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,610
I can only put up with so much
shamelessness from such a whippersnapper!

57
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,650
But I ain't even carrying a whip.

58
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,960
Son Goku, you got off a pretty good one, there!

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,560
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, this is no
time for you to be laughing.

60
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,700
This works out perfectly, Son Goku.

61
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,000
After Bubbles<i>-kun</i>, your
next opponent will be Gregory.

62
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,670
This guy?

63
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,670
What is that look on
your face supposed to mean?

64
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:09,110
But I wanted to get my training
directly from you, Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

65
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,210
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, I am absolutely infuriated!

66
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,210
If it's okay with you,

67
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,620
I would like to take this
disparager down a peg. What do you say?

68
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,220
Very well.

69
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,460
What's that?

70
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,460
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>, isn't that a little big?

71
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,030
Son Goku, here...

72
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
What do you think? Heavy, right?

73
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,410
Your next training exercise will be to
take that hammer and swat Gregory with it.

74
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,570
With this?

75
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,750
Once you manage to do that,
I will begin training you personally.

76
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,920
All right, I'll give it a try!

77
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,730
Hmph! You think a pipsqueak like
you is going to be able to catch me?

78
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,880
He's fast!

79
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,980
Dammit!

80
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,640
Looks like this is going to take a while.

81
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,270
Yow-ow-ow-ow... All right,
I'll get you this time for sure!

82
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,610
That jerk!

83
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,080
Wait up!

84
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,620
He didn't!

85
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,770
It's a good thing I'm so cheerful...

86
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,990
Get up, now!

87
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,060
Don't get too full of yourself,

88
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,030
just because you managed
to dodge me once or twice.

89
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,660
You're still too soft!

90
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,750
Help me!

91
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,200
Come back up here on your own!

92
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:50,890
Squirrel! Watermelon!
Sea gull! Killifish! Monster!

93
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:59,760
Cow! White shark!
Quince! Apple! Gorilla! Lion!

94
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,670
You say the next one!

95
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:16,820
Both Ten<i>-san</i> and Yamucha<i>-san</i>
have gotten even better!

96
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,000
Yajirobe! Take this seriously!

97
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,980
Eeyow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

98
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,300
T-Time out!

99
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:10,040
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>?

100
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,410
It's time for supper!

101
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,270
Yahoo!

102
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,340
You're really something!

103
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,540
Goku, how are you coming along?

104
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,110
Whew! He's so fast! I've never
seen anyone like this dude before!

105
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,710
"T-This dude"?

106
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,590
You may have conquered the gravity on this
planet, but now the problem is your speed.

107
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,060
The Saiyans that you have
to fight are unbelievably strong.

108
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,760
Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

109
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,390
Do you know about the Saiyans?!

110
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,560
L-Listen, you! Kaio<i>-sama</i>
stands at the head of all

111
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,530
the gods throughout the universe–

112
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,370
Gregory, it's all right.

113
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,400
Son Goku, as I recall, you said something
about yourself being a Saiyan too, right?

114
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,580
Yeah. But I don't know
anything about Saiyans.

115
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,950
Apparently, I came to Earth when I was a baby.

116
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,610
So that's how it is, huh?

117
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:32,950
In that case, let me tell you
about the history of the Saiyans.

118
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,190
Really?

119
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,790
Oh, my, thank you.

120
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:42,100
I'll just plop down here...

121
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,670
Once upon a time...

122
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,910
There were two races of people who
lived on a world named Planet Vegeta.

123
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,480
The Saiyans, who are your
forebears, and the Tsufruians.

124
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,440
Saiyans and Tsufruians?

125
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,350
Planet Vegeta, like my own planet here,
had an extremely strong gravity.

126
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,420
As a result, the Tsufruians,

127
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,790
who controlled the
larger half of Planet Vegeta,

128
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,360
were a race whose bodies were
only about half the size of the Saiyans.

129
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,360
However, they had a remarkable,

130
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,200
comparatively advanced level of civilization.

131
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,370
On the other hand, the Saiyans
were a race that was very few in numbers,

132
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,470
but their bodies were bigger,
not to mention stronger,

133
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,810
and they were an aggressive, primitive race.

134
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,340
The tails the Saiyans had were their
greatest distinguishing characteristic.

135
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,010
They were all warrior-like people, as it were.

136
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,790
At one point, these warriors bared their fangs,

137
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,200
and started to overrun the Tsufruians.

138
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:04,850
The Tsufruians greeted them with
advanced weaponry of their own making.

139
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,920
The Saiyans, who should have been
utterly outnumbered, were incredibly strong,

140
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,630
and gradually, they brought
the Tsufruians under their control.

141
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,230
The decisive factor was the full moon,

142
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:32,940
which only appeared on Planet
Vegeta once every eight years.

143
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,940
That's because when Saiyans see
the full moon, they transform into monsters.

144
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,180
For the Tsufruians,
this was their greatest threat,

145
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,120
and they suffered the most damage this way.

146
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,130
And so, little by little, as the
Tsufruian civilization pulled back,

147
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,940
the Saiyans quickly increased their numbers.

148
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,110
In time, they completely
took over Planet Vegeta.

149
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,610
Then, the Saiyans took off into space,
seeking to fight even more.

150
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,950
However, since the
Tsufruians had been exterminated,

151
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,120
further development of their
civilization was slow to occur.

152
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,830
They realized that even
though they wanted to fight,

153
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,770
they could not go out any farther into space.

154
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:39,140
So the Saiyans joined forces with rich,
advanced alien civilizations,

155
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,340
and in exchange for
furnishing planets to these aliens

156
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,570
for use in developing vacation estates,

157
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,980
they were able to obtain technology and money.

158
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,290
For the battle-hungry Saiyans,
this was killing two birds with one stone.

159
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,790
The Saiyans' activities escalated swiftly,

160
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:03,800
and they even started sending babies
to many other worlds, as was your case.

161
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,100
They had come up with long-term plans,
whereby once the baby grew up,

162
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,050
it would exterminate the planet's population.

163
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,940
That's awfully overbearing!

164
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,210
But Planet Vegeta had its own Kami.

165
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,020
He could not bear the Saiyans' evil deeds,

166
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,920
and using his own powers,
he pulled close some giant meteors,

167
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:33,330
which then collided with Planet
Vegeta, causing it to explode.

168
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,710
Including yourself, there were
only four Saiyans that survived.

169
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,080
No!

170
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,080
I ain't the same as those guys!

171
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,680
Yes, well...

172
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,920
One has died, and the other two mightiest,

173
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,800
most wicked Saiyans now
heading to Earth are the only survivors.

174
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,430
<i>I'm going to protect the Earth!</i>

175
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,770
Gregory! We've got
training! Help me out, please!

176
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:19,970
My, my, these are the first
respectful words I've heard out of you.

177
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,940
All right, I'll get you this time!

178
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,810
We'll see about that.

179
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,480
<i>I won't let the Saiyans have their way!</i>

180
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,730
Damn!

181
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,560
You have all far surpassed me.

182
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,730
There is no longer anything that
either I or Mister Popo can teach you.

183
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,770
From now until the time of battle arrives,

184
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:51,700
you should go down to the
surface and polish your techniques.

185
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,270
I leave the future to you.

186
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,940
Right!

187
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,110
So, can I take off this heavy shirt, now?

188
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,610
Do as you wish.

189
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:02,380
Guys, let's go down to
the surface and get to work!

190
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,120
We should still be able
to power ourselves up, after all.

191
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,180
Everyone, get better!

192
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:12,160
<i>Goku, I can't wait to see you again!</i>

193
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,430
<i>Hammer in hand, two weeks went by...</i>

194
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,820
<i>Almost there!</i>

195
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,020
He's persistent!

196
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:41,190
All right!

197
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,070
Oh, no!

198
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,120
Brace yourself, Gregory!

199
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,810
I did it!

200
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,690
It'd hurt if I hit you
as hard as I could, after all.

201
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,960
You sure are benign.
My body is harder than a rock.

202
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,700
You won't be able to
beat the Saiyans like that.

203
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,330
Is that right? Maybe so, but
you've still got a bump growing there.

204
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,240
<i>There are still 1 18 days remaining.</i>
<i>He just might be able to master it!</i>

205
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,080
<i>The Kaio-ken technique!</i>

206
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,590
<i>Kaio-ken, the technique</i>
<i>that I could picture in my dreams,</i>

207
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,590
<i>but was ultimately</i>
<i>unable to perform myself...</i>

208
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,190
<i>As well as that finishing move...</i>

209
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,190
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, like you promised–

210
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,560
I know you're ready for this, but my
training is harder than you can imagine!

211
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,900
Can you handle it?!

212
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,670
Mm-hmm, I'll give it a try!

213
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,170
You will be striving to be the best in
the universe, the greatest in all the world,

214
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,740
both physically and mentally. Got that?!

215
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,270
I got it!

216
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:15,550
All right, before we start...
um, care to have some tea?

217
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:24,720
Sis, I'd like you to tell the Earth's future.

218
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,730
W-What? The Earth's future?

219
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,230
I want to know what's
going to happen next year.

220
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,160
All right, I'll try to read it.

221
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:49,740
It's no use! Not even I
can tell the future this time!

222
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,160
All right, that's it!
You're starting to control your <i>ki</i>!

223
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,820
Weak!

224
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,400
<i>What kind of technique is this Kaio-ken?</i>

225
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,800
<i>And what is this finishing move?</i>

226
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,210
<i>The time of battle pitilessly drew ever nearer.</i>

227
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,670
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

228
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:53,540
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

229
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,920
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

230
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,420
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

231
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,900
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

232
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,000
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

233
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:18,500
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

234
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,170
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

235
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,680
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

236
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,750
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

237
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,590
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

238
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:38,660
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

239
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:44,330
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

240
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,500
<i>So sorry.</i>

241
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,600
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

242
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:59,580
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

243
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,020
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

244
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,190
<i>Huh? You got the wrong day?</i>

245
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,030
<i>Then I won't make it on the</i>
<i>day the Saiyans arrive! Kaio-sama!</i>

246
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,470
<i>Hmm? What's that ki? Have they finally come?</i>

247
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,370
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

248
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,110
<i>"Come Forth, Shen Long!</i>
<i>The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth."</i>

249
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:33,410
<i>Father, come quickly.</i>

250
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,260
"Next time"
"Come Forth, Shen Long!
The Saiyans Finally Arrive on Earth"
