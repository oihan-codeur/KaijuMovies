<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,960
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,300
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:52,150
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,650
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:04,660
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,120
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,630
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:26,600
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,170
<i>At last, Goku and Gohan have</i>
<i>finished their training. However...</i>

17
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,640
I will be sure to come for the matches.

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,560
So until then, don't you kill
even a single person! Got that?

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,110
Son Goku, huh?

20
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,820
It seems that this will be an even
more enjoyable event than I thought.

21
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,450
I won't know until I try,

22
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,000
but the way things are,
I probably can't win, I bet.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,170
You'd better use the
Room of Spirit and Time again.

24
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,210
There is still time.

25
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,470
No, me and Gohan have had enough.

26
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,800
What?!

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,640
We'll train in the outer world.

28
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,850
We have nine whole days,
so something will turn out.

29
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,850
W-What did you say?!

30
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,900
<i>Goku has made an unexpected declaration.</i>

31
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:03,030
<i>Does this mean that he has</i>
<i>some theory on how to beat Cell?</i>

32
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,030
<i>"Goku's Composure!?</i>
<i>Let's Rest and Wait for the Cell Games."</i>

33
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,920
You've had enough?

34
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,710
You mean you aren't going to stay in
the Room of Spirit and Time any longer?

35
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,290
Yeah, that's right.

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:29,430
Why not? You could still stay
in there for another full day.

37
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,770
Being inside there is pretty hard on the body,

38
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,390
even if you ain't doing anything.

39
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,690
You can't get enough rest like that.

40
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,860
Hmph! Well, well...

41
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,690
...has even the great Kakarrot-<i>san</i>

42
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,610
finally started to whine
about the harshness of that room?

43
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,450
Maybe so.

44
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,620
But trying to force our bodies to
get any tougher than they are now

45
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,290
would only be asking for pain.

46
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,120
And that ain't training.

47
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,880
But I ain't saying anything against
you guys going in the room again.

48
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,260
It looks like you still have room to train.

49
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,220
What was that? I don't like how that sounded.

50
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,930
From what you just said,

51
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,560
it sounds like you're saying that
your power is greater than mine.

52
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,890
Yeah. Quite a bit greater, I think.

53
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,930
What?!

54
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,280
Well, let's all hang in there together.
I'll see you again at the martial arts tournament.

55
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,420
Let's go, Gohan.

56
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,130
Right.

57
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,470
Gohan...

58
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,440
Is it okay if we stop off somewhere for a bit?

59
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Yeah...

60
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,910
Good day, Karin-<i>sama.</i>

61
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,880
Good day. It's nice to see you again.

62
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,300
Ah, you sure have grown.

63
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,130
Yo, Yajirobe! Are you back here?

64
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,050
What've ya come here for, Son?

65
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,310
I'm warnin' ya right now,
no matter what happens,

66
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,560
I ain't gonna enter that
martial arts tournament, got it?

67
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,060
That's okay!

68
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,480
I ain't asked you to enter, have I?

69
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,860
I-In that case, fine...

70
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,360
When it's all said an' done,

71
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,240
I hafta be ready to get turned to
if the worst comes 'bout, y'know?

72
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,820
If ya wanna call it that, I'm the
secret weapon guy who's held in reserve!

73
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,700
Listen to you.

74
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,830
Still, the Earth has come
to be in quite a fix, hasn't it?

75
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,210
The lower realm is in a big fuss.

76
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,170
Cell really is an awesome guy.

77
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,250
Now that he's in his perfect form,

78
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,170
he's also obtained his complete strength.

79
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,890
And you're pretty unflustered
about it, considering.

80
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,260
What is it?

81
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,060
Did you make some sort of marvelous
discovery inside the Room of Spirit and Time?

82
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,850
Oh, you know...

83
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:25,690
<i>I-Is that true?</i>

84
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,440
<i>I was there together</i>
<i>with Father the whole time...</i>

85
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,240
Say, Karin-<i>sama</i>, watching from here,

86
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,450
you can pretty much tell
what Cell's strength is, right?

87
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,910
Uh-huh.

88
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,870
He hasn't shown his true strength yet,

89
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:42,580
so I can't say for sure,
but I have a pretty good idea.

90
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,790
Well, make a comparison for me.

91
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,920
I'm going to fire up my <i>ki</i> now.

92
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,510
S-Say, were Goku and
Gohan Super Saiyans just now?

93
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:04,060
They felt so... how should I say...
natural, for being like that.

94
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,060
I don't think there's any mistake
that they were Super Saiyans.

95
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,230
However, they must have trained so
that they can maintain themselves like that

96
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,450
as if it were their usual, everyday form.

97
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,660
T-Then, when they fight,

98
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,910
they go through another,
more extraordinary transformation?

99
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,370
What are you, an idiot?

100
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,830
Apparently, you haven't
reconsidered anything, have you?

101
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,840
Kakarrot has judged that state to be best.

102
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,010
Once re-training yourself
so that it is your usual state,

103
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,470
you can get away with raising your battle power,

104
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,180
while only placing a slight burden on your body.

105
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,550
He sure thought that through!

106
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,020
I-Is that right...?

107
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,190
Transforming just to power-up
doesn't bring about anything...

108
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,400
That's why I was unable to beat Cell.

109
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,280
What is this <i>ki</i>?!

110
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,620
I-It's Goku!

111
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,690
S-Stop already!

112
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,400
Y-You're going to destroy this place!

113
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,420
Waah! Somebody!

114
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,050
That was about half of it. What do you think?

115
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,050
H-Half, you say?

116
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,430
You are one terrifying fellow!

117
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,760
How strong are you going to
get before you're finally satisfied?

118
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,440
<i>Is that so? Has Father really</i>
<i>become all that incredible?</i>

119
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,780
So, Karin-<i>sama</i>, how
about comparing that to Cell?

120
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,120
You sure ask a difficult thing.

121
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:22,170
Like I said before, I can only
make a guess as to an answer...

122
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,800
...but to be honest, I still
think that Cell has it over you.

123
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,560
He's one outrageous
bastard then, huh, this Cell?

124
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,360
Just as I thought, huh?

125
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,530
My estimate wasn't wrong, then.
Thank you, Karin-<i>sama.</i>

126
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,120
Let's go, Gohan.

127
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,870
R-Right...

128
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:01,170
S-Sorry to bother you.

129
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,600
T-They vanished! That guy
ain't even human no more, huh?

130
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:18,190
<i>Anyhow I think about it, there doesn't</i>
<i>seem to be any way for Goku to win.</i>

131
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,190
<i>So why on earth is he so composed...?</i>

132
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:25,190
<i>I can't believe that he's</i>
<i>just turned his back on this...</i>

133
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,760
Still though, what a ferocious <i>ki</i> that was!

134
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,180
However, even at that...

135
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,680
...he wasn't putting out all of his power.

136
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,350
If he were to put out all of his power...

137
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,690
Incredible!

138
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,070
He might be able to defeat Cell.

139
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,860
<i>T-That piece of crap! Kakkarot...!</i>

140
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,910
<i>He's always doing that!</i>

141
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,870
<i>He's always keeping one step ahead of me!</i>

142
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,450
<i>He really knows how to piss me off!</i>

143
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,830
<i>Just when I think I've overtaken him,</i>
<i>he pushes ahead of me!</i>

144
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,050
Piccolo! If you're going in,
then get yourself in that room now!

145
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,170
We're all waiting for you!

146
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:37,480
Let's pick up your mother and go home.

147
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,440
There, we can settle down as much as we like.

148
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,400
We'll rest for three days,
then train for three days.

149
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,070
After that, we'll rest another three days.

150
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,490
And then comes the martial arts tournament.

151
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,360
S-Say, Father...?

152
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,120
Are you sure that's okay?

153
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,040
Will we be able to beat Cell like that?

154
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,420
Well, not to worry, not to worry.

155
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,170
Come on, let's go call your mother.

156
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,510
Heya!

157
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,480
What's the matter, everyone?

158
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,020
G-Goku?

159
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,810
Yeah!

160
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,650
Are you really Goku?

161
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,190
Yes, I am! What are you saying, Old-timer?

162
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,160
So, you're Gohan? I hardly recognize you!

163
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,870
It's true!

164
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,450
T-Thanks...

165
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,870
Goku, did you hear about the martial
arts tournament that Cell is holding?

166
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,960
Yeah. I heard from Trunks.

167
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,840
I've also gone and seen Cell,
now that he's in his perfect form.

168
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,630
Y-You what?!

169
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,180
Ah! W-With that Instantaneous
Movement thing you talked about, right?

170
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,470
Yeah, that's right.
And you know, he really is strong!

171
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,760
There's no way I can match him!

172
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,490
H-Hey, you don't need to
be so modest. It's not like you.

173
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,360
I ain't being modest, it's true.

174
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,490
But you still have some breathing
room for strength, don't you?

175
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:21,620
Are you sure you're not hiding something?

176
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,590
Never mind that, where's Chichi?

177
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,340
I was planning on taking her home with us.

178
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,420
Chichi-<i>san</i> is up on the second floor.

179
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:35,050
Hey, Chichi!

180
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,390
What? Is that you, Goku-<i>sa</i>?

181
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,810
Good grief, where have
you been up until now...?

182
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,770
Yo, Chichi! Let's all go home together.

183
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,240
Mother, let's hurry and go.

184
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,450
Are you Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

185
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,450
T-That's right...

186
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:01,870
What are you saying, Chichi?

187
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,950
N-Now, Chichi-<i>san...</i>

188
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,050
W-What's goin' on with the color of your hair?!

189
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,890
Is this dyed?!

190
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,430
Yow-ow-ow-ow!

191
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,350
No, that's not it, Chichi.

192
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,190
My Gohan-<i>chan</i> has gone
and become a delinquent!

193
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,690
It's not like that, I tell you.

194
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,660
Now then, how about a little light warming-up?

195
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,350
<i>It's times like this when Freeza</i>
<i>and his father's cells come in useful.</i>

196
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:30,290
This may be nothing more
than trivial entertainment,

197
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,580
but how about I show
the humans something nice.

198
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,910
How pretty!

199
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:04,490
–What could this be?
–Shooting stars, at this time of day!

200
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,790
There's nothing to be done...!

201
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,920
Goku-<i>sa</i>?

202
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,840
Huh?

203
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,470
Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

204
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,970
Huh? Where did those two go off to?

205
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:45,030
It sure is quiet here.

206
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,160
Yeah.

207
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,790
Say, Father....

208
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,790
I'm glad.

209
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,420
How come?

210
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,880
You promised me, a long
time ago, that we'd go fishing.

211
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,880
I promised you that?

212
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,890
You know, when you first fought Vegeta.

213
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,430
Huh? When?

214
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,060
You know, that one time...

215
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,060
Kuririn!

216
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,980
Don't you remember, Goku?

217
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,740
Goku, it's too bad we're always
having to leave our fate up to you, huh?

218
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,280
Don't you die now, my friend.

219
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,500
Right!

220
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,080
Father...!

221
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,080
Gohan...

222
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,130
Once your daddy comes back alive,

223
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,790
let's go fishing or something again, okay?

224
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,470
Right?

225
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,850
So, back then, huh?

226
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,310
Since then, all we've done
is training and other stuff,

227
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,020
so we never once went fishing together.

228
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,180
Sorry about that, Gohan.

229
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,440
Goku, the truth is,

230
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,860
I need to apologize to you for something.

231
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,490
For what?

232
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,370
The reason Cell was able
to become his perfect form

233
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,290
is because I wasn't able to shut down No. 18.

234
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,290
Don't worry about that.

235
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:18,670
We're thrilled to be able to
fight against somebody this strong.

236
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,300
Somehow, it doesn't seem right, you know?

237
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,840
Always having you save us...

238
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,010
What's with you, Kuririn?
You're acting like we're strangers.

239
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,220
That's right!

240
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:31,470
It's not like you to be like this, Kuririn-<i>san.</i>

241
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:35,480
Nah. Recently, there's been so
much distance placed between us...

242
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,480
It almost seems like it couldn't be
true that we ever fought each other.

243
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,650
Really? For my part, I remember
when we trained together

244
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,570
under Old Timer Turtle Hermit
like it was yesterday.

245
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,240
Cut it out. That was long in the past.

246
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,250
Oh, you don't know what you're saying!

247
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,290
H-Help me! Goku!

248
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,460
Kuririn! I'm sorry!

249
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,060
You're the same as ever, Goku!

250
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,440
Falling for a simple trick like that!

251
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,400
You got me, huh Kuririn?

252
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,570
This feels great!

253
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,420
<i>Goku really is unaffected.</i>

254
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,840
<i>It's as if nothing at all has</i>
<i>changed from how he was in the past.</i>

255
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,390
<i>I get it!</i>

256
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,640
<i>Goku and Gohan are still training,</i>
<i>even though they're like this!</i>

257
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,820
<i>All right, why don't I test him out?</i>

258
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,110
<i>I'm sure that, even though</i>
<i>it looks like he's asleep,</i>

259
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,410
<i>he's well aware of</i>
<i>everything surrounding him...</i>

260
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:15,370
<i>He'll dodge this stone like it was nothing!</i>

261
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,870
<i>That has to be it!</i>

262
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,920
Ee-yow!

263
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,090
What did you do that for, Kuririn?!

264
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,920
S-S-Sorry...!

265
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,760
Even if I am Super Saiyan,
whatever hurts still hurts, you know!

266
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,470
Huh...?

267
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,020
Yum!

268
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,190
Yum!

269
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,820
Thank you for providing this feast!

270
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,780
Now, Gohan, since you're
through eatin', you've got studyin'.

271
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,530
Right.

272
00:21:56,870 --> 00:22:01,830
<i>Th-This is the training in the</i>
<i>outside world that Goku talked about?</i>

273
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:06,920
Can they really beat Cell by doing this?

274
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,050
I'm full! I'm full!

275
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:20,850
<i>Are you really sure it's</i>
<i>okay to be doing this, Goku?</i>

276
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:24,060
<i>Nine days remain until the</i>
<i>martial arts tournament of terror,</i>

277
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,520
<i>the Cell Games, are held.</i>

278
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,590
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

279
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,380
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

280
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,760
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

281
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,270
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

282
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,780
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

283
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,910
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

284
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

285
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,030
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

286
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:29,540
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

287
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,630
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

288
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,470
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

289
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,470
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

290
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:45,180
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

291
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,310
<i>So sorry.</i>

292
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,480
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

293
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,490
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

294
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,380
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

295
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,380
<i>Gohan sure is taking his time.</i>

296
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,800
<i>He just went out shopping, so what is he up to?</i>

297
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,220
<i>The whole world is in an uproar,</i>
<i>but you really are laid back, Goku.</i>

298
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:26,890
<i>Oh, right, I saw Gohan</i>
<i>talking to a cute girl earlier.</i>

299
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,850
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

300
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:32,310
<i>"A Warrior's Rest...</i>
<i>The Girl, the Lies, and Gohan's Resolution."</i>

301
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:35,940
<i>Father, do you know a man named Tao Pai Pai?</i>

302
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,690
"Next time"
