<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,805 --> 00:00:36,145
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,815 --> 00:00:41,775
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:54,795

23
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:00,355
<i>Majin Boo, having become</i>
<i>the embodiment of evil,</i>

24
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:02,775
<i>had stormed his way into the Heavenly Realm,</i>

25
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:05,905
<i>and destroyed everything on Earth.</i>

26
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,445
<i>According to Piccolo's strategy,</i>

27
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:16,745
<i>he had been led to fight Goten and</i>
<i>Trunks in the Room of Spirit and Time,</i>

28
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:20,085
<i>with the fate of Earth at stake.</i>

29
00:02:39,185 --> 00:02:43,735
<i>The strength of this new</i>
<i>Majin Boo was beyond imagination.</i>

30
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:48,195
<i>Then, finally, Gotenks brought out the</i>
<i>great technique he was keeping in reserve.</i>

31
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:00,495
I went to a lot of trouble
training for this great technique!

32
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,505
<i>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack</i>!!

33
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:36,705
Hi! It's a ghost!

34
00:03:48,085 --> 00:03:49,545
I've won!

35
00:03:52,045 --> 00:03:57,725
<i>"'I've Done It!!'</i>
<i>Boo Successfully Eliminated With Ghosts!?"</i>

36
00:04:07,235 --> 00:04:09,525
I'm scary! I'm scary!

37
00:04:11,775 --> 00:04:14,365
Here goes! I'm ridiculously scary!

38
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:30,505
W-What technique is that?!

39
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:32,085
This is the first time
I've seen anything like that!

40
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:42,265
"Kaboom," he appears! "Kaboom," it's a ghost!

41
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:46,895
This time, even you're dead, Majin Boo!

42
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:51,615
Now, go ahead, ghost!

43
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:56,035
Show him how dreadful the
<i>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack</i> is!

44
00:04:56,075 --> 00:04:58,035
Okay!

45
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,455
Ready, set...!

46
00:05:48,295 --> 00:05:50,415
Yea!! You fool!

47
00:05:50,455 --> 00:05:53,835
If you touch a ghost even the slightest
amount, you'll cause a huge explosion!

48
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:03,645
Yea! Yea! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo!

49
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:07,605
Hurry up and finish him off!
He'll turn back to normal!

50
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,685
I know, I know, already!

51
00:06:09,725 --> 00:06:12,655
I'm going to finish this with one big hard blow!

52
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:19,425
<i>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack</i>!!

53
00:06:20,235 --> 00:06:23,705
I'm going to finish him
with ten ghosts all at once!

54
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:13,665
All right! Fall in!

55
00:07:17,425 --> 00:07:20,795
Ten-hut! Stand at arm's length!

56
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:28,145
You stupid jerk! Be more careful!
Touch me and we'll explode, you know!

57
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:30,765
You shut up! You're just too far forward!

58
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:34,735
See here, you two! Line up, and no more "<i>shigo</i>"!
[<i>shigo</i>: talking]

59
00:07:34,775 --> 00:07:38,315
–What does "<i>shigo</i>" mean?
–That's the place where us ghosts live!

60
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:43,155
–No, that's the world <i>shigo</i>, you know?
–It's a calculation, isn't it? <i>Shi</i> times <i>go</i>, 20!
[<i>shigo</i>: after death; <i>shi</i>: four; <i>go</i>: five]

61
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:47,745
Quiet already, and just line up!
Now, Ten-hut! Count off!

62
00:07:47,785 --> 00:07:53,085
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!!

63
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,505
–All right!
–Hey!

64
00:07:56,545 --> 00:08:00,505
He's long since returned to normal–Majin Boo.

65
00:08:10,145 --> 00:08:12,975
You punk! Make a fool out of me, will you?!

66
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:17,145
You drink your creme
sodas now, while you still can!

67
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:19,695
Yo, yo, Majin Boo!

68
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:21,695
Hmm? You ready now?

69
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,825
Go! Numbers 1 and 2, charge!

70
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:41,135
Fool! I won't fall for the same trick twice! Nyah!

71
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:42,255
Hey, gather around!

72
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:46,345
Did you see that?

73
00:08:46,385 --> 00:08:48,685
That not-too-bright look on his face just now?

74
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:55,025
–Mm-hmm! We saw, we saw!
–Can he really be a Majin looking like that?

75
00:08:55,065 --> 00:08:58,355
He made this face, and went "Nyah" at us!

76
00:09:12,705 --> 00:09:16,205
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, have you noticed it?

77
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:19,455
How Majin Boo's <i>ki</i> has
disappeared in the last little while?

78
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:23,255
N-Now that you mention it...!

79
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:27,095
What does it mean? Is he dead?!

80
00:09:27,135 --> 00:09:32,055
I don't know. I can't feel the
Fusion <i>ki</i> from the little guys either.

81
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:33,765
They ain't seemed to have fought...

82
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:38,025
I wonder why their <i>ki</i> has just up and vanished.

83
00:09:38,065 --> 00:09:43,025
Ah, they're fighting in a world
with a different dimension of time.

84
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:48,945
–What? Time?
–A world with a different
dimension of time. Any ideas about that?

85
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,915
The Room of Spirit and Time!

86
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:54,205
Why are they fighting in that place?

87
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:58,375
Were the half-pints broken-in
on while they were training?

88
00:09:58,415 --> 00:10:02,255
No, the Namekian seems to
have let him inside on purpose.

89
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:06,965
I don't know why, though.

90
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:09,555
How does he know that?

91
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:14,305
Awesome, huh? He's pushing
Gohan's power up and all, too.

92
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:18,935
He's certainly got what you'd
expect of a Kaioshin, ain't he?

93
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:25,105
Hmph! Phooey! I'm not of any use at all here!

94
00:10:30,365 --> 00:10:31,905
Where are you going?

95
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:35,165
I'm sending in some
snacks for them, some snacks!

96
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:36,915
They say you can't fight
on an empty stomach, right?

97
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:39,915
They won't have any
time to eat them, you know.

98
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:43,335
What is it with you?!
How can you all be so calm?

99
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:49,005
Bulma-<i>san</i>, it's okay!
They're Goku and Vegeta's sons!

100
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:53,435
I'm sure those two are
going to save the world for us!

101
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:56,845
So then, Numbers 3 and 4 will...

102
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:09,025
W-What's up with this... battle?
There's no sense of tension!

103
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:11,075
All right, here goes!

104
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,535
Fight-o!!

105
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:16,075
Okay! Let's give it to him!

106
00:11:16,115 --> 00:11:18,535
Serves him right–!

107
00:11:28,085 --> 00:11:30,385
Dammit! Those jackasses!

108
00:11:33,715 --> 00:11:35,095
Those two stupid ghosts are gone,

109
00:11:35,135 --> 00:11:40,975
so everyone but Number 10
go on according to the plan! Go!!

110
00:11:43,105 --> 00:11:43,975
Again?!

111
00:11:51,065 --> 00:11:53,405
Oh! What do you suppose this is?

112
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:54,905
What could it be?

113
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:58,245
–That's strange!
–What's it doing in a place like this?

114
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,245
It's–you know–one of those!

115
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:07,085
–It's poop, isn't it?
–Dummy! Don't say that!

116
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:09,085
This sure is something nice, huh?

117
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,295
–I wonder if it's yummy.
–Good question!

118
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:18,555
Now!!

119
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:28,565
We did it!

120
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:50,585
Yea!!

121
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:56,255
I-It's an incredible fight, but
something about this is absurd!

122
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,195
All right! Number 10, you finish him off!

123
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:16,115
Enter in through Boo's mouth and
blow him away so there's nothing left!

124
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,115
Yes sir!

125
00:13:27,665 --> 00:13:29,125
It's over!

126
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:29,315
I'll turn you into a hot dog! Bam!!

127
00:14:46,365 --> 00:14:48,035
Boo...

128
00:15:58,605 --> 00:15:59,775
Let's go...

129
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:18,335
You know something,
there's nobody around, is there?

130
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:21,335
Where has everybody gone?

131
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:48,115
That was kind of childish, huh?

132
00:16:48,155 --> 00:16:51,535
Me, of all people, giving it
to him like I meant business!

133
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:55,545
There's no time for you to be
breathing easy! Majin Boo will regenerate!

134
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:59,085
You have to burn all the
fragments that have been blown apart!

135
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,005
I'll help too!

136
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:03,005
I know, I know!

137
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:11,845
Geez, and I still had one
more last great technique, too!

138
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:15,015
It's kind of a shame I didn't
get to show off my best stuff.

139
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,985
Be quiet, and hurry it up!

140
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:18,355
Okay, okay...

141
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:40,585
That's the end of it.
That was a bit disappointing, huh?

142
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:44,545
You did well! You really have done well!

143
00:17:44,585 --> 00:17:47,305
To be honest, I didn't think
you could do as much as all this.

144
00:17:58,395 --> 00:18:01,145
W-What is it? This wind...!

145
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:04,605
D-Don't tell me...!

146
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:13,995
H-Hey! The smoke is gathering together!

147
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:19,745
Dammit! It's Majin Boo!

148
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:32,095
Oh? You don't suppose
he's returning to normal?

149
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:40,565
Th-That's it, all right. Say,
now what are we supposed to do?

150
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:43,605
What does it mean, that
even burning him up is no use?

151
00:18:57,455 --> 00:19:01,915
My, my, my... He looks completely pissed off...

152
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,795
Damn, now we've done it!

153
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:05,835
We should have used our
<i>ki</i> to entirely obliterate him,

154
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,505
not just burn him up!

155
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:11,425
A-And then, just in case,
we should have destroyed

156
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:13,515
the entrance to this room,

157
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:16,345
sealing Boo up in this world,
which is in a different dimension.

158
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:18,475
That would have been perfect!

159
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:23,855
Can you do it again?
That Super Ghost Attack you just did?

160
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:27,355
Or for that matter, did you
have another great technique?

161
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:34,035
<i>I do have one more in reserve!</i>
<i>But why don't I get Piccolo-san all anxious?</i>

162
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:36,455
<i>That will make it more exciting, and all...</i>

163
00:19:36,495 --> 00:19:38,285
Well, what about it?

164
00:19:38,325 --> 00:19:40,375
I-It's hopeless!

165
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:44,045
I don't have the kind of power left that
it takes to perform my great technique!

166
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:45,465
It's all over!

167
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:47,585
It's the end of the world!

168
00:20:16,195 --> 00:20:18,405
L-Let me go, you slimeball!

169
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:34,555
Yow! Now I'm pissed off! You bastard!

170
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:40,765
Ding dong, ding dong! Ladies and
gentlemen, thank you for waiting!

171
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:44,605
At long last, I present my
ace-in-the-hole technique!

172
00:20:56,075 --> 00:20:56,945
W-What?

173
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:09,465
P-Piccolo-<i>san</i>, was that...?

174
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:27,475
This is the end for you, Majin Boo!

175
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:32,105
I've destroyed the only
doorway between this world

176
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:36,115
and the one that you and
we had previously been in!

177
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:41,165
You certainly are strong.

178
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:45,495
Unfortunately, not even
Gotenks here could defeat you.

179
00:21:45,535 --> 00:21:48,255
However, no matter how strong you are,

180
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:50,545
it will be impossible for you to
ever leave here for the rest of your life!

181
00:21:55,545 --> 00:21:59,135
P-Piccolo-<i>san</i>, you mean, we...?

182
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,435
So, you can go ahead and kill us,

183
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:06,185
and then spend eternity living here all alone!

184
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:08,685
Here, in this world of nothingness...!

185
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:18,695
<i>Were you too hasty, Piccolo?</i>

186
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:24,865
<i>Will they never be able to</i>
<i>return to their original world again?</i>

187
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:38,795
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

188
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:45,385
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

189
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:55,945
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

190
00:22:55,985 --> 00:23:02,075
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

191
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:09,045
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

192
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:14,415
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

193
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,295
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

194
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:27,395
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

195
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,935
<i>Even now?</i>

196
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:36,565
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

197
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:41,945
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

198
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:48,455
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

199
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:58,465
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

200
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,525
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

201
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:17,945
<i>This ain't good. Using out-of-this-world power,</i>

202
00:24:17,985 --> 00:24:20,695
<i>Boo has come out of the</i>
<i>Room of Spirit and Time alone!</i>

203
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:21,945
<i>Everyone at the temple is in danger!</i>

204
00:24:21,985 --> 00:24:25,245
<i>We have to generate the power to</i>
<i>somehow open a dimensional hole.</i>

205
00:24:25,285 --> 00:24:27,415
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

206
00:24:27,455 --> 00:24:31,245
<i>"Escape From Another Dimension!!</i>
<i>Super Gotenks 3."</i>

207
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:37,085
<i>Way to go! If Gotenks can produce</i>
<i>Super Saiyan 3 power, he can't lose!</i>

208
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,625
"Next time"
"Escape From Another Dimension!!
Super Gotenks 3"
