00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,660
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,290
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,050
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,680
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,930
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,690
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,280
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,200
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,030
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,580
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,580
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,580
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:20,130
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,010
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,600
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,600
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,980
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,190
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,020
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,820
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:46,120
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,580
<i>The instruments of evil, Yamu</i>
<i>and Spopovitch, make their move,</i>

24
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,630
<i>and throw the Tenkaichi</i>
<i>Tournament into great confusion!</i>

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,630
That was easier than I thought!

26
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,360
So, you have come after all.
This will be most helpful.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,570
If I cannot borrow your
powers, we will not likely win...

28
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,780
Not win? You mean against those two?

29
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,830
No. Those two are merely
being used by the Madoshi.

30
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,830
<i>The situation grows more and more tense.</i>

31
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,550
<i>Who is this Madoshi</i>
<i>that Kaioshin is afraid of?</i>

32
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,720
<i>What is he like? And what is to</i>
<i>become of the Tenkaichi Tournament?</i>

33
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:53,890
<i>"The Man Behind the Curtains Appears!!</i>
<i>The Evil Madoshi Babidi."</i>

34
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,290
That went well!

35
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,880
When we bring him this much energy,
Babidi-<i>sama</i> will be most pleased!

36
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,880
We are sure to get a fine reward! Let's hurry!

37
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,340
Yeah!

38
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,710
In other words, in the distant
past, this incredibly terrible monster,

39
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,800
Majin Boo, conjured up by Madoshi Bibidi,

40
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,640
was sealed up somewhere
here on Earth, is that right?

41
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,390
Yes. The only one able to
break that seal was Madoshi Bibidi,

42
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,190
and so we were relieved.

43
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,690
However, as we recently learned,
Madoshi Bibidi had a child.

44
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,280
That child has now come to Earth.

45
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,910
And he's the one who's
manipulating Yamu and Spopovitch?

46
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes. Madoshi Babidi has the same
heart of evil as his father Bibidi.

47
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,830
Majin and Madoshi and such.

48
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,250
Nothing but bizarre guys popping up, huh?

49
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:31,680
So, in short, we have to see to it
that this Majin Boo ain't revived, right?

50
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,310
That is correct. That means
we must defeat Madoshi Babidi.

51
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,310
Babidi is the only one who can
break the seal on Majin Boo now.

52
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,320
So is he strong, this Babidi?

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,660
He uses formidable magic, but he
doesn't have any great power himself.

54
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,240
His father Bibidi was the same way.

55
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,500
However, a Madoshi can
seize upon the hearts of evil men

56
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,630
such as Yamu and Spopovitch,
and manipulate them.

57
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,920
It'd be nice if he didn't keep
such tough people at his side.

58
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,690
So what did Spopovitch and Yamu
come to the Tenkaichi Tournament for?

59
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,700
What is it they did to me?

60
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,120
In order to revive Majin Boo, who has
been sealed up for such a long time,

61
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,700
it seems they need a great
deal of unpolluted energy.

62
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,120
Unpolluted energy?

63
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,500
Babidi sent those two to
the Tenkaichi Tournament,

64
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,340
with the aim of collecting
such energy quickly.

65
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,180
Once you turned Super Saiyan, your
energy became their greatest target.

66
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,010
Both myself and Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>
knew that Babidi would probably do so,

67
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,230
so we slipped in as well.

68
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,650
We wanted to know where Babidi was.

69
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,650
Once we had come to Earth,
we searched around some,

70
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,450
but the ball that Majin Boo had been sealed
in was no longer where it was in the past.

71
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,240
It had been moved somewhere else.

72
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,080
That's why we wanted to follow those two,
so we could learn where Babidi is.

73
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,120
V-Videl-<i>san...</i>

74
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:32,050
You okay?

75
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,500
Y-Yeah...

76
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,550
If this Majin was so terrible,

77
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,270
why did you leave him alone when
you killed Babidi's dad way back then?

78
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,480
It could not be helped.

79
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,440
If we had damaged
him in the wrong place,

80
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,610
we might have
accidentally broken the seal.

81
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,490
Besides, we were at ease.

82
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:00,410
The ball Majin Boo was sealed in
was in a place where mankind on Earth,

83
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:03,450
who had just barely started walking upright,

84
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,370
would find it impossible to go to.

85
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,000
What happened to the matches?!

86
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,170
Start them up now!

87
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,760
Don't you try making fools of us!

88
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,140
Please, wait a moment!
We are currently in conference!

89
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,640
Please wait a moment longer!

90
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,060
What's going on?!

91
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,060
Both Videl and Son Gohan
just took off flying somewhere.

92
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,690
It's been a strange day, huh?

93
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:35,150
Videl got beaten senseless,
then suddenly she's okay again,

94
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,650
and even flying around...

95
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,070
You don't suppose it's all some kind of trick?

96
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,660
The way Mister Satan said before?

97
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,700
I-It has to be. This has got to be a trick!

98
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,540
Never mind Son Gohan, it's unthinkable
that Videl could fly through the air.

99
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,960
Oh, so that's what this is?!

100
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,960
Everyone's joined together
to play a trick on us!

101
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,710
When you take a good
look at it, this is such a waste!

102
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,050
I'm going to give them a piece of
my mind when I see them at school.

103
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,600
Hurry it up! We came to see a match!

104
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,360
Please do not throw things!
Please don't throw things!

105
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,620
Goten, what's going on?

106
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,160
I dunno...

107
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,380
At this speed we will not be
able to catch up to Kaioshin-<i>sama.</i>

108
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,590
We're going to raise our speed a bit more.

109
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,010
R-Right!

110
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,430
Uh, just a second...

111
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,220
Videl-<i>san</i>, I don't think
you should overexert yourself.

112
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,350
I hate it...

113
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,320
...but I can't do any more.

114
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,150
We're already going so fast
I can't keep my eyes open.

115
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,410
Videl-<i>san</i>, you've just
barely started flying is all.

116
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,490
You really should go back.

117
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,540
We don't know what's
going to happen from here on.

118
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,160
It looks like it's going to be
far worse than we can imagine.

119
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,210
I guess that's all I can do.

120
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,040
Any way I think it through,
I'd just be in the way.

121
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,130
Regrettable thought it may be...

122
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,590
Thanks. Go back to
the tournament grounds.

123
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,180
If you find Goten or Mother there,
explain to them what's happening here.

124
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,430
Understood.

125
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,310
But Gohan-<i>kun</i>, you were the
Golden Warrior after all, weren't you?

126
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,610
Y-Yeah. I'm sorry I had to lie to you.
I didn't want anyone to know.

127
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,900
Seven years ago, during the fight with Cell,

128
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,030
those strange people there
at the ring were you guys, huh?

129
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,580
That child who was there together
with them was you, Gohan-<i>kun</i>, right?

130
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,540
Yeah.

131
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,290
And it was probably you
guys that beat Cell, not my Papa.

132
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,500
Well, that is...

133
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,510
I knew it!

134
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,130
It's okay. You don't have to worry over it.

135
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,390
I'd always thought it was a little
strange that Papa defeated him.

136
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,180
It's a load off clearing that up.

137
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:18,560
Hang in there, Gohan-<i>kun</i>. Beat
this Madoshi Babidi and save us all!

138
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,110
Mm-hmm.

139
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,570
Gohan-<i>kun</i>! I'll be waiting for
you at the tournament grounds!

140
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,370
Right!

141
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,580
Is it all right now?

142
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,580
Yes, please excuse us!

143
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,960
Well then, let's raise our speed.
We must catch up to Kaioshin-<i>sama.</i>

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,130
Right!

145
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,340
Wh-What speed they have!

146
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,610
Don't die, Gohan-<i>kun.</i>

147
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:05,400
If you come back safely,
I want to date you and stuff...

148
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,650
Ah, we've caught up!

149
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,490
Father!

150
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,490
Oh, it's Gohan!

151
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,530
Hurry on up here!

152
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,540
Gohan, we've been waiting for you.

153
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,880
Right.

154
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,260
Have you heard?

155
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,010
Our enemy this time seems to
be some incredibly terrible guy!

156
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,430
Yes.

157
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,430
Well, it's been some time.
Should we get rowdy?

158
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,020
I'm sure of it.

159
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,440
Goku is all eager, but are we all right?

160
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
It sounds like it's
going to be pretty bad.

161
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,420
They're here...

162
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,640
There it is.

163
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,610
They've started to descend.

164
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,900
Around here?

165
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,240
Odd. I thought we'd
investigated this area once.

166
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,560
Gentlemen, please hold your <i>ki</i>. Is that clear?

167
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,950
There's someone there.

168
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,780
Is that Babidi?

169
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,660
No, it isn't. He must be
one of Babidi's henchmen.

170
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,750
Say, there's something strange
about the ground, but just in that area.

171
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,960
It's like it's been dug up.

172
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,960
That's it! Babidi must have buried
his spaceship in the ground to hide it.

173
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,380
That's why we searched all
over and still didn't notice it.

174
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:21,560
Which probably means that
Babidi knows we've come to Earth.

175
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,560
Otherwise he wouldn't have
taken the trouble to hide his ship.

176
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,560
Shouldn't we attack now?

177
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,980
Before they can revive Majin Boo
with the energy stolen from Gohan?

178
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,320
It's all right.

179
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,400
Majin Boo's revival should be
conducted outside the spaceship,

180
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,990
in order not to damage it.

181
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,660
Let's watch and wait a little
longer, until that time comes.

182
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,640
Someone's coming out.

183
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,560
Dabura!!

184
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,980
It couldn't be... Dabura?!

185
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:53,270
Babidi has placed the King of the
Demon Realm within the palm of his hand?

186
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:01,240
Dabura? Which one, the big one?

187
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,910
Yes.

188
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,750
Is he pretty awesome?

189
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,950
Of course.

190
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:14,340
He is the King of the Demon
Realm of Darkness, after all.

191
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,760
Wh-What's the Demon Realm of Darkness?

192
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,220
There's another world on
the opposite side of this world.

193
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,770
In this world, one of you
guys is probably Number One,

194
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,310
but Dabura is absolutely Tops
in this other, Demonic world.

195
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,780
King of the Demon Realm, you say?!
Such a world really exists?

196
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,370
This guy must be incredibly
dangerous! All this can't be real!

197
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,290
Which means that little one
must be Madoshi Babidi, right?

198
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,710
Yes.

199
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,290
That guy? That's the guy?

200
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,420
Of his own power, he's certainly helpless,

201
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:01,670
but he uses fearsome magic, so
you must not underestimate him.

202
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,720
It's strong enough that he
made Dabura one of his henchmen.

203
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,140
Then Babidi's magic is strong enough

204
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,730
to make even the kingpin of the
Demon Realm surrender to him?

205
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,900
No. We believe he probably takes a hold of

206
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,650
the evil and greed in his victim's hearts,
and uses it to steer them as he pleases.

207
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,740
In that sense, Dabura is the
most suitable henchman there is.

208
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,740
Truth is, that's the most
horrifying magic Babidi possesses.

209
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:34,330
Yamu, Spopovitch and all his other
henchmen are governed by that magic.

210
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,750
That's why those of us like
yourselves without evil in their hearts

211
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:41,760
are the only ones who
can fight against him.

212
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,130
Those without evil in their hearts, eh?

213
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,260
But doesn't that rule Piccolo out?
He was born a Demon clansman and all...

214
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,510
That was a long time ago!

215
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,690
You have a full tank of energy here?

216
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,690
Y-Yes!

217
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,280
You know, having Dabura
here was a great miscalculation.

218
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,290
To think of having
Babidi and Dabura together...

219
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,750
Are you trying to say our chances
of winning have all but disappeared?

220
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,510
Hmph, if Majin Boo is revived,
it's the end of the world, huh?

221
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:28,720
I won't have it! I won't be beat by them!

222
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,850
Th-This is going to be
pretty dangerous, all right.

223
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,520
Kuririn, you'd better go back.

224
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,900
This is a lot more tough
than we thought it would be.

225
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,110
I-I think I might just do that.

226
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,740
This doesn't appear to be
the level where I can help out.

227
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,660
That and not many days have
passed since you got married and all...

228
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:54,370
Y-Yeah, I've got a wife
and cute little daughter too...

229
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,120
Well, I hate to do so, but...

230
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,840
You've done well.

231
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,680
This brings us considerably
closer to Majin Boo's revival!

232
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,270
Hey, with our powers, it was an
easy job, not even worth mentioning!

233
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,150
Your use to me has now passed.

234
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:20,330
"Boom!" Every time I hear
it, it sounds good, huh?!

235
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,880
Yes. I think so as well.

236
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,210
Well then, I will do him...

237
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,850
Puipui, I bet you'd like a try, right?

238
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,010
Yes!

239
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,660
Nice shot!

240
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,420
Th-They did in their own...
What kind of guys are these?

241
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,720
<i>At last, the ringleader of evil,</i>
<i>Madoshi Babidi shows himself!</i>

242

<i>The King of the Demon Realm</i>

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,950
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

246

247
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:02,220
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

248

<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

249
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:14,610
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

250
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,490
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

251
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:27,540
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

252
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,090

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:36,720

254
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,140
<i>There's some mysterious</i>

255
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:48,600

<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

257
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,090

258
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,930
<i>Kaioshin-sama, if we defeat</i>

259
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,760
<i>who have been turned to stone,</i>

260
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,850
<i>Just a moment! This is a trap!</i>

261
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,770
<i>Once we enter the enemy ship,</i>
