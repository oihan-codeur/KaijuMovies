<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,860
I will now show you the true power of the Saiyans.

17
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:14,680
Indeed, you certainly do have marvelous power.

18
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,720
You have well surpassed me.

19
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,850
However, you cannot beat me like this.

20
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,480
Absolutely not!

21
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,870
Speak hollow boasts to me, will you?

22
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,700
We'll see about that.

23
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,960
<i>"Super Trunks Has a Weakness!!</i>
<i>Cell's Shocking Bombshell Declaration."</i>

24

Dammit!

25
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,690
Going even higher, are you?
It's no use. You cannot beat me.

26
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,710
H-Hey, are you okay, Vegeta?

27
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,130
I have to hurry and give him his senzu.

28
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,550
Over there is good.

29
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,060
H-Hey, Vegeta!

30
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,610
Here's a senzu. Swallow this for me.

31
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,710
Vegeta! Have you come around?

32
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,790
Miserable Cell...!

33
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,870
E-Extraordinary power!

34
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:32,880
He's completely surpassed Cell! U-Unbelievable!

35
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,630
S-Say there, who has?

36
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,090
You guys! Don't talk so muddled,

37
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,680
explain things so I can understand more easily!

38
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,680
Trunks, of course!

39
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,100
Trunks has? Hooray! You're sure strong, huh?

40
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,710
<i>Anger! Anger makes me a Super Saiyan!</i>

41
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,700
When did he get that strong?

42
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,660
This ought to be fun.

43
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,830
Something really incredible might come of it!

44
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,300
<i>Father has been just sitting</i>
<i>there every day lately like that.</i>

45
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,060
<i>I'm sure it must be pretty hard to go</i>
<i>beyond even Super Saiyan, after all.</i>

46
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,510
<i>All right, then...</i>

47
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,690
T-That's an incredible <i>ki</i>!

48
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,700
Father! That's incredible!

49
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,070
You've gone beyond, Father!

50
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,490
You've already gone beyond Super Saiyan!

51
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,330
There's still another stage
of transformation possible.

52
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,860
Y-You did it!

53
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,490
T-This is extraordinary power, Father!

54
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,700
You can't lose to anyone like this!

55
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,700
You can surely beat Cell!

56
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,460
Damn!

57
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,060
I-Impossible! This is impossible!

58
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,520
Why can't I hit him?

59
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,610
I'm disappointed at you, too.

60
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,530
You are no test to the
strength of my perfect form like this.

61
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,860
What?!

62
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,110
D-Dammit!

63
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,290
It's the same, no matter
how many times you do it.

64
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,290
You cannot possibly win against me.

65
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:54,840
<i>Why?! Why, when I'm supposed</i>
<i>to be powered up this much?</i>

66
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,070
Father, you can surely win! For sure!

67
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,700
I can't beat Cell like this... most likely.

68
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,700
H-How come?

69
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:24,450
My form is awesome. So is my power.

70
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,290
But with my muscles bulging out this much,

71
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,710
even though my power has gotten
huge, my speed has been sacrificed.

72
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,050
Great power ain't good for nothing
if you can't hit your opponent, right?

73
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,550
I couldn't beat that monstrous Cell like this.

74
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,270
Besides that, my energy
consumption was too severe.

75
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:50,230
As far as balance goes,
the regular Saiyan size is best.

76
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,610
That much I know for sure.

77
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,190
Gohan...!

78
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,570
Yes?

79
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,570
From now on, except when you're asleep,

80
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,240
stay in your Super Saiyan
form as much as you can.

81
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,870
Come to think of it as your natural state.

82
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,250
We'd better start by eliminating that feeling...

83
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:10,250
...where we have no composure
when we become Super Saiyan.

84
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,800
After that, we start our basic training over.

85
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,260
It may seem like a roundabout
way, but I think it's best.

86
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,720
Right!

87
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,430
All right, I'll do it, Father!

88
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,280
You're such a greenhorn.

89
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,700
For you to say you're
going to show your true power,

90
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:48,750
and then undergo a transformation
that relies on even more power!

91
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,670
That transformation is a simple matter.

92
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,660
However, the transformation
to achieve this sort of power...

93
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,120
...does not give rise to anything!

94
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,340
Nothing at all!

95
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,720
Anyone would know something like that.

96
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,130
Even your father, Vegeta.

97
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,230
You are a fool.

98
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,270
I-Is that right?

99
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:57,480
Dad was able to make this transformation.

100
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,650
He didn't do it anyway.

101
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,690
He knew this is what would happen.

102
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,120
What a fool I've been!

103
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,760
Any chance I had of winning
is completely gone. Kill me.

104
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,550
That I will do.

105
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,850
T-Trunks' <i>ki</i> has gotten extremely small!

106
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:39,900
W-What's wrong?! What's the matter?!

107
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:48,200
C-Cell's <i>ki</i> is still enormous...
Has Trunks been beaten?!

108
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,620
He said he could win, though...

109
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,580
Dammit, that miserable Cell!

110
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,750
Hey, what are you planning to do?

111
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,290
There's only one thing to do–kill Cell!

112
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,880
Y-You...

113
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,550
Shut up!

114
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:13,100
Good grief, those Saiyans are
one outrageous warrior race.

115
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,350
You just can't keep up with them.

116
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:37,290
S-Say, there, has Trunks won yet, I wonder?

117
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:40,250
He's incredible!

118
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,550
Is he all that incredible–Trunks?

119
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,720
No, it's Cell in his perfect form that's incredible.

120
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Trunks is going to be killed!

121
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,640
You've got to be joking!

122
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,140
Look, isn't there anything
you can do? Do something!

123
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:08,700
I have been considerably disappointed,
both by you and your father Vegeta.

124
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,110
I was expecting this to be more enjoyable.

125
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,830
I have one final question.

126
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,710
Never mind that you were decisively beaten by me,

127
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,300
you and Vegeta both upped your powers
dramatically in a short period of time.

128
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,130
Just what was it that you did?

129
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,680
You don't want to talk?

130
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,850
In that case, I'll alter the question for you.

131
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,560
If you had more time, is it possible
you could up yourselves even more?

132
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,860
How about it?

133
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,270
How should I know?

134
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,110
I couldn't tell unless I tried it.

135
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,530
But why would you ask such a thing?

136
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,620
So then, it's not impossible, huh?

137
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,290
Very well, next question.

138
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,290
What is Son Goku doing?
Why hasn't he shown up here?

139
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,750
Goku-<i>san</i> is in the middle
of training to defeat you!

140
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,680
Knowing Goku-<i>san</i>, he will
defeat you, and fulfill our wishes!

141
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,720
I'm convinced of that!

142
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,140
That is a good answer.

143
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:19,430
In that case, I will hold
a martial arts tournament.

144
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,060
Martial arts tournament?

145
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,020
What?! What was that?!

146
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,860
What is it? Don't tell me Trunks has been killed...!

147
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,530
N-No, Cell just said he would
hold a martial arts tournament!

148
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,570
A martial arts tournament?

149
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,040
I'll hold it in ten days, free of charge!

150
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,300
Get as strong as you can
and entertain me, if you would.

151
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,800
W-What the hell are you talking about?

152
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,180
You probably wouldn't know, but in the past,

153
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,640
there was a martial arts tournament,
called the Tenkaichi Tournament.

154
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,560
I'm saying I'm going to hold one again for you!

155
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,440
However, I alone will be your opponent.

156
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,320
The fights will be one-on-one.

157
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,780
If I win, then the next
person will fight me, once again.

158
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,860
Any number of you will be fine!

159
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,080
The more people you have there,

160
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,200
that's just how much the
greater your advantage will be.

161
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,120
Have as many people as
you can get to assemble there.

162
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,920
I'll let you know the location
and other details in a short while,

163
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,210
via a television broadcast or something.

164
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,800
What?!

165
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,720
It seems like a good way to kill some time.

166
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,640
So then, you'd better
prepare a good deal of senzu!

167
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,730
W-Wait, Cell!

168
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,600
What is the purpose of
this martial arts tournament?

169
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,690
And what is your ultimate goal?

170
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,280
I-I don't understand this at all!

171
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,490
Are you out to rule the Earth–no, the universe?

172
00:20:57,530 --> 00:21:00,160
The purpose of the martial arts tournament...

173
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,200
...is to confirm the strength of my perfect form,

174
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,620
as well as to plunge
the whole world into terror.

175
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,130
Besides that, it will serve as an
exercise to further draw out my strength.

176
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,680
I don't particularly have any ultimate goal.

177
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,180
I have no interest in such
base things as conquest.

178
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,100
The original purpose for which
I was created–to kill Son Goku–

179
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,150
does not hold any great
meaning for me as of now.

180
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,700
If I had to say, enjoying
myself is my goal, I suppose.

181
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,070
My biggest aim, of course,

182
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,080
is to see the faces of humans, struck with terror!

183
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,710
Yes, yes! That's the sort of face.

184
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,040
Well, then...

185
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,850
<i>What is this? Cell holding a Tenkaichi Tournament?</i>

186
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,230
<i>Just where do Cell's intentions lie?</i>

187
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:19,360
<i>And can Goku, now in the middle of his</i>
<i>training, obtain the power to defeat Cell?</i>

188
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,980
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

189
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,820
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

190
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,190
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

191
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,700
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

192
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,210
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

193
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,290
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

194
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:18,800
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

195
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,420
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

196
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,930
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

197
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,020
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

198
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,860
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

199
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,860
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

200
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,570
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

201
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,700
<i>So sorry.</i>

202
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,870
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

203
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,880
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

204
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:13,060
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

205
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,020
<i>A Tenkaichi Tournament, huh?</i>

206
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,520
<i>Cell sure did come up with an interesting idea.</i>

207
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,440
<i>We'll have to do our best to train for it!</i>

208
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,320
<i>Hold on a minute! Muten Roshi-sama,</i>
<i>why are you getting worked up?</i>

209
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,240
<i>Don't tell me you're thinking of entering, too!</i>

210
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

211
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,660
<i>"A Final Battle Closes In on Goku!!</i>
<i>The Mystery of the New Tenkaichi Tournament."</i>

212
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,160
<i>I wonder what sort of battle awaits us.</i>

213
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,080
"Next time"
"A Final Battle Closes In on Goku!!
The Mystery of the New Tenkaichi Tournament"
