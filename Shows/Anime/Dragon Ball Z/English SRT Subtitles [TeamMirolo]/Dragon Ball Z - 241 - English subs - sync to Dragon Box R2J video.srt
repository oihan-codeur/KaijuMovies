28
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:42,175
<i>Goku told Piccolo and the others</i>
<i>about a way to oppose Majin Boo.</i>

29
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,565
We'll use Fusion!

30
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:57,105
Fusion! Merging together, right?

31
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,275
It's a unification technique that can be used

32
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:02,945
only if the powers and body
sizes of two people are pretty close.

33
00:03:02,985 --> 00:03:04,945
Unification technique?

34
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:07,995
In other words, by having
two people unite into one,

35
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:10,455
they become a new individual,

36
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:15,165
with awesome powers that neither
one of them could have on their own!

37
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:19,925
Knowing Goten and Trunks,
they might be able to do it!

38
00:03:19,965 --> 00:03:22,335
There's still some hope remaining!

Hey!

Hey, you! Why don't you

00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,345
Everything, you say?

56
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:42,795
Majin Boo! What are you doing?! Let's go!

57
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,955
Still don't feel like I've eaten.

What's this?! Who are you?!

59
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:37,175
Okay! That should be about enough, right?!

60
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,725
Let's go!

61
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:41,435
Still don't feel like I've eaten.

62
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:46,855
Ah, wait a minute! Majin Boo!

63
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:57,115
W-What are you doing?!
Let me go! How ill-mannered of you!

64
00:07:57,155 --> 00:08:00,115
You're the ill-mannered
one here, aren't you Uncle?

65
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:02,125
Uncle?!

66
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,035
Please pay for those cakes!

67
00:08:04,075 --> 00:08:06,415
Include the cost for repairs
to the door, the show window,

68
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:09,715
and everything else, if you please!

69
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,085
I won't let you go until then.

70
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:16,265
Sweetheart, you don't
seem to know who I am.

71
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:18,095
Not in the least!

72
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:23,105
You'll learn whether you want to or
not soon enough, but I'll tell you anyway.

73
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:26,275
Whether or not this world
continues on its way to destruction

74
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:29,735
is entirely up to my will!

75
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,275
I am Madoshi Babidi-<i>sama</i>!

76
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:41,325
I don't care if you're a Madoshi or a
Keiyoshi, you'll have to pay your bill!

77
00:08:41,365 --> 00:08:44,995
How rude of you! Papparapa!

78
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,625
She vanished!

79
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,045
Would you like to try vanishing too?!

80
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:58,675
Help me!

81
00:08:59,845 --> 00:09:06,105
Attention criminals! Cease your
futile resistance and come out quietly!

82
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,275
Majin Boo! Haven't you had enough yet?!

83
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:15,275
No good. This cake is yummy,
but doesn't make my tummy full.

84
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:18,155
Majin Boo! Right now!

85
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,575
Do you want to be sealed up again?!

86
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:31,715
Don't move!

87
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:36,465
You're under arrest for destruction of
property and failure to pay your check!

88
00:09:51,225 --> 00:09:52,275
Dammit!

89
00:10:14,705 --> 00:10:17,045
Still don't feel like I've eaten.

90
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:19,675
Don't get so mad.

91
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:25,475
Come on, let's go agonize that
green guy and those two runts now!

92
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:33,225
I'll teach them! I'll show
them quite a scene real soon!

93
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,495
K-Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

94
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:38,125
K-Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>! Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

95
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,005
Thank goodness! There's still time!

96
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:07,735
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

97
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:10,705
K-Kibit!

98
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:15,705
What is this? Were you not killed by Dabura?

99
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,145
Is that so? What an odd occurrence.

100
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:38,355
Yes. It's surprising that the
power to return one from death

101
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:41,395
would be found on this planet.

102
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:44,695
That's right!

103
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:50,075
Kibit, please hurry! Gohan-<i>san</i> is also in peril!

104
00:12:50,115 --> 00:12:53,705
We absolutely must not allow Gohan-<i>san</i> to die!

105
00:12:53,745 --> 00:12:54,825
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

106
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:03,045
Majin Boo! How about getting
back into a good mood already?

107
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:04,715
I'm hungry!

108
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:16,055
Kibit, can you feel it?
Majin Boo's enormous power energy?

109
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,685
Yes, of course!

110
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:21,525
Quite honestly, I am filled with despair.

111
00:13:21,565 --> 00:13:28,075
There can no longer be any days of rest
for any living thing throughout the universe.

112
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:33,115
The situation that we most
feared has become a reality.

113
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:40,125
It's not necessarily hopeless.
I have come to see a faint light.

114
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:45,085
Don't tell me this is
somehow related to Son Gohan!

115
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,045
That's right.

116
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:51,425
His power, already beyond imagination,
can become something even more fantastic,

117
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:54,435
perhaps even surpassing Majin Boo!

118
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:57,435
What's that?! Impossible, how can that be?

119
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:01,065
You did not see how
incredible those three Saiyans are,

120
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:03,435
so you probably cannot imagine it.

121
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,615
We must find him quickly!

122
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:11,735
Gohan-<i>san</i>'s <i>ki</i> is very weak,
but I feel it coming from those trees.

123
00:14:22,545 --> 00:14:24,665
He should be around here somewhere.

124
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:26,755
There he is! Over there!

125
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:44,315
He's alive! But he's in as much
jeopardy as you were, Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

126
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:46,355
Thank goodness!

127
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:54,655
Kibit, let us perform
Gohan-<i>san</i>'s power restoration...

128
00:14:54,695 --> 00:14:59,035
...after we arrive in the Kaioshin Realm.

129
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:03,045
D-Don't tell me you intend to allow a human

130
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,665
to set foot inside the Kaioshin Realm!

131
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:10,005
That holy region into which not
even the Grand Kaio has set foot?

132
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:14,465
That is correct. Come, let us hurry!

133
00:15:14,505 --> 00:15:16,385
–Right.
–Kai-Kai!

134
00:15:27,065 --> 00:15:30,485
What's up with Bulma's father and mother?

135
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,695
They couldn't stand to leave their pets behind.

136
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:37,865
They said if they do get killed we can just
bring them back to life with the Dragon Balls.

137
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:40,535
That's just like your parents, huh Bulma?

138
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:42,085
I guess so.

139
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,705
If only we knew where
Tenshinhan and them are,

140
00:15:44,745 --> 00:15:47,545
we could let them
take shelter here too.

141
00:15:47,585 --> 00:15:52,385
More importantly,
where are Gohan and Goten?

142
00:15:52,425 --> 00:15:54,795
And Trunks and Vegeta?

143
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:08,985
So, where are they at?

144
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,965
Goku?

145
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:39,765
I'll say it, since it's
something that has to be said.

146
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:49,435
Goten and Trunks are fine...
but Gohan and Vegeta are dead.

147
00:17:00,445 --> 00:17:03,325
They've been killed by Majin Boo.

148
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:08,795
G-Gohan-<i>kun</i>... It can't be!

149
00:17:10,505 --> 00:17:12,835
Gohan...

150
00:17:14,505 --> 00:17:15,965
Ch-Chichi!

151
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:21,515
V-Vegeta...

152
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:25,435
No!!

153
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:28,975
Bulma! Get a hold of yourself! Bulma!

154
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,605
Chichi!

155
00:17:39,485 --> 00:17:40,905
Chichi!

156
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:47,035
I-I won't have...

157
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:49,165
...such a thing...!

158
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:02,805
Goku, things have gotten awful, huh?

159
00:18:02,845 --> 00:18:04,345
Karin-<i>sama...</i>

160
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:07,725
I couldn't just sit still, you know?

161
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,855
This is an enemy even
greater than Freeza or Cell

162
00:18:10,895 --> 00:18:12,985
you've fought up to now, Goku.

163
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,525
An evil one has now indeed appeared.

164
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,875
I'm hungry.

165
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:31,875
There's no helping you!

166
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:36,965
I know! I just had a good idea!
This should cheer you up.

167
00:18:38,465 --> 00:18:41,555
Goku, let's hurry and teach them Fusion.

168
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:45,845
That's right. Popo,
where are Trunks and Goten?

169
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:52,355
Can you hear me, people of Earth?

170
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:56,905
I am the Madoshi Babidi!

171
00:18:56,945 --> 00:19:00,735
Oh, don't look for me, you won't find me!

172
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:05,865
I'm speaking to your minds through magic.

173
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:10,785
Sorry to interrupt while
you're living peacefully.

174
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:14,795
The thing is, I had a rather
disagreeable thing happen to me today,

175
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:18,425
at the hands of a certain trio of fools.

176
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:21,795
I'm looking for those fools now.

177
00:19:21,835 --> 00:19:23,385
What is this?

178
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:26,935
–Are you hearing this too?
–Yeah. What's going on?

179
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:34,395
Close your eyes and watch,
I'm about to project their images.

180
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:36,275
What's he doing?!

181
00:19:39,815 --> 00:19:46,195
Can you see them now?
I'm looking for these three.

182
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:57,795
Come on out! You must
know who you are yourselves!

183
00:19:57,835 --> 00:20:00,965
If you don't come out...

184
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:04,965
I know, why don't we introduce ourselves?

185
00:20:05,005 --> 00:20:09,135
I am the terrifying Madoshi Babidi-<i>sama</i>!

186
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:14,265
And this is my servant, the
even more frightening Majin Boo!

187
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:15,935
He's a strong one!

188
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:21,315
There is utterly no one
around who can beat him!

189
00:20:21,355 --> 00:20:23,275
Can you see this city?

190
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:26,155
If those three fools do not come forward,

191
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:30,325
let me show you just a
little of what will happen.

192
00:20:30,365 --> 00:20:32,995
S-Stop!

193
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:35,875
I don't much care for things to get all messy,

194
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:40,835
so I will kill everyone in
this city in a smartly manner!

195
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,005
Okay, begin, Majin Boo!

196
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:58,355
Help!

197
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:02,855
Th-That scum! What is he planning to do?!

198
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:12,325
What should I make you?
I've had enough cake, so... okay!

199
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:15,415
You turn into hard candy!

200
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:54,495
All the people on this
planet will end up like this!

201
00:22:05,005 --> 00:22:11,925
<i>Babidi's terrible plans to call out</i>
<i>Piccolo and the others have finally begun.</i>

202
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:16,765
<i>Will everyone be devoured up by Majin Boo</i>

203
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:22,145
<i>before Piccolo, Trunks</i>
<i>and Goten show themselves?</i>

204
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:38,865
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

205
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:45,455
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

206
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:56,015
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

207
00:22:56,055 --> 00:23:02,145
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

208
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:09,155
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

209
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:14,535
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

210
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:18,365
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

211
00:23:18,405 --> 00:23:27,465
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

212
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,005
<i>Even now?</i>

213
00:23:29,045 --> 00:23:36,635
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

214
00:23:36,675 --> 00:23:42,015
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

215
00:23:42,055 --> 00:23:48,525
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

216
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:58,535
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

217
00:24:13,675 --> 00:24:15,765
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

218
00:24:15,805 --> 00:24:19,975
<i>Whew, Gohan, good for you,</i>
<i>getting saved from danger like that.</i>

219
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:23,815
<i>Gohan-san, using this legendary</i>
<i>sword of the Kaioshin Realm,</i>

220
00:24:23,855 --> 00:24:26,275
<i>I want you to defeat Majin Boo.</i>

221
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:28,485
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

222
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:32,155
<i>"Gohan Revived –</i>
<i>Kaioshin's Secret Weapon!?"</i>

223
00:24:32,195 --> 00:24:36,195
<i>Legendary sword?</i>
<i>I wonder if it's incredibly sharp.</i>

224
00:24:36,235 --> 00:24:37,905
"Next time"
"Gohan Revived–Kaioshin's Secret Weapon!?"
<i>It's a little bit scary.</i>
