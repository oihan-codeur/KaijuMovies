<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

2
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,780
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,560
<i>After successfully stealing all five</i>
<i>Dragon Balls from Freeza's spaceship,</i>

17
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,930
<i>Vegeta showed up in front of Kuririn and Bulma,</i>

18
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:26,460
<i>who had the last remaining Dragon Ball.</i>

19
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,070
<i>However, just then, Zarbon, who</i>
<i>was under orders from Freeza, appeared.</i>

20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,110
<i>Elsewhere, Son Goku, who</i>
<i>was speeding to Planet Namek,</i>

21
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,280
<i>was caught in a sudden magnetic storm,</i>

22
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,620
<i>and had fallen into a life-or-death</i>
<i>crisis, due to unstable controls,</i>

23
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,500
<i>which had suddenly subjected</i>
<i>him to 100-times gravity.</i>

24
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,100
<i>"I'm Back to My Old Self Again!!</i>
<i>Goku Under 100-Times Super-Gravity."</i>

25
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,880
G-Goku!

26
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,620
No matter how strong Goku<i>-san</i> may be,

27
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,860
if it takes an hour to get through
that magnetic storm, he won't last!

28
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,460
Can't you do something?

29
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,770
I'm completely like this.

30
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,430
Huh?

31
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,110
I give up.

32
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,120
<i>I-I'll cut the chain!</i>

33
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,960
<i>Kamehame-Ha!!</i>

34
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,300
Go, <i>Kamehame-Ha</i>!

35
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,540
T-This is the worst!

36
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,550
How is this the worst?

37
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,750
He's a pretty nice-looking man, isn't he?

38
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,520
P-Please don't go judging people
by their faces at a time like this!

39
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,890
But usually, the handsome
guy fights for justice.

40
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,560
This isn't Earth, it's Planet Namek.

41
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,560
Yeah, I understand that.

42
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,940
Bulma<i>-san</i>, you don't understand anything.

43
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:36,620
You've managed to mock me
pretty good, haven't you, Vegeta<i>-san</i>?

44
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,580
I see.

45
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,290
I recall seeing that runt over
there holding the Dragon Ball before.

46
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,800
You guys have joined forces, have you?

47
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
Yoo-hoo!

48
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,870
Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo! Beat up Vegeta!

49
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,540
I don't care about them.

50
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,810
None of that matters.

51
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,540
Vegeta, where have you
hidden the remaining Dragon Balls?

52
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,550
You're going to stand before Freeza and tell us.

53
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,580
Try and make me.

54
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,550
You'll never learn.

55
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,890
Come on, why don't you transform, already?

56
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,220
What?!

57
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,730
Zarbon, until you change
into that hideous form of yours,

58
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,500
you can't fight toe-to-toe with me.

59
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,830
To someone like myself, who prefers beauty,

60
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:31,170
those words are the greatest insult!

61
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,910
Vegeta, you have gotten me genuinely angry.

62
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,240
But you can relax.

63
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,910
Freeza ordered me to bring you back alive.

64
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,750
You're too soft, Zarbon.

65
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,620
That softness is what
has restored me back to life.

66
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,630
Shut up!

67
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,870
How handsome!

68
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,570
Bulma<i>-san...</i>

69
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,890
Bulma<i>-san</i>, now's our chance!
Let's get out of here!

70
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,560
But he said he'd kill us if we ran!

71
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,090
He'll kill us even if we <i>don't</i> run!

72
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,600
I won't let you do that!

73
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,410
Damn! He doesn't miss a single thing!

74
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,270
Don't you sell me short!

75
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,870
You are prepared to answer for this, yes?

76
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:15,250
If you are unable to bring
Vegeta back here in one hour...

77
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,220
<i>If this keeps up...</i>

78
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,890
You've finally made up your mind, have you?

79
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,890
H-He's a villain, all right!

80
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,900
W-What was that?! He turned into a monster!

81
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,500
What's more, his power shot up like mad!

82
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,600
Vegeta, you're the only one
who has seen this form twice!

83
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:26,580
I wonder why it was at
the bottom of that lake.

84
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,920
I know! The villagers might
have been in a rush to hide it.

85
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,580
There are two incredible <i>ki</i>!

86
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,490
They're coming from
where Bulma<i>-san</i> is waiting!

87
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,170
Whichever one of them
wins, it's bad news for us.

88
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,180
S-Son<i>-kun</i>, hurry and get here!

89
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,750
What are you doing, Goku?! Stop that!

90
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,990
I ain't about... to die here!

91
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,530
Goku, it's no use! You can't cut that chain!

92
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,530
G-Goku!

93
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,330
Goku<i>-san</i>!

94
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,690
It's designed so that it
won't break when you do that!

95
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,940
<i>Kaio-ken!!</i>

96
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,650
He did it! He did it!
What a guy! That was amazing!

97
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:39,100
Damn... that's 100-times gravity for you...

98
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,810
The bones throughout my
body are broken to pieces...

99
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,910
Goku! Goku!

100
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,240
Goku-san! Goku-san!

101
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,950
<i>I know... I can't die here...</i>

102
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,620
<i>I've got bones broken all over...</i>

103
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,800
<i>Vegeta, just you wait!</i>

104
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,220
Goku<i>-san</i>!

105
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:05,890
Goku!

106
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,420
Goku! Don't worry about
your face! Hang in there!

107
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,590
He did it! He did it! He did it!

108
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,750
Whew, that was a close one.

109
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,260
A little bit more, and
I would have been dead.

110
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,930
But still, I did it.

111
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,600
I experienced 100-times gravity.

112
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,470
At this point, I can go
right to training at 100-times.

113
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,600
<i>You fell for it, Zarbon.</i>

114
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,630
Dammit!

115
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,160
You planned that!

116
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,500
Vegeta! How dare you!

117
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,540
Looks like that hurt pretty bad.

118
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,540
Your strength has dropped
quite a bit, hasn't it?

119
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,880
Zarbon<i>-san</i>, it appears your death is near.

120
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,750
My death is near?!

121
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,380
Don't make me laugh!

122
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,880
My battle power is higher than yours!

123
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:19,090
Zarbon<i>-san</i>, aren't you supposed
to be well informed about Saiyans?

124
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,230
Carelessly treating me after
I was near death was a bad idea, huh?

125
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,760
Isn't that right?

126
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,580
<i>It's a good thing I brought these senzu...</i>

127
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,790
<i>I'll have to thank Yajirobe...</i>

128
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,920
Yahoo!

129
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,100
Ups-a-daisy!

130
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,270
All right, I'm back to my old self!
Now for some 100-times training–

131
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,940
Before I do, maybe
I'll go have something to eat.

132
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,190
Saiyans are able to increase
their battle power dramatically...

133
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,890
...every time we recover
from the brink of death!

134
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,690
So that's it.

135
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:06,530
Now that he mentions it, Goku got
stronger every time he had a fierce battle.

136
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:10,540
Damn, so that's the reason why
Vegeta's <i>ki</i> has risen like crazy, huh?

137
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,870
Listen, even if your battle power has risen,

138
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,370
there's still no way you can
beat me after I've transformed,

139
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,080
and can exhibit my true power!

140
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:27,220
The Saiyans are a fighting race!
Don't underestimate us!

141
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:02,250
V-Vegeta... I was only acting
under orders from Freeza<i>-sama...</i>

142
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,190
Let me go... please...

143
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,760
After as much as you've worked me to the bone,

144
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,530
don't you dare go asking
for anything for yourself!

145
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,200
I know... The two of us
could team up... If we did...

146
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,970
...we could even beat Freeza...

147
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,950
If I could defeat Freeza
just by teaming up with you,

148
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,560
it wouldn't be very sporting.

149
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,000
Now then...

150
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,960
I don't know how you did it,

151
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
but you've raised your battle power
a bit since we were on Earth, haven't you?

152
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,880
But you're still not at the level where
you can fight me on even terms, are you?

153
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,880
What will it be? Would you be inclined
to hand over that Dragon Ball to me nicely?

154
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,880
I-I doubt it will do any good
to make any agreements with you,

155
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,220
but if I hand this over, do you
promise to leave here without any trouble?

156
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,220
A promise, huh? Well, all right.

157
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,260
As long as I have the Dragon Ball,

158
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,560
there's no sense in playing
around with you, small fry.

159
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,570
Y-You mean it?

160
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,940
What a pest. If that's
how badly you want to live,

161
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,810
then hand it over before I change my mind.

162
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,610
K-Kuririn...

163
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,780
You guys are lucky.

164
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,920
I'm in a good mood, since I have
now found all of the Dragon Balls.

165
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,860
Now I can attain eternal life,

166
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,670
which will allow me to rule the
entire universe, instead of Freeza!

167
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,970
<i>W-We're not about to let</i>
<i>Vegeta get all seven of them!</i>

168
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,980
<i>C-Come on, Gohan!</i>

169
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:18,290
<i>At length, six of the Dragon Balls</i>
<i>had fallen into Vegeta's hands.</i>

170
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,960
<i>All that remained was the</i>
<i>Si Xing Qiu Ball being held by Gohan.</i>

171
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,840
<i>Will Gohan be able to protect it?</i>

172
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

173
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,490
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

174
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,870
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

175
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,370
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

176
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,880
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

177
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,950
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

178
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

179
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,120
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

180
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

182
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,530
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

183
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

184
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,240
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

185
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,410
<i>So sorry.</i>

186
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,520
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

187
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,530
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

188
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,940
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

189
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,410
<i>I've finally gotten all of the Dragon Balls!</i>

190
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:21,050
<i>The whole universe is now mine!</i>

191
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,250
<i>W-What is this?</i>

192
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:26,580
<i>There are five enormous</i>
<i>powers headed for Planet Namek!</i>

193
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,550
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

194
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:32,560
<i>"Freeza's Secret Weapon!</i>
<i>The Devilish Ginyu Special Corps."</i>

195
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,930
<i>I'll never hand over the Dragon Ball!</i>

196
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:38,270
"Next time"
"Freeza's Secret Weapon!
The Devilish Ginyu Special Corps"
