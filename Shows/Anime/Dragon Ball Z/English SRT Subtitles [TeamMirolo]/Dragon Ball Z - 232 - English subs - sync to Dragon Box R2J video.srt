00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,845
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:30,435
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,845 --> 00:00:36,185
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:41,815
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:49,075
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:54,835
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:57,415
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:00,335
<i>The sky is clear</i>

00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:03,175
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:05,765
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:08,765
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,805 --> 00:01:11,765
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,435
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:20,275
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:23,155
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:25,785
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:28,785
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,825 --> 00:01:31,115
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:34,335
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:37,165
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:39,965
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:46,255
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:08,785
Vegeta, with your great pride, you
allowed yourself to be controlled by that guy

24
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:11,495
just because you wanted to become stronger?!

25
00:02:13,495 --> 00:02:14,995
I...

26
00:02:16,075 --> 00:02:21,335
I wanted to return to the way I was long ago!

27
00:02:22,085 --> 00:02:24,505
I wanted to return to the brutal,
cold-blooded Saiyan that I was,

28
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:30,005
so I could fight all-out with
you and not worry about anything!

29
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:35,515
<i>Vegeta, having returned</i>
<i>to being a wicked warrior,</i>

30
00:02:35,555 --> 00:02:39,015
<i>continues a ferocious battle with Son Goku.</i>

31
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:54,905
<i>And so, as Majin Boo's ball</i>
<i>received the inflicted damage energy...</i>

32
00:03:08,085 --> 00:03:13,055
He's at full power! Majin Boo is at full power!!

33
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:16,685
<i>The seal was at last broken.</i>

34
00:03:16,725 --> 00:03:21,975
<i>Will the terrifying monster,</i>
<i>Majin Boo, finally reveal himself?</i>

35
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:31,065
<i>"I Won't Allow the Revival!!</i>
<i>A Kamehame-Ha of Resistance."</i>

36
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:55,115
Dabura, he's emerging now!
Majin Boo is emerging!

37
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:56,785
Y-Yes!

38
00:04:56,825 --> 00:04:59,155
The seal has finally been broken!

39
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:02,285
We will finally be able to see Majin Boo!

40
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,035
So, come on out!

41
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:09,295
What sort of incredible guy is
Majin Boo, who my papa created?!

42
00:05:09,335 --> 00:05:12,135
We are indeed certainly looking
forward to this, Babidi-<i>sama</i>!

43
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:16,135
I've been eagerly awaiting
this day! Hurry and come on out!

44
00:05:27,355 --> 00:05:30,565
<i>F-Father's damage energy–</i>

45
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:34,445
<i>Having gone beyond Super</i>
<i>Saiyan, Father's damage energy...</i>

46
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:40,325
<i>Who could have thought it would</i>
<i>have revived Majin Boo so quickly?</i>

47
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:44,205
It's no longer any use!
Let's run away, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

48
00:05:46,205 --> 00:05:49,295
Let's run away, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

49
00:05:50,255 --> 00:05:52,885
If we do such a thing, then what?

50
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:55,345
Is it okay for us to leave it here like this?

51
00:05:55,385 --> 00:05:58,095
If we do that, Majin Boo will be revived!

52
00:05:58,135 --> 00:06:01,765
There is no way we can win
against Majin Boo, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

53
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:04,225
No matter how strong you
guys may be, it's impossible!

54
00:06:04,265 --> 00:06:08,225
The person who can defeat
Majin Boo does not exist in this world!

55
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:11,985
If we stay here, make no
mistake, we will be killed!

56
00:06:14,105 --> 00:06:16,235
But Kaioshin-<i>sama...</i>

57
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:19,785
Hurry, Gohan-<i>san</i>! Let's run away!

58
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:21,245
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

59
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:23,155
Hurry!!

60
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:28,995
As long as he's already at
full power, I can at least...

61
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:51,265
Gohan-<i>san</i>, what are you...?

62
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:04,615
W-What is he planning to do?

63
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,035
A good question.

64
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:09,205
I'll do this much to him!

65
00:07:57,665 --> 00:07:59,005
Gohan-<i>san...</i>

66
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:17,195
Trunks-<i>kun</i>! Stop! Stop!

67
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:19,025
What is it, Goten?

68
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,695
Something's been strange for a while now.

69
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:24,655
There's a big <i>ki</i> in that direction, too!

70
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:29,575
Yeah, I know. A weird kind
of <i>ki</i> like I've never felt before.

71
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:32,035
It's pretty big.

72
00:08:32,075 --> 00:08:37,255
Both this way and that way–Aah, this
is getting more and more complicated!

73
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,395
B-Birds!

74
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,555
There's so many of them.
What could be the matter?

75
00:08:52,595 --> 00:08:55,065
What in the world is happening?

76
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:57,395
Do you think it has anything
to do with Majin Boo?

77
00:08:57,435 --> 00:08:58,275
Who knows?

78
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,635
W-What is it? What's wrong?

79
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:25,255
Good question.

80
00:09:28,805 --> 00:09:33,055
Mister Satan, please call
on everyone to calm down!

81
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:34,645
But...

82
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:38,275
At this rate, it will become a panic,

83
00:09:38,315 --> 00:09:39,605
and we won't be able to conclude!

84
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,655
We still have not handed over the prize
money for your victory, Mister Satan!

85
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,615
Prize money!

86
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:50,785
That's right! I haven't gotten
my prize money yet, have I?

87
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:53,325
Quickly, award me my prize money!

88
00:09:53,365 --> 00:09:56,415
That's impossible, under these circumstances!

89
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,505
People! Do not panic!

90
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:01,585
I, Mister Satan, am always
here together with you, am I not?!

91
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,505
Even in the event that the
end of the world is approaching,

92
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:08,465
as long as I, Mister Satan, am here,
I will protect you, no matter what!

93
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:12,015
Oh, it's Mister Satan!

94
00:10:12,055 --> 00:10:16,435
That's right, we still have Mister Satan!

95
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,975
Mister Satan, we're counting on you!

96
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:28,445
Satan! Satan! Satan!

97
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:42,505
I nailed it! I nailed that so cool!
Let's get my money quick and go home!

98
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:48,635
Mm, something is happening.

99
00:10:48,675 --> 00:10:53,385
Something more frightfully
terrible than anything else up to now...

100
00:10:53,425 --> 00:10:57,355
I-It can't be! Goten-<i>chan</i>'s
run off somewhere now,

101
00:10:57,395 --> 00:11:01,065
and just when I'm thinkin'
Gohan and Goku-<i>sa</i> have appeared,

102
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,525
they go vanishin' again.
What am I supposed to do?

103
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:51,405
Why, that lousy– Babidi-<i>sama</i>!
I will go and make him heed us!

104
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:58,155
I-It's all right! Majin Boo won't
even blink over something like this!

105
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,425
Y-You fool! Doing such a thing is worthless!

106
00:12:25,105 --> 00:12:26,685
All right!

107
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:11,445
Out he comes! Majin Boo!

108
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:12,605
Babidi-<i>sama</i>!

109
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:30,835
It's empty!

110
00:13:41,015 --> 00:13:45,315
N-No! This wasn't supposed to be! It can't be!

111
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:50,025
Why is this? Why is this so?

112
00:13:57,025 --> 00:13:59,825
Come on out! Come on out, I say!

113
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:03,325
Majin Boo! Please, come out!

114
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:11,455
What good fortune!

115
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,545
Tough luck, Babidi!

116
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:22,845
Majin Boo was exterminated
by that attack just now!

117
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:27,065
It's probable he shriveled
up over his long sleep,

118
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:29,105
and no matter how much
energy you poured into him,

119
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:33,905
he would not be as tough as he was in the past!

120
00:14:33,945 --> 00:14:36,405
And now, the Earth will be saved!

121
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:42,905
It is well, is it not, Babidi-<i>sama</i>?

122
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:46,535
Even if we do not have Majin Boo, I am here.

123
00:14:46,575 --> 00:14:49,205
On top of that, there is that guy Vegeta,

124
00:14:49,245 --> 00:14:52,255
who even though incompletely,
is still under your control.

125
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:57,885
B-But... Majin Boo!
My papa's creation, Majin Boo!

126
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:01,005
Babidi, at this stage, are
you reduced to whining?

127
00:15:04,345 --> 00:15:09,935
Dabura, having come to this, let's at
least deal with that insolent Kaioshin!

128
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,065
Right!

129
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:18,275
I will somehow or other pin Babidi down.

130
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:22,575
Gohan-<i>san</i>, if you will then defeat Dabura,

131
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:25,075
Babidi's ambitious
schemes will utterly evaporate!

132
00:15:26,495 --> 00:15:30,455
And so, as you were told by Goku-<i>san,</i>
now is just the time for you to become angry!

133
00:15:30,495 --> 00:15:35,925
Become angry, and
show your true power for me!

134
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:40,925
Gohan-<i>san</i>, peace has nearly come upon us!

135
00:15:40,965 --> 00:15:44,215
Th-Th-That's not true!

136
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:52,315
A terrible <i>ki</i>... a terrible
<i>ki</i> is swelling up! I-It's...

137
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:01,275
W-What is it you're saying, Gohan-<i>san</i>?

138
00:16:01,315 --> 00:16:05,245
The smoke! The smoke that
came out of where that ball is!

139
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:16,335
What? What is he looking at?

140
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:23,755
That cloud! No, the smoke
from before is gathering!

141
00:16:25,925 --> 00:16:27,345
Y-You don't mean...!

142
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:21,445
–Not bad, Vegeta!
–I'll show you what I do best!

143
00:18:09,445 --> 00:18:11,325
What a terrible <i>ki</i>!

144
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:19,415
Hey, up there!

145
00:18:19,455 --> 00:18:21,295
C-Can it be...?

146
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:56,165
Babidi-<i>sama</i>, is that Majin Boo?

147
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:57,785
N-Not sure.

148
00:18:57,825 --> 00:18:59,665
I've never seen him before.

149
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:05,425
The only one who has ever
seen Majin Boo is Kaioshin there.

150
00:19:11,425 --> 00:19:15,225
Er, is that Majin Boo?

151
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:22,815
Th-That's right! I would never
forget th-that terrifying face!

152
00:19:22,855 --> 00:19:27,275
Oh, that seems to
be Majin Boo, after all!

153
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,195
A-A guy such as this...?!

154
00:19:35,245 --> 00:19:38,035
Hey there, Majin Boo!

155
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:42,835
He's called a Majin, so I figured he'd be bigger.

156
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:46,835
It's no use any more! We can't escape!

157
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,505
Are you sure about that?

158
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:53,175
While he certainly does
possess an extraordinary <i>ki,</i>

159
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:56,185
it doesn't appear to be so much
that we can do nothing about it.

160
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:59,605
I-Is that true, Gohan-<i>san</i>?!

161
00:19:59,645 --> 00:20:03,315
Yes! If I can just put forward all of my force...

162
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:56,115
Majin Boo!

163
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,625
Majin Boo!

164
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,765
Damn you!

165
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:21,765
Wait, Vegeta! Wait!

166
00:21:21,805 --> 00:21:26,605
A <i>ki</i>! A fairly enormous <i>ki</i> has appeared!

167
00:21:26,645 --> 00:21:30,565
Majin Boo has emerged after all!

168
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:18,195
At last, Majin Boo is revived.

169
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:26,245
However, is he really strong
enough to plunge the Earth into crisis?

170
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:39,135
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

171
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:45,725
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

172
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:56,275
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

173
00:22:56,315 --> 00:23:02,365
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

174
00:23:02,405 --> 00:23:09,375
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

175
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:14,755
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

176
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:18,635
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

177
00:23:18,675 --> 00:23:27,725
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

178
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,225
<i>Even now?</i>

179
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:36,905
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

180
00:23:36,945 --> 00:23:42,285
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

181
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:48,745
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

182
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:58,795
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

183
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:16,395
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

184
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:21,775
<i>Look, Gohan, Majin Boo ain't</i>
<i>an opponent that we can handle.</i>

185
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:27,455
<i>It's too late! The two of</i>
<i>us will not likely return alive.</i>

186
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:29,745
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

187
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:33,375
<i>"A Straight Line to Despair!?</i>
<i>The Grief of Kaioshin."</i>

188
00:24:33,415 --> 00:24:37,795
<i>Oh, no... To think that I can't even get away!</i>

189
00:24:37,835 --> 00:24:39,925
"Next time"
"A Straight Line to Despair!?
The Grief of Kaioshin"
