Don't talk such foolishness, Gohan!

00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:04,265
It's not like a Saiyan to give up, Gohan!

20
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:08,185
Father! W-Where are you?

21
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,395
The Next World.

22
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:14,355
B-But right now, I can only use one arm,

23
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:17,275
and I've got less than half of my <i>ki</i> left...

24
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:22,115
That's all right, you can win!

25
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:24,495
Believe in your own power, Gohan!

26
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:29,245
Right now, you're the
strongest one in the universe!

27
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:33,085
U-Understood, Father!

28
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:37,835
I'll do everything that I can!

29
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:43,675
If that's what you think, then avenge me.

30
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:44,965
Right!

00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,185
<i>Ka...</i>

37
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,525
Th-This is going to be a problem! Get back!

38
00:03:52,325 --> 00:03:53,955
Gohan...

39
00:05:13,615 --> 00:05:17,375
The shape of the Earth is going to change!

40
00:05:17,415 --> 00:05:19,035
Damn...

41
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:30,385
It's no use trying to run any more,
no matter where we go! Huh?

42
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:32,975
Once again, the ground is being torn apart!

43
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:35,095
This is the end! We're finished!

44
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,515
Everyone, farewell! Farewell!

45
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:41,185
I-It's a trick!

46
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:44,565
I'm going to expose this trick
at some point, you just watch!

47
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:47,485
Are you still asserting that?!

48
00:05:56,535 --> 00:06:02,415
Cell has started his extermination!
This is the end of everything!

49
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:09,555
<i>Cell... Cell is completely overpowering him!</i>

50
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:14,345
<i>How could it be that not even Gohan-san</i>
<i>can stand up against Cell's power?</i>

51
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:17,345
<i>The Earth really is going to be blown away!</i>

52
00:06:23,605 --> 00:06:25,565
G-Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

53
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,365
Gohan, stand up to him!

54
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:45,665
To think that you could hold out
this long in your shape–I'm amazed!

55
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:06,145
Sure enough, it's no use!
He's completely overwhelmed!

56
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:10,775
Now, this is the end.
I'm putting an end to this!

57
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:29,005
Your son can handle this, huh?

58
00:07:45,015 --> 00:07:46,185
What's the matter?

59
00:07:46,225 --> 00:07:49,105
You still haven't summoned
up your dormant power!

60
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:53,405
I-It's too much. I'm at my limit.

61
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:54,785
It turns out I am just the weakling,

62
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:58,325
crybaby, spoiled little Son Gohan after all.

63
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:01,995
I haven't changed at all
from the way I was so long ago.

64
00:08:02,035 --> 00:08:04,585
You're wrong, Gohan!

65
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,455
Maybe you ain't aware of it, but up to now,

66
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:09,375
you've helped me many times!

67
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:11,505
If you get serious, and release your full power,

68
00:08:11,545 --> 00:08:14,505
like you did those other times,
you can beat Cell for sure!

69
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,765
What are you mumbling there?!

70
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:24,855
Have you given up, and
are now saying your prayers?

71
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,605
Stick with it, Gohan!

72
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,465
Incredible!

73
00:08:57,505 --> 00:09:00,385
Gohan's power...!

74
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:01,805
Gohan...

75
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:19,575
Miserable fool! I have attained
this ultimate, super-perfect form!

76
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,535
I will not be beaten by this level of power!

77
00:09:26,745 --> 00:09:28,205
What?

78
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:30,085
It can't be...!

79
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:42,425
<i>Th-This shouldn't be...!</i>

80
00:09:48,015 --> 00:09:49,895
I've got it!

81
00:09:49,935 --> 00:09:52,065
Gohan, somewhere in your mind,

82
00:09:52,105 --> 00:09:54,565
you're worried over how
much the Earth is being damaged!

83
00:09:57,355 --> 00:09:58,905
Don't concern yourself with that!

84
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,325
You can use the Dragon Balls to put
any damage done back the way it was!

85
00:10:01,365 --> 00:10:02,485
Go all-out on him!

86
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:05,155
B-But...!

87
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:11,455
Down! Down! Down to Hell with you!

88
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:23,305
Gohan...

89
00:10:35,355 --> 00:10:37,235
Hold on, Gohan!

90
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:44,445
Piccolo!

91
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,665
Piccolo!

92
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:53,705
He's gone to assist Gohan!

93
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:05,715
Cell! Take this!

94
00:11:13,935 --> 00:11:16,435
You're a nuisance! Get lost!

95
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,155
Piccolo...!

96
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,365
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

97
00:11:51,305 --> 00:11:53,265
Damn...!

98
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:56,145
G–

99
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:59,065
Gohan...!

100
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:05,365
<i>Piccolo...</i>

101
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:09,785
No matter how you slice it, that was reckless!

102
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:13,205
There isn't anything we can do!

103
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:15,665
Piccolo knows that well enough.

104
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,295
T-Tenshinhan...?

105
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,795
Hold on!

106
00:12:23,835 --> 00:12:27,175
Tenshinhan, don't tell me
you're thinking about doing it, too!

107
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:30,265
It's not in my nature to just sit
around like this doing nothing,

108
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:32,765
waiting for death to come.

109
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:35,315
What you're trying to say is
that you've got too much pride

110
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,185
as a martial artist, right?

111
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:38,355
That's right.

112
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:42,145
Even when it's hopeless,
I'd still rather face forward.

113
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:49,115
Kuririn, look after Trunks for us.

114
00:12:49,155 --> 00:12:51,035
N-Not you too, Yamucha-<i>san</i>!

115
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,285
Let's go!

116
00:12:59,415 --> 00:13:01,295
For the love of...!

117
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:03,585
They're all a bunch of daredevils.

118
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:13,765
<i>No. 18, I'm glad I got to see</i>
<i>you one more time, before the end.</i>

119
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:15,305
<i>Bye, now.</i>

120
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,575
Them, too?

121
00:13:29,615 --> 00:13:32,695
What are those good-for-nothings trying to do?

122
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:38,535
Raise your <i>ki</i> higher, Gohan!

123
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:44,125
Your struggling is useless.

124
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,465
I'm going to finish this once and for all!

125
00:14:00,815 --> 00:14:02,815
<i>Kiko-ho</i>!!

126
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:09,195
Yamucha-<i>san</i>! Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>! Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

127
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:11,865
Gohan! Raise your <i>ki</i> even higher!

128
00:14:11,905 --> 00:14:13,365
You can beat him!

129
00:14:13,405 --> 00:14:15,115
Father!

130
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:20,335
You pesky flies!

131
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:24,125
Th-They're all going to...

132
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:28,965
Is this how badly you
want to rush to your deaths?

133
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:31,135
In that case, I'll give you your wish!

134
00:14:34,385 --> 00:14:35,725
Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

135
00:14:37,265 --> 00:14:39,845
Dammit!

136
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:52,655
Gohan... I'm not going to let you die alone!

137
00:14:52,695 --> 00:14:58,615
You're the first one who
ever spoke to me decently.

138
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:05,165
Why am I even getting up again?

139
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:09,175
When I could just find peace by dying here?

140
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:12,755
In the past, I would have
already long-since given up!

141
00:15:12,795 --> 00:15:19,015
It must have been Goku and
Gohan that made me act this way.

142
00:15:19,805 --> 00:15:24,395
Yep, I've got you to blame
for this, both father and son.

143
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:33,155
<i>I've come to use Goku as a target for myself</i>

144
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:35,365
<i>as I've walked the path of the martial artist.</i>

145
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:39,205
<i>The reason I am who</i>
<i>I am now is because of Goku.</i>

146
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:41,245
<i>Now that I've let Goku die like he has,</i>

147
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:46,795
<i>I cannot allow his son Gohan</i>
<i>to die right before my eyes as well!</i>

148
00:15:46,835 --> 00:15:50,385
<i>Goku, Gohan is incredible.</i>

149
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,755
<i>He's just what we would</i>
<i>expect of any son of yours.</i>

150
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:56,135
<i>And I love the both of you.</i>

151
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:03,305
<i>Dammit...! I'm not afraid of him!</i>

152
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:12,735
Do not interfere, small fry!

153
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:22,205
Gohan! Raise your <i>ki</i> higher!
You're going to win this!

154
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:41,555
You're all so impudent, one right after the next!

155
00:17:09,245 --> 00:17:12,215
No matter how much trash like
you comes together, it's no use!

156
00:17:12,255 --> 00:17:14,255
Away with you!

157
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:49,165
It's no use!

158
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,295
The Earth will be blown away!

159
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:52,915
Damn...

160
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:11,355
G-Gohan... Is this where it ends?

161
00:18:11,395 --> 00:18:17,365
Sorry, Goku. We can't do
anything more at our power.

162
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:19,365
W-We're sorry.

163
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:20,865
<i>Gohan-san!</i>

164
00:18:21,825 --> 00:18:24,575
There's no way Gohan-<i>chan</i> can lose!

165
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:28,665
There ain't no way my Gohan-<i>chan</i> can lose!

166
00:18:29,415 --> 00:18:30,375
That's right!

167
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:34,585
Gohan is the son of Son Goku!
There's no way he's losin'!

168
00:18:38,425 --> 00:18:41,555
Withstand him. Withstand him, Gohan!

169
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:43,345
Father...!

170
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:46,895
You still aren't using all of your power!

171
00:18:46,935 --> 00:18:49,265
Let your power erupt!

172
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:51,055
Farewell!

173
00:19:11,825 --> 00:19:12,795
Vegeta?!

174
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:14,335
Now!!

175
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,015
What?!

176
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,245
Th-This can't be–!

177
00:20:58,225 --> 00:21:00,775
I-It's vanished...!

178
00:21:00,815 --> 00:21:03,395
Cell's <i>ki</i> has completely vanished...!

179
00:21:05,155 --> 00:21:08,695
H-He's finally been defeated, right?

180
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,285
Somehow or other, that's the way it looks...

181
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:17,585
He did it... Gohan finally
beat that Cell bastard...!

182
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:44,195
He did it! He did it! Gohan-<i>chan</i> did it!

183
00:21:45,315 --> 00:21:48,275
It's finally come to a conclusion, huh?

184
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:50,025
Yeah.

185
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,575
<i>Well done, Gohan!</i>

186
00:22:02,415 --> 00:22:06,585
<i>At last... at long last, Cell is defeated.</i>

187
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:11,765
<i>The battle is over, and the</i>
<i>Earth has been narrowly saved.</i>

188
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:17,265
<i>Thank you, Son Goku. And... farewell.</i>

189
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:48,465
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

190
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:54,305
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

191
00:22:54,345 --> 00:22:56,675
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

192
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:05,185
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

193
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:11,695
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

194
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:15,785
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

195
00:23:15,825 --> 00:23:19,285
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

196
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:21,955
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

197
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:29,465
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

198
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:33,555
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

199
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:35,345
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

200
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:39,395
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

201
00:23:39,435 --> 00:23:45,065
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

202
00:23:45,105 --> 00:23:47,235
<i>So sorry.</i>

203
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:52,355
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

204
00:23:55,115 --> 00:24:00,365
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

205
00:24:12,085 --> 00:24:14,255
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

206
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:17,175
<i>Cell has been beaten. Now we</i>
<i>have to hurry and bring Trunks,</i>

207
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:19,385
<i>and everybody else killed by Cell, back to life.</i>

208
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,845
<i>How can you be so casual about that, Goku?</i>

209
00:24:21,885 --> 00:24:24,975
<i>As it stands, you can't come back to life!</i>

210
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:27,105
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

211
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:30,695
<i>"I'm Going to Train In the Next World!!</i>
<i>A Smile at Parting."</i>

212
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:35,615
<i>Oh, no... Father, what am</i>
<i>I supposed to tell Mother?</i>

213
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:38,195
"Next time"
"I'm Going to Train In the Next World!!
A Smile at Parting"
