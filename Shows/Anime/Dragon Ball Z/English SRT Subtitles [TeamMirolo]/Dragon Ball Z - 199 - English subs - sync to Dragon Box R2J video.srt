<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:24,350
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,600
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,360
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,950
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:51,790
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,290
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,330 --> 00:01:04,300
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,810
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,900
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,320
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:26,240
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,830
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:36,670
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,630
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,690
<i>At last, Goku had advanced to the</i>
<i>final round of the Anoyoichi Tournament,</i>

17
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,820
<i>where he would fight Paikuhan.</i>

18
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,450
<i>Th-That's impossible!</i>

19
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
<i>During the battle, Paikuhan</i>
<i>acknowledged Goku's power,</i>

20
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,460
<i>and removed the weighted gear</i>
<i>that he wore to train himself with.</i>

21
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,890
In that case, me too...

22
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:36,660
<i>"Don't Let Victory Get Away!!</i>
<i>Finish With an Ultra-Fast Kamehame-Ha."</i>

23
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:08,030
<i>W-What sort of man is this?</i>
<i>His ki is rising sharply!</i>

24
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,830
W-What could this be?!

25
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,590
Contestant Goku has transformed,
and there is a golden glow about his body!

26
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,010
W-What?

27
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,380
W-What in the world happened to that kid?

28
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,520
Don't be so surprised. Goku has
just turned Super Saiyan, that's all.

29
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,350
Super...

30
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,520
...Saiyan, did you say?

31
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,700
That's right. You see, to put it simply,
so that even you can understand,

32
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,870
up until now, Goku hasn't meant business.

33
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,700
That's what this means.

34
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,490
What?!

35
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,370
Don't forget our bet, Kaio of the West!

36
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,540
If Goku wins, West Kaio's World is mine.

37
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,380
I know!

38
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,840
But as for not meaning business,
the same goes for Paikuhan, too!

39
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,570
E-Exactly what kind of fight are we
going to see unfold before us now?!

40
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,990
I cannot even make a prediction!

41
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,030
I ain't going to make any predictions either.

42
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,830
<i>Kamehame...</i>

43
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,620
<i>...Ha</i>!

44
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,720
You ain't getting away!

45
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,830
Over here, Goku!

46
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,140
<i>When did he have time to get over there?</i>

47
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,640
<i>I wasn't able to read his movement at all!</i>

48
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,230
By transforming, your power
appears to have risen quite a bit.

49
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,440
But even so, you still
can't keep up with me, huh?

50
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,480
I was expecting something a little better.

51
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,550
Take this! Hyper Tornado!!

52
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,980
D-Don't forget our bet, Kaio of the North!

53
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,280
I-I know!

54
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,610
What?

55
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,370
Goku! Your body has reached its limits!

56
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,730
W-What?!

57
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:07,660
Super <i>Kaio-ken</i>!!

58
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,420
<i>Ka... me...</i>

59
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:18,130
<i>ha... me...</i>

60
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,350
<i>Ha</i>!

61
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,550
What?!

62
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,990
He was so close! Just a little bit further and...

63
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,540
I-Incredible! It's not surprising
that the guys from my galaxy

64
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,870
didn't reach the second round like this.

65
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,420
It'll be another 500 years before
they're ready to fight those boys!

66
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,880
Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>, it
looks like after all this time,

67
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,510
there's going to be a martial
artist good enough to receive

68
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:49,390
the Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s
personal training, doesn't it?

69
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:57,270
<i>Th-That's right. I did make that promise,</i>
<i>didn't I? I had completely forgotten.</i>

70
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,400
I-I'm impressed you could take it this far.

71
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,490
Frankly, you're better than I anticipated.

72
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,410
That's because you're so strong.

73
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,330
When I fight against those who are strong,

74
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,330
I get happy, and become high-spirited.

75
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,960
The same goes for me about being happy,
enough so that I hate to have to end this.

76
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,380
What?!

77
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,520
Thunder...

78
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,270
...Flash!!

79
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,990
Thunder... Flash!!

80
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,820
<i>I-Incredible...</i>

81
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,900
<i>It's almost as if that technique</i>
<i>ain't got any vulnerabilities...</i>

82
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,120
<i>He's going to get me!</i>

83
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,580
Thunder...

84
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,460
...Flash!!

85
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,020
I almost got burned to a crisp!

86
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,020
O-Our ring, which we worked so hard to build!

87
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,980
Th-That lousy Paikuhan!

88
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,360
He launched that technique,
knowing that I was here!

89
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,700
I'm going to have to chew him out good later!

90
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,510
W-What in the world is happening up there?

91
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,680
I can't tell.

92
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,020
Contestant Paikuhan and
Contestant Goku have both risen so high,

93
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,020
we are unable to see them!

94
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,020
Just what is going on
with the match right now!?

95
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,110
Not bad...

96
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,080
<i>Kamehame-Ha</i>!!

97
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,670
<i>I shot at him head-on,</i>
<i>and he evaded it with ease!</i>

98
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,400
All right, now to finish you.

99
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,610
I'll knock you out of the
ring with my Thunder Flash!

100
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,030
Yikes!

101
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,130
<i>Stay calm...</i>

102
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,470
<i>there has to be a vulnerability</i>
<i>somewhere in that technique.</i>

103
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:02,300
<i>Spot it!</i>

104
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Thunder...

105
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,990
Now!

106
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,320
...Flash!!

107
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,160
<i>Kameha...</i>

108
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,170
<i>me...</i>

109
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,670
<i>Ha</i>!!

110
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,070
C-Contestant Paikuhan is out of bounds!

111
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:11,120
The winner of the Anoyoichi
Tournament is Contestant Son Goku!

112
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,560
You got me.

113
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,190
You shouldn't have launched
your Thunder Flash all of three times.

114
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:39,940
It was that third time that
I first saw your motions clearly.

115
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:46,110
I see. You really are something else.

116
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,450
Train hard with the Grand Kaio-<i>sama.</i>

117
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,460
I'll keep training, so I don't fall
behind, and beat you next time for sure.

118
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Yeah. But then, I ain't
going to fall behind, either.

119
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:06,970
Goku won! Goku won!

120
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,140
So then, I guess I'll be
taking West Kaio's World, huh?

121
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,140
Y-Yeah, I know!

122
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:19,150
And so, will the victorious
Contestant Goku please join me over here!

123
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,270
Just a moment!

124
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,990
Since there was a rule
violation during this match,

125
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,780
both Goku-<i>chan</i> and
Paikuhan-<i>chan</i> are disqualified!

126
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,830
Goku-<i>chan</i>, you and
Paikuhan-<i>chan</i> did indeed

127
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:42,170
touch foot on the ceiling of this arena, right?

128
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,800
The ceiling?

129
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,510
Yeah, we touched it.

130
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:57,100
According to Article 1351 of this
Anoyoichi Tournament rulebook,

131
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,940
the arena's ceiling and floor
are regarded as one and the same.

132
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,530
The reason being that if
you turn the ring upside-down,

133
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,030
the ceiling becomes the floor.

134
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,030
That's what it says here.

135
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,700
Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>, after
everything that happened,

136
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,040
isn't that asking too much?

137
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,500
I-It can't be!

138
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:22,040
That's a fantastic rule violation!
Fantastic! Fantastic!

139
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,510
Is that right? I guess I can't
help it if I broke the rules.

140
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,220
That's right. But you two did fight very well,

141
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,890
so if you train for another
two or three hundred years,

142
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:35,520
I wouldn't mind having another look at you.

143
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:40,520
Two or three hundred years, huh?
All right, I'll do my best!

144
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,520
<i>Phew, thank goodness!</i>

145
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,980
<i>Lately, I've been slacking off in my training,</i>

146
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:49,110
<i>and I'd probably get tuckered out</i>
<i>training with Goku-chan at his pace.</i>

147
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,240
<i>As such, Goku came to live</i>
<i>out his days in the Next World</i>

148
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,200
<i>in merry, spirited training.</i>

149
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,550
<i>And so, seven years' time went by...</i>

150
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,890
Okay, Mother, I'm off!

151
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,060
Oh, just a minute, Gohan!

152
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,490
Here! You forgot this!

153
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,910
For cryin' out loud,

154
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,740
you're just like Goku-<i>sa</i> when
it comes to bein' scatterbrained.

155
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,080
Okay, Mother, I'll be back soon.

156
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,460
Uh-huh. Make sure you listen
to what the teachers tell you.

157
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,920
Right.

158
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,090
Kinto Un!

159
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,300
Don't go speedin' too fast, now!

160
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,570
<i>Son Gohan, not having any schools as</i>
<i>such out in the country where he lived,</i>

161
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:12,990
<i>had relied upon self-study</i>

162
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:18,580
<i>and correspondence courses</i>
<i>from home up until now,</i>

163
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,790
<i>but his mother, Chichi, decided</i>
<i>that that alone wasn't enough,</i>

164
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,170
<i>and so starting today,</i>

165
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:27,880
<i>he would start going to</i>
<i>a high school in Satan City.</i>

166
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,230
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

167
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:54,070
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

168
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,450
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

169
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,910
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

170
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,460
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

171
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,550
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

172
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,050
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

173
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,680
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

174
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:29,190
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

175
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,320
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

176
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,110
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

177
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:39,160
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

178
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,830
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

179
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,000
<i>So sorry.</i>

180
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:52,130
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,130
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,440
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

183
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,190
<i>You sure have grown up, Gohan.</i>

184
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,280
<i>I hear that starting today,</i>
<i>you're going to high school in the city.</i>

185
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,070
<i>Gohan, you don't have to punish bank robbers,</i>

186
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,950
<i>and other dangerous stuff.</i>

187
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,450
<i>Go straight to school, and study hard.</i>

188
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,580
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

189
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:31,290
<i>"7 Years Since Then!</i>
<i>Starting Today, I'm a High School Student."</i>

190
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,210
<i>It sure is hard being normal</i>
<i>without people finding out who I am.</i>

191
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,760
"Next time"
"7 Years Since Then!
Starting Today, I'm a High School Student"
