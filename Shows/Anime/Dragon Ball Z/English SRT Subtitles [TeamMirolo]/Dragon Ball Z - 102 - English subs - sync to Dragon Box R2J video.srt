<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:24,700
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,970
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,290
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,660
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:04,670
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,140
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,250
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,650
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:26,600
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,170
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:37,040
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,980
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,170
<i>Owing to Goku's strong will,</i>

17
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,180
<i>everyone besides him and</i>
<i>Freeza were transported to Earth,</i>

18
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,710
<i>by the power of Planet Namek's Shen Long.</i>

19
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,020
But I've been waiting for this moment–

20
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,830
the moment when I could
fight you as hard as I want to!

21
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:36,360
<i>And so, under two minutes remain</i>
<i>until the explosion of Planet Namek!</i>

22
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:45,210
<i>"Let's Get It On!!</i>
<i>Two Remain on a Vanishing Planet."</i>

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,780
Either way, you will likely
be dead in two minutes.

24
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,690
You're quite the pitiable one.

25
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,860
You're the one who's pitiable.

26
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,730
After all, you're the one who's going to be
beaten by detestable Saiyan monkey scum.

27
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,970
Talk as big as you want,

28
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,970
the only one of us who can
escape the explosion of this planet

29
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,840
is <i>me</i>!!

30
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,590
Goku, there's no more time!

31
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,400
K-Kaio<i>-sama</i>, once Planet Namek explodes,

32
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,070
even supposing Goku defeats Freeza...

33
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,500
No matter that Goku
has become a Super Saiyan,

34
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,010
it's unlikely he can
survive in the vacuum of space.

35
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,880
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, is there no way to save Goku?

36
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:00,020
This is the path Goku chose for himself.

37
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,680
Y-You don't mean...

38
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,020
Yamucha!

39
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,360
Goku!

40
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,530
S-Son...

41
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,820
S-So what about Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

42
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,190
With the Earth's Dragon Balls,

43
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,260
one who has already been resurrected
once cannot be returned to life a second time.

44
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,260
Y-You mean...?

45
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,430
But Son<i>-kun</i> has only died once!

46
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:31,110
That man desired that everyone except
himself and Freeza be relocated to Earth.

47
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,380
T-Then Father is still on
Planet Namek with Freeza?

48
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,020
I-It can't be!

49
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,120
The planet is about to explode!

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,060
Planet Namek?! Grand Elder<i>-sama...</i>

51
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,400
G-Grand Elder<i>-sama...</i>

52
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,070
Unfortunately so.

53
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,030
I-It can't be...

54
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,440
That's ridiculous!

55
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,470
Not even Son could
survive the planet exploding,

56
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,350
even having defeated Freeza, right?!

57
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,350
S-Son...

58
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,820
If he wanted to, he could
have left Freeza behind

59
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,650
and returned to Earth together with us.

60
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,690
Son, you're really something...

61
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,200
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

62
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
Son, why did you have
me return to Earth as well?

63
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,280
I wanted to fight together with you!

64
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,320
Sorry I took so long.

65
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,120
Thanks to you guys, I've recovered.

66
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,020
I'll manage this from here on.

67
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,820
Much as I hate it, Son,

68
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,360
your power has now far exceeded my own.

69
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,040
In exchange for your own life...
You've always been like that.

70
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,140
That's so true.

71
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,040
Father!

72
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,350
I know just how Kakarrot feels.

73
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,360
Vegeta!

74
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:44,790
All Kakarrot wanted to do
was fight someone strong.

75
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,830
What's this?!

76
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,660
Have you come back to life as well?!

77
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,370
It would have been fine
if you'd stayed dead on us!

78
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,200
Too bad.

79
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,380
Yow!

80
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,380
You're here too?

81
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,050
I've had enough!

82
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,060
Get lost!!

83
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,690
Of all the–what is it with that frog?! Indeed!

84
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:24,670
Kakarrot and I both

85
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,370
have valiant blood of the
Saiyan Warrior Race flowing within us.

86
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,380
To say nothing of Kakarrot having
become a legendary Super Saiyan,

87
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,380
that's all the more reason he
won't rest until he has defeated Freeza.

88
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,520
However, the book is closed
on both Kakarrot and Freeza,

89
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,090
together with the planet Namek.

90
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,000
Stop laughing!!

91
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,330
Now that I've died and returned to life,
I should be that much stronger.

92
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,500
Once Kakarrot and
Freeza die fighting each other,

93
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:06,040
I automatically become the
strongest man in the universe!

94
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,040
Why, you...!

95
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,010
This is quite the unexpected turn of luck.

96
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,720
Fortune just keeps favoring me!

97
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:48,320
You and I are the only ones who
still possess the glory of Saiyan blood.

98
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,490
How about it? Why don't
you come along with me?

99
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,160
I will rule the universe in place of Freeza!

100
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,990
W-Who would ever team
up with the likes of you?!

101
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,060
I-I am an Earthling, the son of Son Goku!

102
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,160
T-That's right!

103
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,400
How can you be doing this while Son<i>-kun</i>
is risking his life to fight against Freeza?!

104
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,670
Kakarrot chose his own path by himself.

105
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,840
From now on, I am going
to have you obey my orders.

106
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,370
What?!

107
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,000
There's still a little time left
before the planet explodes.

108
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,380
You'll have to entertain me a little longer!

109
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,360
For Goku to have remained behind...

110
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,700
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

111
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,030
There's no time, Goku!

112
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,150
That's right!

113
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,480
There are Dragon Balls here
on Earth as well, aren't there?

114
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,320
If I call on Shen Long to have
me made undyingly youthful,

115
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,490
I can reign over the universe forever!

116
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,490
That won't be possible.

117
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,500
I hear the Dragon Balls were already
used in order to bring you all back to life.

118
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,530
They have now turned to ordinary
stone for a year's time. Tough luck!

119
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,840
I'm glad to be able to settle this with you.

120
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,210
I'm sure to win this fight!

121
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,050
Such insolence!

122
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:37,390
You've touched that which
must not be touched. Son Goku!

123
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,870
Goku!

124
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,030
Goku!

125
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,900
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>, do you know
what is happening on Planet Namek?

126
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,900
Son<i>-kun</i> is okay, right?
He's a Super Saiyan, isn't he?

127
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:01,410
Unfortunately, I can no longer ascertain
what is happening on Planet Namek.

128
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,810
O-Oh no...

129
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:08,020
Son is all right!

130
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,820
Piccolo<i>-san...</i>

131
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:15,490
He's sure to be all right!

132
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,020
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

133
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,380
Just what I'd expect of a Super Saiyan!

134
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,250
Very well. Let me explain to you clearly

135
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,950
why I will be the one who survives this!

136
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,370
Father...

137
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,560
Son<i>-kun</i>, don't die on me!

138
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,720
Son...!

139
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,370
<i>Father</i>!!

140
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,720
One more minute to your destruction!!

141
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,200
<i>The super battle to determine</i>
<i>who is the strongest in the universe,</i>

142
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,040
<i>as well as the time to</i>
<i>Planet Namek's explosion,</i>

143
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,180
<i>has fallen below one minute.</i>

144
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,710
<i>Which way will the outcome turn?</i>

145
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:48,580
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

146
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,420
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

147
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,790
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

148
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,290
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

149
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,800
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

150
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,900
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

151
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,410
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

152
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:22,040
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

153
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,550
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

154
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,650
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

155
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,460
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

156
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,490
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
