6

00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:08,865
I'm getting a little hungry, so this is
just right. What should I make them?

27
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:25,795
<i>And then, having merged through Fusion,</i>

Yo, yo, yo! Majin Boo! Come on out!

34
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:13,015
I know you aren't going
to keel over from just this!

Phew! That was a close one!

37
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:12,275
I-If the Earth had taken that head-on,

38
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:15,285
it would have been wiped out without a trace!

39
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:30,425
You dirty bastard!

40
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:33,425
You've done it now, you Boo-Boo swine!

41
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:34,885
Here I go!

42
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:40,305
<i>Renzoku Shine-shine Missiles</i>!
[<i>Renzoku Shine-shine</i>: Continuous Die-Die]

43
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:51,315
Stop, you fool! Are you trying to
blow away the Earth as we know it?!

44
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:56,155
It's okay, isn't it? After all,
there's nobody alive down there!

45
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:59,825
Don't forget that the Dragon Balls
are scattered all over the Earth!

46
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,705
If you destroy even one of them,

47
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:05,295
we can never return the
Earth back to the way it was again!

48
00:05:05,335 --> 00:05:06,995
Oh, is that right?

49
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:13,465
Well, that's okay. I've
already gotten him quite a bit!

50
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:16,255
Boo must be fairly weakened!

51
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:52,045
He hasn't been weakened at all!
This is pissing me off!

52
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:03,015
N-No, he is weaker!

53
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:07,855
I don't know about his physical strength,
but mentally, he's beginning to weaken!

54
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:13,405
This is a first for him–fighting
with someone as strong as you are.

55
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:17,405
At the very least, fighting with someone
of equal strength has him thrown off.

56
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:24,825
In other words, Majin Boo is flustered, right?

57
00:06:24,865 --> 00:06:29,545
I guess that would be true! My strength
leaves nothing to be desired, after all!

58
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:33,255
You could say I'm the strongest in the universe!

59
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:35,295
Don't let your guard down, Gotenks!

60
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:37,595
If you get too over-confident,
you'll be hurting later!

61
00:06:37,635 --> 00:06:40,265
He's going to start coming at
you like his life depends on it now!

62
00:06:40,305 --> 00:06:43,175
I don't mind, I don't mind! I hope he does!

63
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:58,735
Damn it all! Our hero left himself wide open!

64
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:07,075
Why, you...! Let me go, you big–!

65
00:07:18,465 --> 00:07:24,385
Oww! You're not getting
away with that any more!

66
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:27,225
Hang in there, Goten! Trunks!

67
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:28,895
Th-They're incredible!

68
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:32,935
To think they can fight
blow-for-blow with Majin Boo!

69
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:40,985
<i>I wonder how much longer.</i>
<i>If it's not soon, then I won't be in time...</i>

70
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:01,175
You scum!

71
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:12,305
I'm going to put you away here and now! Yea!!

72
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:24,195
Dammit!

73
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:35,335
This hurts!

74
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:37,915
Gotenks!

75
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:48,095
Why, you...!

76
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:52,055
Huh?!

77
00:09:14,285 --> 00:09:17,665
Now I'm mad! You've made me furious!

78
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:24,295
D-Don't get irritated, Gotenks!

79
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,125
You rotten...!

80
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:05,085
Back at you!!

81
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:37,165
Awesome! Awesome!

82
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:39,585
Gohan won't get a turn like this!

83
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,135
Now to finish you!

84
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:54,095
I'll blow you to pieces, then into little
chunks, then to shreds, then to bits!

85
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:57,055
This time, you won't be
able to return to normal!

86
00:10:57,095 --> 00:10:58,395
Once I blow you apart,

87
00:10:58,435 --> 00:11:01,855
I'm going to completely wipe
you out with my <i>ki</i>, you see?

88
00:11:04,235 --> 00:11:05,855
Die!!

89
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:10,575
H-Huh?

90
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:54,785
U-Uh oh! H-He went back to normal!

91
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:29,945
Hey!

92
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:53,345
Yeah, you got me, you got me!
How funny, how funny!

93
00:12:53,385 --> 00:12:55,765
I-It's hopeless!

94
00:12:55,805 --> 00:13:00,265
I-It's all over now! Damn!

95
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:03,315
Say, old man Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>! Hurry it up!

96
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:07,275
The little runts' Fusion has powered down!

97
00:13:07,315 --> 00:13:09,235
Really, Father?

98
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,445
Yeah! They're going to get killed like this!

99
00:13:11,485 --> 00:13:17,825
Okay, you can go!
You've been finished for a while now.

100
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,455
–F–
–F–

101
00:13:19,495 --> 00:13:21,455
Finished?!

102
00:13:21,495 --> 00:13:25,415
For a while now? Since how long ago?!

103
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:28,295
Hmm, since about five minutes ago, I suppose.

104
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:31,795
W-Why didn't you tell us sooner?!

105
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:33,965
You were just saying that since I got distracted,

106
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:35,425
it was going to take longer, didn't you?!

107
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:40,555
Ignorant fool! It's more dramatic for
you to go once there's a pinch, you know!

108
00:13:45,435 --> 00:13:48,855
Th-This is awful! In that case, I have to hurry!

109
00:14:06,455 --> 00:14:11,755
<i>A-At this point, bluffing and</i>
<i>anything else is fine! All right...!</i>

110
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:23,305
<i>Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack</i>!!

111
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:40,865
I may have returned to my normal form,

112
00:14:40,905 --> 00:14:44,245
but the force of my
techniques has been powered up!

113
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:48,785
Go ahead, ghosts! Knock Majin Boo flat!

114
00:14:53,795 --> 00:14:55,335
Hey, what should we do?

115
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:58,385
No way I'm doing that! He looks pretty strong!

116
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:02,925
Stop fussing around and go get him!

117
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:31,415
All right! Now, while I still can... Run!!

118
00:15:58,775 --> 00:16:03,405
H-How do I become the mightiest of
warriors, with strength beyond my limits?

119
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:08,455
Ah, well, you transform into that
Super-whatever-you-call-it often enough.

120
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:12,415
That's the gist of it. You just
have to get yourself fired up.

121
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:16,255
The gist of becoming Super
Saiyan, right? Understood!

122
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:17,875
H-Hey, just a moment!

123
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:32,665
U-Unmindful fool, becoming
like that while I'm nearby!

124
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,465
I-Incredible...

125
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:47,675
This is incredible, Father!

126
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:52,305
Y-You're right! It really
is incredible! Amazingly so!

127
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:58,775
Magnificent! Gohan-<i>san</i> has
certainly surpassed his limits.

128
00:17:58,815 --> 00:18:02,655
It's unbelievable! Absolutely!

129
00:18:02,695 --> 00:18:06,325
By looking at you, you
haven't changed all that much!

130
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:11,245
You ain't even Super Saiyan,
yet you've come to this extreme?!

131
00:18:11,285 --> 00:18:14,625
Hmph. It's not as though he has to transform.

132
00:18:14,665 --> 00:18:17,835
That Super-whatever-thing is depraved!

133
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:23,675
Gohan-<i>san</i>, quickly, to Earth! If we
don't hurry, the irreparable will happen!

134
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:26,805
Come with us, and we'll go to Earth!

135
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:32,265
No, I shall take Gohan-<i>san</i> there alone.

136
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,515
What are you saying, Kibit?

137
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:38,315
It is the Kaioshin's responsibility
to see things through to their end!

138
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:42,815
Once I have taken him, my
intent is to come right back here.

139
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,315
Begging your pardon, but if both of us go,

140
00:18:45,355 --> 00:18:48,235
we will only be slowing him down, will we not?

141
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:51,785
I do not want to get in the
way of this magnificent savior.

142
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:55,165
Kibit-<i>san...</i>

143
00:18:55,205 --> 00:19:00,705
I see. You are correct.
I understand. If you please...

144
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:05,885
Sorry, Gohan. I'm a man
of the Other World now.

145
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:08,845
Even though I want to go, it's impossible.

146
00:19:08,885 --> 00:19:13,845
I sure wish I could have seen you up
close–the way you've gotten so big...

147
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,845
Father...

148
00:19:15,885 --> 00:19:21,145
I ain't gonna see you again. Not until
you come to the Other World, that is...

149
00:19:24,735 --> 00:19:27,865
Good luck! Go blow Majin Boo away!

150
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:28,775
Right!

151
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,955
All right, go on!

152
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:44,915
Farewell, Father!

153
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:56,225
Why, that rotten...!

154
00:19:56,265 --> 00:20:01,805
He left and forgot to say thanks
to me, and I worked the hardest!

155
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:14,575
And so, excuse me. We're counting on you.

156
00:20:14,615 --> 00:20:17,205
Right! Um...

157
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:22,745
Kibit-<i>san</i>, I have a favor to ask.
Can I have you change this clothing?

158
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,255
I'd like you to make it the
same clothing as my Father's.

159
00:20:25,295 --> 00:20:29,755
Please, I want to fight wearing my Father's <i>gi</i>!

160
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:33,175
You don't say. It is a simple enough task.

161
00:20:33,215 --> 00:20:38,765
Um, the color is the same as the
droppings of the frogs on Planet Popol, right?

162
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,725
Um, it's the color of a <i>kerria</i> rosebush.

163
00:20:48,185 --> 00:20:51,655
Ah, that's perfect! Thank you very much!

164
00:20:51,695 --> 00:20:53,825
Well then, I will be going.

165
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:56,115
From the far distant Kaioshin Realm,

166
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:59,495
we will be wishing
victory for our grand warrior!

167
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:03,495
Farewell. Give my regards to
the two Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> as well.

168
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,805
All right, let's go!

169
00:21:40,785 --> 00:21:42,365
Dammit!

170
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:47,995
Huh?! Th-This is bad!
Our Fusion has come undone!

171
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:55,845
<i>Gotenks had pressed his attack</i>
<i>to within one step away, but now,</i>

172
00:21:55,885 --> 00:21:58,005
<i>even his Fusion has come unbound!</i>

173
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:03,645
<i>Goten and Trunks are in an absolute pinch!</i>

174
00:22:07,725 --> 00:22:09,895
<i>However, after having finished his training</i>

175
00:22:09,935 --> 00:22:14,235
<i>and achieving the ultimate</i>
<i>power-up, Gohan has returned!</i>

176
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:19,735
<i>Can he indeed become</i>
<i>the savior of the Earth?</i>

177
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:38,845
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

178
00:22:40,555 --> 00:22:45,385
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

179
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:55,985
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

180
00:22:56,025 --> 00:23:02,115
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

181
00:23:02,155 --> 00:23:09,085
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

182
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:14,465
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

183
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:18,345
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

184
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:27,395
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

185
00:23:27,435 --> 00:23:28,975
<i>Even now?</i>

186
00:23:29,015 --> 00:23:36,565
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

187
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:41,985
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

188
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:48,495
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

189
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:58,505
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

190
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,355
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

191
00:24:15,395 --> 00:24:18,405
<i>Okay, Gohan, show off</i>
<i>your powered-up strength!</i>

192
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,695
<i>Majin Boo, don't go weak</i>
<i>in the knees from the shock!</i>

193
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:23,035
<i>Unbelievable. What in the world happened?</i>

194
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:27,615
<i>How can his battle power top Boo's,</i>
<i>when he isn't even Super Saiyan?!</i>

195
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:29,665
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

196
00:24:29,705 --> 00:24:32,795
<i>"Boo Overwhelmed!!</i>
<i>Gohan's Miracle Power."</i>

197
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:36,455
<i>What's the matter, Boo? I thought</i>
<i>you were going to blow me away!</i>

198
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:39,625
"Next time"
"Boo Overwhelmed!!
Gohan's Miracle Power"
