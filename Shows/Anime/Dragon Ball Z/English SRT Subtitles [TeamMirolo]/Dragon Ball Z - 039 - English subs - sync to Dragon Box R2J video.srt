00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,760
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,040
P-Please take me, too, by all means!

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,570
I want to go, no matter what.

18
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,210
I want to be the one who
brings Piccolo<i>-san</i> back to life myself.

19
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,580
Piccolo's got nothin' to do with anythin'!

20
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,880
You are a little child,
and you should act like a child!

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,190
Shut up!

22
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,460
G-Gohan<i>-chan...</i> you've
turned into a delinquent!

23
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,630
M-Mother... right now... right now
really isn't the time to be talking about that.

24
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,000
We all fought desperately to save the Earth,

25
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,010
and we have to bring
those who died back to life,

26
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,180
to fight against the Saiyan once again!

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,470
<i>Seeking a new set of Dragon Balls,</i>
<i>the trio of Bulma, Kuririn, and Son Gohan</i>

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,010
<i>had departed for Planet Namek,</i>
<i>the native land of Kami-sama and Piccolo.</i>

29
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:23,590
<i>"Friends or Foes? Children of</i>
<i>the Mysterious Giant Spaceship."</i>

30
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,050
I am bored to death.

31
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,020
I've had it. This is still
only the seventh day, too.

32
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,600
We've still got twenty-some days to go.
I should have installed hibernation devices.

33
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:10,440
Are you guys image training again?

34
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,210
Nice for you to be able to pass the time.

35
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,070
Wow, you're not bad! You sure are strong.

36
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,440
You've inherited Goku's blood, and
you've been trained by Piccolo, after all.

37
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,840
Still, I was surprised by how
many techniques you have, Kuririn.

38
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,670
Listen...

39
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,840
It's fine for you to train inside your heads,

40
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,850
but the room is starting to get
pretty messy, so would you tidy it up for us?

41
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,820
There's a lady present.

42
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,020
B-But Bulma<i>-san</i>, you're the
one who made it messy over there.

43
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,860
We've cleaned up our own messes.

44
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,470
I'm busy here! I've got
a lot of things to think about.

45
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,370
You guys are just passengers,
so that's fine for you.

46
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,370
I thought you just got
done saying that you were bored.

47
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,010
You hush! I wish you would show a little
more consideration toward a delicate lady.

48
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,050
So busy, so busy...

49
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,580
As a lady, I sure wish she
wouldn't stroll around in her underwear.

50
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,990
Oh, not again.

51
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,040
Four more.

52
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,470
Son<i>-san</i>, you mustn't do that!

53
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,680
Nurse, I'm all better now.

54
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,620
Goku is immortal, you see.

55
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,420
Did I just do something? Must be my age,
but lately, I don't even know what I'm doing.

56
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,020
Oh, for heaven's sake...

57
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,430
These sponge cakes are delicious.

58
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,600
Of all the...

59
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,870
Doctor!

60
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,440
How many times must I say
it before it gets through to you?

61
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,880
If you keep doing that,
you'll never get to go home.

62
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,880
As you can see, I'm all–

63
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,890
It should hurt. You were very
severely injured, after all. Get back to bed.

64
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,890
S-Sorry.

65
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,860
You there, Grandpa Glad-hands, give him a hand.

66
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,870
"G-Grandpa Glad-hands"?

67
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,400
My word, "Grandpa Glad-hands," huh? My, my...

68
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,440
"Grandpa Glad-hands"!

69
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,880
At your service.

70
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,450
Where is his wife, who is usually with him?

71
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,020
Oh, she probably went to the
roof to look up at the sky again.

72
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,070
Gohan<i>-chan</i>, are you doin' all right?

73
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,340
I told you over and over
to send me a letter every day,

74
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,010
but you haven't sent a single one...

75
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:12,810
Come back to me soon, safe and sound.

76
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,460
Say...

77
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,460
By the way, I've been
wondering about this for a long time,

78
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,270
but about that Saiyan, Vegeta, who
ran away–where did he run away to?

79
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,470
What do you mean, where?

80
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,040
Well, the Saiyans' planet
was lost a long time ago, right?

81
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,140
Oh, right. He had taken an awful lot of damage,

82
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,550
so I think it would have to
be a civilized planet somewhere.

83
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,580
Could there be such a place?

84
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,920
Earlier, Son<i>-kun</i>'s brother
mentioned something, remember?

85
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,030
He said that, "We exterminate those
who live on planets with good environments,

86
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,300
and then sell them to aliens."

87
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,870
Do you think that maybe Vegeta went to
one of those aliens' planets to get treated?

88
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:13,870
If he did, then when he comes back to
Earth would depend on where that planet was.

89
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,040
If it was far away, then
it would buy us some time.

90
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,420
You know something, that's one
terrible fellow who has set his sights on Earth.

91
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,960
<i>T-To think that it would come to this...</i>

92
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,950
–What was that just now?
–Something flashed, huh?

93
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:56,380
It wouldn't be Planet Namek, right?

94
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,980
It's too early for that,
to say the least, isn't it?

95
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,390
Huh? Something is approaching.

96
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,630
But I don't see anything.

97
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,810
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>! Flying saucers!

98
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,390
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>!

99
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,390
Leave them to me!

100
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,630
Counterattack!

101
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,840
You got them! You got them!

102
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,620
It's too soon to celebrate. Look!

103
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,790
It's a spaceship.

104
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,960
It's coming closer and closer!

105
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,400
I can see that. It's coming straight toward us.

106
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,970
Is that...?!

107
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,800
We're going to hit!

108
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,000
Do something!

109
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,640
H-How could they turn in the same direction?!

110
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,980
W-We're done for!

111
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,920
Where could we be? It looks
like the inside of a spaceship,

112
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,820
but even so, there isn't a soul around.
I have no idea what's going on here.

113
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,990
There may be some weird aliens hiding from us.

114
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,430
You're right. They might suddenly–

115
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,830
...pop out, like this.

116
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,900
Gohan! Don't scare us like that!

117
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,640
I-It looks like it's safe to go
outside. Let's go have a look.

118
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,050
Here goes!

119
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:26,090
<i>Maybe I should have stayed</i>
<i>on Earth after all, like Yajirobe.</i>

120
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,490
Oh, no!

121
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:31,500
I forgot to put on some pants first.

122
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,930
Huh? But you <i>are</i> wearing them, aren't you?

123
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,500
These are my shorts. Ah, oh well.

124
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,940
Let's hope you don't embarrass mankind.

125
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,470
Kuririn<i>-san...</i>

126
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,040
All right, let's go.

127
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,820
Gohan! Don't push!

128
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,010
Gohan, watch yourself! It looks
like there are some booby traps in here.

129
00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,250
Remember, you two! Men are to
protect ladies at all times! Don't forget that!

130
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,230
There should be a doorway
into the main room somewhere–

131
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,070
A wall like this will be easy to take care of.

132
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,480
<i>Kame...</i>

133
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,450
<i>hame...</i>

134
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,090
K-Kuririn!

135
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,970
<i>Kame...</i>

136
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:59,010
<i>...hame-Ha!</i>

137
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,060
Must be nice for you guys,
being able to perform <i>Bukujutsu.</i>

138
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,930
I get the feeling that they want to
eliminate any intruders, no matter what.

139
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,500
Is this a Saiyan spaceship?

140
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,500
Beats me.

141
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,500
Suppose Vegeta were to
suddenly appear from over there...

142
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,480
C-Cut that out! Look,
I'm starting to get goosebumps!

143
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,050
I wonder if that man Vegeta is recovering
from his injuries somewhere right now.

144
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:40,860
I'd appreciate it if he'd just die.

145
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,440
<i>K-Kakarrot... remember this... I will</i>
<i>definitely go back there to settle the score!</i>

146
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,850
Say, I get the feeling

147
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,880
that we've been walking around
the same place in circles for a while now.

148
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,890
There wasn't anything
that looked like a door, huh?

149
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,860
There's one!

150
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,070
It looks like the real door is down here.

151
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,910
Yay!

152
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,650
Damn... They sure built
this thing to be convoluted!

153
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,510
All right, let's try going in here.

154
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:45,520
Kuririn, be careful.

155
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,080
I know.

156
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,240
Outer space!

157
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,500
I thought we were dead!

158
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,470
I-I'm getting hungry...

159
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,640
My tummy is grumbling, too.

160
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,480
Something smells good.

161
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,210
Y-You're right.

162
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,660
Wow, that looks delicious.

163
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,460
It might be a trap!

164
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,100
It sure is a spread!

165
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,870
Be careful when touching anything.

166
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,020
You won't catch me falling for that!

167
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,680
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

168
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,420
Help me!

169
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,390
Bulma<i>-san</i>, your reflexes are so slow!

170
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,990
It's you guys who are the unusual ones!

171
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,830
We're coming to help you out now!

172
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:12,430
Please move away from the cage!

173
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,410
What is this?! Who set this childish trap?!

174
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,440
Don't move!

175
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,650
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

176
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,250
Why, you!

177
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,900
Stay back! I'll be shot!

178
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,990
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, they're all children!

179
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,670
D-Don't shoot! We're not your enemy!
Is there an adult here that I could speak to?

180
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,810
Never mind about me! Give
these kids a good hard spanking!

181
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,980
B-But...

182
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,220
Don't dawdle around! Hurry up!

183
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,620
Okay then...

184
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,660
Kuririn! Don't offer any more futile resistance!

185
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,830
Just hurry and surrender, already!

186
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,670
B-Bulma<i>-san...</i>

187
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,510
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

188
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,240
W-What should we do?

189
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,880
<i>Ominously, these children</i>
<i>have suddenly appeared.</i>

190
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,850
<i>What exactly is the true nature</i>
<i>of this mysterious spaceship?</i>

191
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,020
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

192
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,890
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

193
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,260
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

194
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,760
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

195
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,240
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

196
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,340
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

197
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,850
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

198
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,520
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

199
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:27,030
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

200
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,100
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

201
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,930
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

202
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,000
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

203
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,670
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

204
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,840
<i>So sorry.</i>

205
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,950
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

206
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,920
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

207
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,340
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

208
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,640
<i>Huh? Gohan and the others have</i>
<i>been caught by a strange alien ship?</i>

209
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,570
<i>What in the world happened?</i>

210
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:19,310
<i>H-Hey, there's nothing</i>
<i>sinister about us! Listen to me!</i>

211
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:25,020
<i>Huh? Invaders? Freeza?</i>
<i>What are these guys talking about?</i>

212
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,850
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

213
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,920
<i>"Honest to Goodness?</i>
<i>There Lies Namek, Planet of Hope."</i>

214
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,830
<i>There's no choice but to act now!</i>

215
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,660
"Next time"
"Honest to Goodness?
There Lies Namek, Planet of Hope"
