16
00:01:51,075 --> 00:01:54,805
<i>Right in the middle of his battle</i>

18
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:18,295
<i>Goku was in an absolute pinch.</i>

19
00:02:25,175 --> 00:02:28,105
<i>It was Vegeta who came to Goku's aid.</i>

20
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:34,115
<i>At length, Vegeta had become</i>
<i>a legendary Super Saiyan as well.</i>

21
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:37,115
I was left shaking from the joy it gave me.

22
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:38,815
I had overcome Kakarrot,

23
00:02:38,855 --> 00:02:43,125
and the time had come for me
to return as Prince of the Saiyans!

24
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:45,125
Regardless of what you may
have changed yourself into,

25
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,295
you are still no match for us Artificial Humans.

<i>The Secret of Doctor Gero."</i>

Yeah, I guess that's about the level you'd be.

28
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:52,725
I failed to mention something...

29
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:57,035
When we become Super Saiyans,
our ferocity increases somewhat.

30
00:03:57,075 --> 00:04:00,835
We become lightly over-excited.

31
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:04,235
You guys don't feel pain, do you?

32
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,875
How lucky for you.

33
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:30,635
So strong!

34
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:44,045
What's wrong?

35
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:47,855
Have your rummage sale
puppet calculations gone awry?

36
00:05:15,545 --> 00:05:17,975
Well, weren't you put together well?

37
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:21,315
Is that blood there? Or is it oil?

38
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:09,895
I've got you!

39
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:14,275
I won't let go until I've
absorbed all of your energy!

40
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:19,275
Oh, no!

41
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:26,615
Kicking won't do any good.
I absolutely will not let go.

42
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:30,885
Absolutely, you say?

43
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,865
Don't you let go!

44
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,855
<i>Goku, it's okay.</i>

45
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:06,925
<i>Everyone else will take care of those guys.</i>

46
00:07:06,965 --> 00:07:09,125
<i>We will change history.</i>

47
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,075
Sure enough.

48
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:26,205
You guys really do suck
energy out through your hands.

49
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,445
Then you take that energy
and add it to your own.

50
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:35,245
You expect me to let go?

51
00:07:35,285 --> 00:07:38,585
You absolutely will not let go of me.

52
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,855
Absolutely not!

53
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:23,635
So then, this is the area on your palms...

54
00:08:23,675 --> 00:08:25,865
...that you used to absorb your energy, is it?

55
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:35,475
I've had quite a bit drawn out of me,

56
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,505
but I figure you won't be doing that any more.

57
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:48,825
You feel fear, do you,

58
00:08:48,865 --> 00:08:51,225
even though you're an Artificial Human?

59
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:11,575
Why, you...

60
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,185
Not so fast!

61
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,485
After I'm finished with him,

62
00:09:14,525 --> 00:09:16,885
then I can take all the time I need against you!

63
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,205
What is it?!

64
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:42,045
Take this!

65
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:46,885
It's Super Vegeta's Big Bang Attack!

66
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,185
Huh? What's that smoke there?

67
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:28,545
I know!

68
00:11:28,585 --> 00:11:33,025
That island must be where everyone
is fighting the Artificial Humans!

69
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,525
Hey! Don' tell me yer fixin'
to take us down to that island?

70
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,525
Naturally, of course I am.

71
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:42,525
You idiot! Don' you dare!

72
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:46,135
–What do you think you're doing?
–Cut that out!

73
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:51,935
With all this shouting, you've made him cry!

74
00:11:51,975 --> 00:11:53,345
When that baby gets in a bad mood,

75
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:56,175
he tends to wet himself, so watch out!

76
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,385
Fool! I'm tellin' ya to turn back!

77
00:12:35,185 --> 00:12:38,555
We certainly appear to have miscalculated.

78
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:43,995
But, as before, there is no
possibility of you coming out victorious.

79
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:55,165
I've been considerably drained
of energy by that other one.

80
00:12:57,615 --> 00:13:00,575
If you're going to beat me, now is your chance.

81
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:03,015
Bring it on.

82
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:14,155
<i>Does he... have some sort of strategy here?</i>

83
00:13:14,195 --> 00:13:15,955
You were ranting to
yourself just now, weren't you?

84
00:13:15,995 --> 00:13:20,525
About how we have absolutely
no chance for victory?

85
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:24,565
I can't say I feel the same way.
What did you mean by that?

86
00:13:27,575 --> 00:13:30,535
I meant that no matter how unimaginably
strong you may have become,

87
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:34,575
it still is not enough to
defeat the Artificial Humans.

88
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:40,025
So it's nothing more than you
being a poor loser then, is it?

89
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:47,785
He-He's running away!

90
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:49,885
He's planning on hiding himself in those rocks!

91
00:13:54,005 --> 00:13:55,125
Hey, Kuririn!

92
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,535
Give me one of those senzu!

93
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:59,195
Eh?

94
00:14:01,575 --> 00:14:02,535
But...

95
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,135
Hurry it up!

96
00:14:04,175 --> 00:14:06,575
Do you want him to get away?

97
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:11,545
Give it to him, Kuririn.

98
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:13,175
All right.

99
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:19,025
Here!

100
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:22,855
<i>Could you have made that any less snappy?</i>

101
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,195
<i>You stupid idiot!</i>

102
00:14:28,805 --> 00:14:30,425
<i>All right!</i>

103
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,935
You guys go on home...

104
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:38,905
...and have yourselves a
relaxing glass of milk or whatever.

105
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:41,385
Just stay out of my way!

106
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:53,955
Damn him! Where does he get
off telling us to go drink milk?!

107
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:58,125
He actually allowed himself
to lose quite a bit of his power.

108
00:14:58,165 --> 00:15:02,195
He purposely let the fight go
on long enough to confirm...

109
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:06,175
...that the Artificial Humans
draw in energy through their palms.

110
00:15:08,605 --> 00:15:11,435
If he had fought with
that No. 20 guy just now,

111
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,545
he likely would have lost.

112
00:15:13,585 --> 00:15:17,545
Instead, he came across like he
had something more up his sleeve.

113
00:15:17,585 --> 00:15:21,145
Vegeta really does have a gift for battle.

114
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:34,995
He might have even surpassed... Goku.

115
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:40,565
Regardless, I'm going after them!

116
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:43,165
Even if it's just to confirm with my own eyes...

117
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:45,575
...that the Artificial Humans are finished.

118
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:46,775
Me too!

119
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:48,905
I'm going too!

120
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:50,005
If we stop now,

121
00:15:50,045 --> 00:15:53,715
then I won't understand why
I went through all that training!

122
00:15:54,555 --> 00:15:56,515
All right then.

123
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,455
But do not attempt to fight.

124
00:15:58,495 --> 00:16:01,555
That guy is more than any of you can handle!

125
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:06,625
He will be using the rocks to conceal himself.

126
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,525
Since he's an Artificial Human,

127
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:11,135
you can't count on being
able to sense him, either.

128
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:14,835
If you find him, let Vegeta
or myself know immediately.

129
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,635
And be extremely cautious over there.

130
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,505
–Right!
–Let's go!

131
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,825
Where are you?! Come on out!

132
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,425
You coward!

133
00:17:15,465 --> 00:17:17,965
Show yourself!

134
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,355
Dammit.

135
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,625
He's using this topography
to his advantage, all right.

136
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:50,005
In that case, I'll just have to drive him out.

137
00:18:09,685 --> 00:18:13,145
I'll just blow all of these rocks away!

138
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:22,265
Stop! The rest of us are down here too!

139
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:23,925
Take this!

140
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:19,595
I accept your energy!

141
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,895
Shoot!

142
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,205
<i>Damn you–!</i>

143
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:03,595
Dammit. He's a lot faster than I thought.

144
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,945
Looks like he's gotten too used...

145
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:21,215
...to using an opponent's
<i>ki</i> to follow their moves.

146
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,555
I am able to follow your movements quite well,

147
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:27,425
but I doubt you'll ever find me.

148
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:35,425
<i>On the other hand,</i>

149
00:20:35,465 --> 00:20:38,565
<i>who would have thought</i>
<i>Vegeta could be so strong?</i>

150
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:40,195
<i>What am I going to do?</i>

151
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:42,565
<i>I don't have a chance against him.</i>

152
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:45,605
<i>Looks like I have no choice</i>
<i>but to return to the laboratory.</i>

153
00:20:46,615 --> 00:20:51,605
<i>I wanted to avoid the</i>
<i>laboratory, if at all possible...</i>

154
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,585
<i>He's here too?</i>

155
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:51,015
There's plenty of targets creeping
around that I can steal energy from.

156
00:22:07,865 --> 00:22:12,525
I'll drain all of their energy,
and add it to my own!

157
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:15,005
Then I can beat Vegeta!

158
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,735
<i>The cunning Artificial Human No. 20...</i>

00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:22,535
<i>If left unchecked, something</i>
<i>terrible is bound to happen.</i>

160
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:28,575
<i>And what is happening at</i>
<i>Doctor Gero's laboratory?</i>

161
00:22:44,365 --> 00:22:48,365
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

162
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:54,205
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

163
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:56,575
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

164
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:05,075
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

165

<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

166

<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

167

<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

168
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:21,825
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

169
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:29,335
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

170
00:23:31,575 --> 00:23:33,435
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

171
00:23:33,475 --> 00:23:35,245
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

172
00:23:35,285 --> 00:23:39,275
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

173
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:44,955
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

174
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:47,115
<i>So sorry.</i>

175
00:23:47,155 --> 00:23:52,255

<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

178
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:16,645
<i>What did you say, Trunks?</i>

179
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:20,185
<i>These are different from the</i>
<i>Artificial Humans you know?</i>

180
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,125
<i>That's impossible.</i>

181
00:24:22,165 --> 00:24:26,795
<i>Then, who is this guy we're fighting now?!</i>

182
00:24:26,835 --> 00:24:28,825
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>
