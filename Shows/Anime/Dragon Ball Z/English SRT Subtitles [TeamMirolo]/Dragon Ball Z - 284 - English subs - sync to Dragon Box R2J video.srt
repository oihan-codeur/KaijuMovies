<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,960
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,630
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:48,890
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,610
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,230
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,540

<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,980
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

<i>Majin Boo is dramatically</i>
<i>stronger than any previous foe.</i>

24
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,140
<i>Has every last means of</i>
<i>defeating him been lost?</i>

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,390
V-Vegeta, what are you doing?

26
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,690
It's still too soon to be using the Dragon Balls.

27
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,440
Kakarrot, how many times have
you saved the Earth up to now?

28
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,910
What's this, all of a sudden?

29
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,460
It's time to let the guys on Earth
take responsibility for a change.

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,470
<i>And with that, Vegeta then suddenly</i>
<i>used the Dragon Balls of Planet Namek</i>

31
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,180
<i>to bring back the Earth and the Earthlings.</i>

32
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,490
<i>Vegeta's idea was to...</i>

33
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,080
We're starting! Get ready!

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,660
Ready? For what?

35
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,500
Get ready to make a <i>Genki Dama</i>!

36
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,790
A-A <i>Genki Dama</i>? A <i>Genki Dama</i>, you say?!

37
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:27,130
<i>"A Last Hope!!</i>
<i>We'll Make a Huge Genki Dama."</i>

38
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,980
We didn't die!

39
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,360
We're saved!

40
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,820
Huh? Did I come back to life?

41
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,610
Thank goodness, Mother! Thank goodness!

42
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,990
What on earth is going on?

43
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,550
What the hell happened?

44
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,390
Never mind us, even the cities have
been returned to the way they were.

45
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,810
Good question. I don't have any idea.

46
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,810
Say, where did that Majin Boo guy go?

47
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,810
Satan isn't here, either.

48
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,900
Don't tell me Satan managed to...?!

49
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,020
I guess there's no way he could have, huh?

50
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,820
Thank goodness!

51
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,370
We were training at Kaio-<i>sama</i>'s place.

52
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,750
So that's why you weren't in Heaven, huh?

53
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,750
I was thinkin' that you'd gone to Hell.

54
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,620
That's awful!

55
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,460
–We wouldn't go!
–Papa!

56
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,550
Papa!

57
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,100
Papa! I missed you!

58
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,470
H-Hey, cut it out! This is
embarrassing, in front of everyone!

59
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,800
How nice for you, everyone!
To be able to return to life!

60
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,300
I committed too many sins, so I couldn't,

61
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,600
but I will pray for everyone's
peace from Heaven here!

62
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:51,150
Hey, Vegeta, your idea
was to use a Genki Dama?

63
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,740
That's right.

64
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,660
So that's it! You've thought
this out, huh Vegeta?

65
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,290
Surely, with a <i>Genki Dama,</i>
we might be able to defeat Boo!

66
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:16,970
Hang in there, Boo! That's it!
To the body! Hook! Uppercut!

67
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,810
What's the matter, Boo?

68
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,230
If this is my dream, you should
definitely be winning! My Boo!

69
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:49,420
Y-You turn into candy!

70
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,810
B-Boo!

71
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,270
Shake it off, Boo!

72
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,120
Say, it's impossible,
ain't it? With a <i>Genki Dama</i>?

73
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,420
Even if I were to gather a
little bit of <i>ki</i> from everyone...

74
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,920
I told you, didn't I?

75
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,420
Let the folks on Earth take
responsibility for a change.

76
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,590
Besides, you're not going
to get a little from everyone.

77
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,590
You're going to push
everyone right to their limit!

78
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,630
Right to their limit?

79
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,360
Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

80
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,040
Polunga is telling us to say the third wish!

81
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,580
The third one doesn't matter!
Do whatever you want!

82
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,290
You can't mean... for me to
do whatever I want would be...

83
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,960
Never mind, listen!

84
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,590
Is Kaioshin listening?

85
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,590
Y-Yes!

86
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:24,600
I want to talk to all the people
on Earth! Do something about it!

87
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,020
B-By that, do you mean like the way
Madoshi Babidi used magic to do so?

88
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,520
That's not something I can do!

89
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,450
Th-That will be impossible, I'm afraid.

90
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,990
W-What?!

91
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,990
Leave that to me!

92
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,450
Who's that?!

93
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,500
Th-That voice! It's Kaio-<i>sama</i>, right?

94
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,500
You guessed it!

95
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,510
Vegeta, for you to choose my <i>Genki Dama</i>
as your finishing technique was nice!

96
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:03,430
Okay, talk! Never mind Earth,
you can talk to the whole universe!

97
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,800
That will help a lot!

98
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:14,020
Do you hear me, people of the world?!

99
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,610
I am speaking to you from some other place.

100
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:24,030
I believe you already know, but
most of you were killed by Majin Boo.

101
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:28,450
However, through a mysterious power,
I had you brought back to life.

102
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,540
Your cities and houses and such should
also be returned to just the way they were.

103
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,500
However, this is by no means a dream!

104
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,010
N-Not a dream?

105
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:43,840
H-Hey, what's he talking about?

106
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,560
He's talking to everyone on Earth.

107
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,360
I-I knew this was a dream!

108
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:01,400
H-Hey, you guys! If you've got
time for this worthless spacing off,

109
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,360
then help Boo out, would you?

110
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:11,370
We know! Just hold on a moment!

111
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,920
Right now, in a certain location,

112
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,920
there is a warrior who is
fighting Majin Boo in your place!

113
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,340
However, to be honest, you could
say that our odds are pretty bad.

114
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,890
I-It's Vegeta! It's Vegeta's voice!

115
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,640
Majin Boo's strength far exceeds even Cell's!

116
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,350
Vegeta...!

117
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,900
And so, we want to make use of your power!

118
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,530
Raise your hands to the sky!

119
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:47,570
Gather your energy together and defeat Boo!

120
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,540
It will wear you out
considerably, but don't worry!

121
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,250
It will be just like after
you run as hard as you can!

122
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,460
Now, do it! Raise your hands!

123
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,390
What a lousy approach towards
making requests this guy has!

124
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,350
For crying out loud...

125
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,940
All right, Kakarrot! Get started!

126
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,940
Right!

127
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,940
Not bad, Vegeta! I've got
to give you more credit!

128
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,920
Everyone! Share your <i>Genki</i> with me! Please!

129
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,920
That's it! A <i>Genki Dama</i>!

130
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,840
You got it, Papa!

131
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,390
Hmph! Vegeta! This stunt isn't like you!

132
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,450
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes!

133
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,500
It's so huge all of a sudden!

134
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,370
This is from Gohan and the others!
Ha! This is awesome, all right!

135
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:58,450
With just the <i>ki</i> from them,
it's already gotten this huge!

136
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:07,800
<i>That's it! Great! More! More!</i>

137
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,600
Come on! More of you, raise your hands!

138
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,930
Understood, Vegeta! Here!

139
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,940
L-Like this?

140
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,650
–Here!
–Here!

141
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,920
Yahoo!

142
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,050
This time it's Kuririn and
Bulma and those guys' <i>ki</i>!

143
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,300
Way to go, Vegeta!

144
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,930
<i>It's working! It's working!</i>

145
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,980
They've done it!

146
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,600
Goku-<i>san</i>! Quickly now, finish Boo off!

147
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,610
Incredible! To think that a
method such as this still remained!

148
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,990
Really, what incredible people they are!

149
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,990
Yay!

150
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,620
This is strange!

151
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,450
If they're getting power
from all of the folks on Earth,

152
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,330
then that <i>Super Genki Dama</i> has
no business being only that large!

153
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:31,010
From here on... from here on,
it will get larger! I'm sure it will!

154
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,880
Y-Yeah...

155
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:47,610
Polunga, you're certain that everyone who
was wished for has come back to life, right?

156
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,610
Of course, I am certain.

157
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,530
More importantly, do you
not have a third wish yet?

158
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,280
Th-The Kaioshin Realm!

159
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Dammit, no!

160
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,220
Didn't we make it in time?

161
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,730
Damn it all! We were so close!

162
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,080
Hey! Look–look over there!

163
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,940
Boo hasn't had it yet!

164
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,320
Geez, don't scare me like that!

165
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,990
Vegeta!

166
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,990
It hasn't gotten the
slightest bit bigger since then!

167
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:07,450
This much probably still
ain't enough to defeat Boo yet!

168
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,460
Strange... it should have
long since been completed!

169
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,460
W-Why isn't it?

170
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,000
Hey, he said to raise our hands!

171
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,460
What good will it do to do that?

172
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,430
W-W-What's that?
Why am I hearing those voices?

173
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,600
Who the hell was that?

174
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,430
That was some dubious voice!

175
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,850
W-What did you say?!

176
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,610
Something I don't trust about this, you know?

177
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:38,150
Yeah. Who do they think is
going to raise their hands?

178
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,450
That was kind of creepy, huh?

179
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,450
Let's go, let's go!

180
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,620
Hey, now, I'm hungry!

181
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:50,540
Oh? I suppose so. How about
we go get something to eat?

182
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,540
–Don't fall for it!
–It doesn't have anything to do with us!

183
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,420
W-What was that?!

184
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,010
L-Look here! Shh! Be quiet!

185
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,430
Don't fall for it, you say?!
It has nothing to do with us, you say?!

186
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:16,020
Damn it to hell!! What sort of
rubbish are you talking about?!

187
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,570
It's your Earth!!

188
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,360
How long are you going to act so
spoiled before you're finally satisfied?!

189
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,120
<i>What's the matter with everyone on Earth?</i>

190
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,200
<i>This Genki Dama isn't getting</i>
<i>even the least bit more Genki!</i>

191
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,560
Oh, my! Boo!

192
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,150
Boo!

193
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,610
B-Boo!!

194
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,280
I-It's no use any more! Please! Help Boo out!

195
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,920
<i>Dammit! I won't ask any more!</i>

196
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,510
Hey! Out of my way!

197
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:09,510
Wait! Don't be hasty, Vegeta!

198
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:12,850
You fool! How can you ask like that?!

199
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:16,350
Don't give up, you've got to keep
on persuading everyone on Earth!

200
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,560
There's no other way for
the universe to be saved!

201
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,540
Listen, Earthlings!

202
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,540
I'm saying this one more time!

203
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:42,000
Stop your whining! All you
have to do is raise your hands!

204
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,090
This isn't going to work.

205
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:03,520
Too bad, Vegeta. It was a good idea, though.

206
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:11,320
You understand, don't you, that
Earthlings are this level of race, after all?

207
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,920
W-What are you doing, Vegeta?!

208
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,920
Aside from our friends, just about
nobody is giving up any <i>ki</i>, you know!

209
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,380
I know!

210
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,220
But nobody there believes
a damn thing I'm saying!

211
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,520
Damn!

212
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,570
Hey! Earthlings! Cooperate, right now!

213
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,530
Do you want to get killed by Majin Boo again?!

214
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,530
This is not a dream, or anything! I am serious!

215
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:00,450
Why don't you... why don't you
lend us your power for a change?!

216
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,050
<i>Again and again, the Earthlings utterly</i>
<i>refuse to listen to what Vegeta tells them.</i>

217
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:16,800
<i>The Super Genki Dama is the only</i>
<i>thing that can dispatch Majin Boo now!</i>

218
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,700
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

219
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,290
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

220
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:55,840
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

221
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,970
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

222
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:08,980
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

223
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:14,360
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

224
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,200
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

225
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:27,290
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

226
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,830
<i>Even now?</i>

227
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:36,470
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

228
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:41,890
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

229
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:48,350
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

230
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:58,400
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

231
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,720
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

232
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,720
<i>With the universe in this much trouble,</i>

233
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,840
<i>why won't everybody cooperate?!</i>

234
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,140
<i>You people! Don't you hear</i>
<i>the request of Mister Satan?!</i>

235
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,230
<i>I need to defeat Boo, so hurry</i>
<i>up and lend me your strength!</i>

236
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,310
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

237
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,980
<i>"Ultra-Impressive!! The Genki Dama</i>

238

<i>There it is! The extra-large</i>
<i>Genki Dama is finished!</i>
