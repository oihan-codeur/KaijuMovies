<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>

00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:24,810
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:36,820
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,400
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,270
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,770
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,810 --> 00:01:04,780
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:14,360
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,760
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:26,710
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,280
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,150
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,090
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,450
<i>As Bulma and the others</i>
<i>search for the Dragon Balls,</i>

17
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,660
<i>they have already</i>
<i>obtained five of them. However...</i>

18
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,540
You are now healed. You may open your eyes.

19
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,040
Unfortunately, we were not
able to regenerate your tail.

20
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,010
No matter. It will grow back in time.

21
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:47,290
<i>Vegeta has recovered at last. That</i>
<i>which was feared is about to begin again.</i>

22
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:55,900
<i>"The Dragon Balls Are All Found!</i>
<i>Piccolo-san Will Also Come Back to Life."</i>

23
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,690
Brr...

24
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,870
H-Hurry it up! Are you
trying to freeze me to death?!

25
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,040
You can't ask us to do that.

26
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,510
He's right. If we melt it too fast,
this whole cave could collapse.

27
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,960
I get it! I get it already, so just hurry it up!

28
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,960
Ah, man! I'm sure this
cold is no good for my skin!

29
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,960
If my beauty is ruined because of this,
it would be a serious loss for the universe,

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,630
wouldn't it, Zarkuro<i>-san</i>?

31
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,830
Huh? Where could he have gone?

32
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,010
Bulma<i>-san</i>, just a little more.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,660
We did it! The sixth one!

34
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,830
One more to go!

35
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,000
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

36
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,270
What?

37
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,780
What is this?! I thought you were
going to keep this from happening!

38
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,850
If you're going to complain,
tell us later! Let's just hurry!

39
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,700
Kuririn, do something, quick!

40
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,440
Wah! Oh no!

41
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:55,370
Left! Left! Go left!

42
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,710
All right!

43
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,930
Ho, ho, not bad.

44
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,200
But they're finished now.

45
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,080
I guess we can relax now.

46
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,090
This is no time to relax!

47
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,790
Vegeta<i>-sama</i>, as powerful as you are,
you sure must have had a hard time of it.

48
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,800
As busted up as this
high-quality rubber protector is,

49
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,730
I'm surprised you came back to us safely.

50
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:59,940
It would take quite a lot
for it to end up like this.

51
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,570
What in the world happened
to you on that planet Earth?

52
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,820
Is Freeza<i>-sama</i> around?

53
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,790
N-No, he has departed.

54
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,790
He's already gotten tired of this planet, huh?

55
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,330
Um... Kewie<i>-sama...</i>

56
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,330
...said that he had something
to speak to you about,

57
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,770
and that you were to come to the training
room when your treatment was finished.

58
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:36,780
Ha! You tell him that I said, "I've got
nothing to discuss with the likes of you."

59
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,980
B-But...

60
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,150
Vegeta<i>-sama...</i> um...
you've forgotten your Scouter.

61
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,820
I don't need that thing. You can have it.

62
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,980
It's no good... I ain't able
to control my power at all...

63
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,160
Damn...

64
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,100
I've had it.

65
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,160
I ain't even able to perform the
<i>Kaio-ken</i> like this, let alone a <i>Genki Dama.</i>

66
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,590
Hurry up and do something!

67
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,030
Gohan, up there!

68
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,800
Right, understood!

69
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,010
An outlet?

70
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,640
Lucky! There's an outlet!

71
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,170
I see an outlet!

72
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,150
You're right!

73
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,200
That was close.

74
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,760
Okay, one more to go.

75
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,270
Right.

76
00:11:55,410 --> 00:12:00,410
Say, Bulma<i>-san</i>, don't you
think this is a little bit strange?

77
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,670
What?

78
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:05,480
N-Nothing, really. Never mind.

79
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,020
It's almost time, huh?

80
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,660
Yeah.

81
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,240
It's just ahead. We're nearly there.

82
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,200
Isn't this where we were before?

83
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,060
What's the matter?

84
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,460
We'll leave you behind.

85
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,040
It looks like the Dragon Ball is in that lake.

86
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,230
There doesn't seem to be any doubt.

87
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,770
It has to be inside that stone figure.

88
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,370
Judging by all the other
events we've had up to now,

89
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,200
it doesn't look like this
is going to be easy, either.

90
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,380
It would be a relief if Lychee<i>-san</i>
or Zarkuro<i>-san</i> were here, huh?

91
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,210
What are you worrying about?

92
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,820
This one out here is going to be a
simple affair compared to the others, isn't it?

93
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:26,220
I don't see you going out to get it.

94
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,090
One more to go.

95
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,090
One more, and then Kami<i>-sama</i>
and Piccolo can both come back to life.

96
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,190
Right.

97
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,190
But Bulma<i>-san...</i>

98
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,830
And once that happens, the Dragon Balls
will be restored and we can return to Earth,

99
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,860
and bring Yamucha, Tenshinhan
and everyone back to life, can't we?

100
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,980
Then we can all go back to our regular
lives, and Earth will be at peace, won't it?

101
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,280
Am I right?

102
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:59,280
Then I can put some makeup on, and go back
to being the usual beauty that I am, can't I?

103
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:05,130
Don't you boys forget that
you're on a mission to save Earth.

104
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,990
A-All right.

105
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:19,180
<i>One more to go, huh? One more, and</i>
<i>then Piccolo-san will come back to life!</i>

106
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:44,400
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

107
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,270
Help me! I can't move!

108
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,670
W-What's wrong, Gohan?!

109
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,680
Geez, this is no time to be
playing around, Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

110
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,680
I can't move! It's like I'm
being held by an incredible power!

111
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,120
Gohan!

112
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,310
There he is. Over there.

113
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,980
W-Where?

114
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,990
What was Goku<i>-sa</i> doin' in a place like this?

115
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,190
<i>D-Don't tell me he was</i>
<i>training in his condition...</i>

116
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:55,040
<i>He's so reckless...</i>

117
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,350
<i>I'll head for Earth first thing in the morning.</i>

118
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,320
<i>I'm going to smash them</i>
<i>to pieces for sure this time.</i>

119
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,550
<i>No, before that, I'll go to Planet Namek...</i>

120
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,530
Yo, Vegeta. I heard you
had yourself a rough time of it.

121
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,700
They said that both Raditz and Nappa died.

122
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,740
To whom do the supposedly invincible
Saiyans owe the pleasure of this grief?

123
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,340
Get lost, Kewie. I don't have time to
entertain your inconsequential chitchat.

124
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,340
Now, just listen.

125
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:44,350
Freeza<i>-sama</i> is cross with you for the
actions you guys took without his permission.

126
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,590
He can't complain about it if he's not here.

127
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,690
Now,

128
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,690
remove that filthy hand of yours.

129
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:00,060
Still, Freeza<i>-sama</i> is a magnanimous
gentleman. I hear he's going to forgive you.

130
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,870
That's because you've
discovered something wonderful.

131
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,630
What?

132
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:08,640
He was thrilled when he found out he
might be able to gain eternal youth and life.

133
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,280
What did you say?! Then, the place
that Freeza<i>-sama</i> departed for is–?

134
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,280
Planet Namek.

135
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,120
<i>Damn it! He listened in on our</i>
<i>conversation over the Scouters, huh?</i>

136
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,290
<i>I-I have to beat him to it somehow,</i>
<i>or I'll be that bastard's toady forever!</i>

137
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:28,130
I understand that you wanted those
Dragon Ball things to gain eternal life too,

138
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,130
but you'll have to give that up now.

139
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:36,300
Once Freeza<i>-sama</i> has his wish granted,
he's planning to exterminate the Namekians.

140
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,300
That bastard!

141
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,370
Hey! Vegeta!

142
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,510
Vegeta<i>-sama</i>!

143
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,610
Give me that!

144
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,520
It turns out I need it after all!

145
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,390
Vegeta!

146
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,490
I won't let you do this! Those belong to me!

147
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:21,350
W-What are you doing? If you try anything
perverted, you're going to answer for it!

148
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,350
We're through playing around now.

149
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,650
Playing around?

150
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,660
Yeah.

151
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,100
That's right.

152
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,220
Sure enough, you guys...

153
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,280
...aren't Namekians!

154
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,490
That's right!

155
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,430
You're just now realizing it?

156
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,130
What?!

157
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,460
You don't mean–!

158
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,600
I-It can't be...

159
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,080
Are you sure you shouldn't be rescuing him?

160
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,650
Those are man-eating nautili.
He'll be eaten if you leave him there.

161
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,290
Gohan!

162
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,990
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

163
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:09,510
<i>What's this? This world isn't</i>
<i>Planet Namek? Then, just what is it?</i>

164
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:15,050
<i>And who is this "Freeza"</i>
<i>that even Vegeta is afraid of?</i>

165
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:21,690
<i>The situation grows more tense.</i>
<i>What fates will everyone meet?</i>

166
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,720
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

167
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,560
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

168
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,930
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

169
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,430
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

170
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,940
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

171
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,050
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

172
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,550
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

173
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,220
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

174
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:29,700
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

175
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

176
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,600
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

177
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,640
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

178
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,310
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

179
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>So sorry.</i>

180
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,620
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

181
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,630
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

182
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:14,270
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

183
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:17,940
<i>Bulma, you ain't got time</i>
<i>to waste on that goofy planet!</i>

184
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,910
<i>Man, now I'm mad!</i>

185
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,250
<i>I'll show you what happens to</i>
<i>people who make a mockery of us!</i>

186
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,980
<i>That goes for me, too!</i>

187
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,920
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

188
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,450
<i>"A Tough New Enemy!</i>
<i>Freeza, Emperor of the Universe."</i>

189
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:35,070
<i>This time, we really arrive</i>
<i>at the genuine Planet Namek.</i>

190
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,300
"Next time"
"A Tough New Enemy!
Freeza, Emperor of the Universe"
