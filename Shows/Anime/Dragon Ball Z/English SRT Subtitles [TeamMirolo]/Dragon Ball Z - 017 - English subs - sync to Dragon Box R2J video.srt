What is your mission?!

24
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:40,355
To defeat the Saiyans, and to save the Earth!

<i>"City of No Tomorrow!</i>
<i>The Long Road to Victory."</i>

26
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:08,185
It's been six months since we parted company.

27
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:10,495
It looks like you've gotten a little better.

28
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:16,155
Now then, how about
I start training you properly?

29
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,495
Come at me!

30
00:03:31,215 --> 00:03:32,375
One more time!

31
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:37,115
Over here!

32
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,655
Do not lose sight of your opponent!

33
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:43,925
I can't see anything that fast.

34
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:46,765
You don't see it. You feel it.

35
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:50,965
That's easy for you to say...

36
00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:02,505
If you've got enough time to whine,
think about what you should do instead.

37
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:04,075
Then move.

38
00:04:05,785 --> 00:04:09,175
We've only got six more months!

39
00:04:09,215 --> 00:04:12,515
When you're not eating
or sleeping, you will fight me!

40
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:15,355
Set your mind straight!

41
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:18,525
You can't mean it. I'll die.

42
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:22,355
Then get stronger! Even stronger than me! And...

43
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,835
...stronger than the Saiyans
who will be coming in six months!

44
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,575
Now, come on!

45
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:44,125
<i>The end still ain't in sight?</i>

46
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:02,155
Pretty fired up.

47
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,325
Kami<i>-sama,</i>

48
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:07,425
Just how long will it be until you train us?

49
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,335
Yeah...

50
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:16,335
We've already been here for two months,
and yet you haven't taught us anything.

51
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:20,175
We want to get stronger, like Goku.

52
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:23,415
Please give us the same
special training that you gave Goku!

53
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,415
Goku's special training, huh?

54
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:33,925
I...

55
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:36,355
...taught Goku...

56
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,695
...absolutely nothing!

57
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,175
What does he mean?!

58
00:06:47,215 --> 00:06:50,675
If that's the case, there's no reason
for us to've come all the way here at all.

59
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:54,045
It's 'zactly the same as
training down on the surface.

60
00:06:54,085 --> 00:06:58,515
Tell us, just what kind
of training did Goku do here?

61
00:06:58,555 --> 00:06:59,485
Okay?

62
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,555
We just want to get stronger.

63
00:07:04,795 --> 00:07:10,365
Getting stronger... is
knowing enemy, and knowing self.

64
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:14,565
Do that, and what you
should do come naturally.

65
00:07:16,405 --> 00:07:20,135
Knowing the enemy, and knowing oneself?

66
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,475
Enough of your smart-aleck talk!

67
00:07:22,515 --> 00:07:25,305
I know better than anyone what
my strength is! I don't need to be told!

68
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:33,155
Sure about that? You not
know self. You not know weaknesses.

69
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:36,155
What? Are you calling me weak?

70
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,595
You want to try me?!

71
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:42,455
Everyone, come.

72
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:48,495
W-What kind of room is this?

73
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:54,675
Past. Present. Future. All intersect here.

74
00:07:54,715 --> 00:08:00,345
You go on time journey now.
Goku trained here too.

75
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,445
What? Goku did?

76
00:08:04,225 --> 00:08:06,755
Intriguing. Let's go, then.

77
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:08,755
Let's go!

78
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:11,155
I ain't going.

79
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:13,395
I'll wait for ya's here.

80
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:22,305
Those want to go, enter circle.

81
00:08:26,815 --> 00:08:29,375
Close eyes slowly.

82
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:16,955
Where are we?

83
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:26,365
A tail?

84
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:27,765
It's a Saiyan.

85
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:29,205
What?

86
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,525
What happened here?

87
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:54,525
These happened during some kind of battle.

88
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:59,095
The people on this planet
appear to like fighting something fierce.

89
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,095
I'm raring to take them on.

90
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:06,705
I'm ready to have a go at them.
I'd like to try out my strength.

91
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:08,105
Come on, let's go.

92
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:15,645
All four of them together
have a battle power of 1,507.

93
00:10:15,685 --> 00:10:18,085
None of them appear
to be all that strong, huh?

94
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,285
It'll kill some time. What do
you say we rough them up?

95
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,495
There's not a single person around, is there?

96
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,665
Maybe they're scared of us.

97
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:42,175
If this really is the Saiyan's planet,

98
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,975
we definitely should not take them lightly.

99
00:10:47,385 --> 00:10:49,615
Chaozu, let's go.

100
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:50,985
Right...

101
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,665
Ten<i>-san</i>!

102
00:11:07,705 --> 00:11:08,665
Chaozu!

103
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:11,195
Ten<i>-san</i>, help!

104
00:11:19,715 --> 00:11:22,985
Ten<i>-san</i>, help!

105
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:29,425
Chaozu!

106
00:11:56,385 --> 00:11:57,945
–Chaozu!
–Chaozu!

107
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,425
Why, you–!

108
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:07,425
Okay, who's going to face us next?

109
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:09,025
I will!

110
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,395
Tenshinhan, be careful!

111
00:12:29,455 --> 00:12:32,845
Okay, now it's your turn.

112
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,915
Hold on, Tenshinhan!

113
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,165
<i>Sokidan!</i>

114
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:56,505
Get out of there, Tenshinhan!

115
00:13:02,855 --> 00:13:04,085
I got them!

116
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:12,425
That didn't hurt one bit.

117
00:13:12,465 --> 00:13:14,825
This time, all three of us will go at them!

118
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,335
It looks like we took care of them.

119
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,805
Those guys were incredible.

120
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:08,545
<i>Chaozu, I have avenged you.</i>

121
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:37,675
He vanished!

122
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,215
–Kuririn!
–Kuririn!

123
00:14:45,455 --> 00:14:48,015
These guys are invulnerable!

124
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:51,085
Where did they disappear to?!

125
00:15:01,475 --> 00:15:02,965
Kuririn!

126
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:05,945
–Kuririn!
–Kuririn!

127
00:15:08,075 --> 00:15:09,635
Let's go save him!

128
00:15:25,065 --> 00:15:26,995
–Kuririn!
–Kuririn!

129
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:40,435
Dammit!

130
00:15:40,475 --> 00:15:42,435
At this point, I'll let them
have it, even if it costs my own life!

131
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:46,445
That's it. That's more
like it. Otherwise, it's no fun.

132
00:15:46,485 --> 00:15:49,775
We've laid two of you to rest.
Who's going to be third?

133
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,185
What?!

134
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:58,125
Before you do that,
let me show you to your graves!

135
00:16:11,475 --> 00:16:13,635
This is our last chance!

136
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:25,185
<i>An extra-large Sokidan!</i>

137
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:35,415
Those guys were awful! It's
almost like they were undying monsters!

138
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:38,085
We beat them...

139
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:24,695
I-I'm alive...

140
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,835
Where are we?

141
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,895
We're alive! We're saved!

142
00:19:31,205 --> 00:19:36,435
'Course ya are! You've just
been standing there the whole while.

143
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:40,445
Your minds went on journey.

144
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:45,185
Kami<i>-sama</i> let you have
valuable experience in minds.

145
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:49,855
How'd it go with the Saiyans?

146
00:19:55,765 --> 00:19:57,255
What's wrong?

147
00:19:58,535 --> 00:20:01,535
What're ya keeping quiet for?

148
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:06,375
The Saiyans that you saw were still
only half as strong as full-fledged ones.

149
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,175
They don't even compare to the strength

150
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:14,115
that Saiyans who are
now heading for Earth possess.

151
00:20:19,055 --> 00:20:21,385
You mean, they're even stronger?

152
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:31,625
How about it? Do you
feel like running away now?

153
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,485
All right!

154
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:56,685
I'm keeping at it!

155
00:20:56,725 --> 00:20:57,925
Ten<i>-san</i>!

156
00:20:58,725 --> 00:21:00,425
I'm going at it, too!

157
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:10,765
I'm going to train here for the
next six months to defeat the Saiyans!

158
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,105
Me too!

159
00:21:31,195 --> 00:21:33,755
What's that?! Is that your defense?!

160
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:52,445
Concentrate harder!
I'm just itching to kill you!

161

<i>The Saiyans' power is terrifying.</i>

162
00:22:17,475 --> 00:22:21,065
<i>The fated time is drawing ever nearer.</i>

163
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:48,735
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

164
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:54,635
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

165
00:22:54,675 --> 00:22:57,015
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

166
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:05,515
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

167
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:11,985
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

168
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:16,055
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

169
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:19,565
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

170
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:22,235
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

171
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:29,745
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

172
00:23:31,945 --> 00:23:33,845
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

173
00:23:33,885 --> 00:23:35,675
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

174
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:39,715
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

175
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:45,385
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

176
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,555
<i>So sorry.</i>

177
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:52,665
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

178

<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

179
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,455
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

180
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,915
<i>I made it! The tail of the Serpentine Road!</i>

181
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,825
<i>This is where Kaio-sama is! Yahoo!</i>

182
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,895
<i>What's wrong with the ground here?</i>

183
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,595
<i>What are you doing?</i>

184
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:27,995
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

185
00:24:28,035 --> 00:24:33,105
<i>"Last Stop on the Serpentine Road!</i>
<i>Are You Kaio-sama?"</i>

186
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:35,875
<i>Stop picking on my father!</i>

187
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:38,345
