5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:43,430

Kame House. Hang in there, Gohan.

21
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,120
Right.

22
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,330
H-Hey, over there...

23
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,210
T-That's the direction we just came from.

24
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,710
What could it be? It's awfully bright. A star?

25
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,740
No, it doesn't appear to be a star...

26
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,730
This can't be!

27
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,760
T-This is impossible!

28
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,100
W-What is that? There's
a tremendous <i>ki</i> rising up.

29
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,700
Father's <i>ki</i> hasn't risen again, right?

30
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,100
N-No. This nasty feeling is
coming from the other one's <i>ki.</i>

31
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,100
And you know, that's an incredible
amount of <i>ki.</i> What's going on?!

32
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,760
F-Father...

33
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,940
Gohan!

34
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,520
I-I'm going back.

35
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,720
I'm going back.

36
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,890
G-Going back? You mean to where Goku is?

37
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:43,900
I can tell... Father is in trouble.
He's going to die if this keeps up...

38
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,730
What are you talking about, Gohan?

39
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,070
There's no way Goku–
your father is going to die, is there?

40
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,940
Besides, even if we go back there,

41
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,070
we can't do anything against
a guy with a <i>ki</i> that incredible.

42
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,240
Yeah, I know.

43
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,750
Even so...

44
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,780
Even so!

45
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,690
I absolutely have to go back there!

46
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:09,160
Hey!

47
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,150
Wait up, Gohan!

48
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,310
How about it, Kakarrot?

49
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,980
You're finished now!

50
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,160
What's going on?!

51
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,540
A Great Ape? A Great Ape monster?

52
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,080
Let me give you some good news.

53
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,120
A Saiyan who has become a Great
Ape has ten times more battle power!

54
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,100
Goku, there's a great ape monster
that comes out during the full moon.

55
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:28,270
You must not go outside. As long
as you stay asleep, you'll be safe.

56
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,710
I-I'll make it so that tail
of yours never grows back.

57
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,110
It's something of a nuisance.

58
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,750
<i>S-So that's it! I finally get it!</i>

59
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,230
H-How awful...

60
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,130
The monster that crushed Grandpa to death...

61
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,070
...and the monster that showed
up at the tournament grounds,

62
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,070
and busted everything up...

63
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,310
...that was me?!

64
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,120
<i>I'm sorry, Grandpa. This guy is incredible.</i>

65
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,290
<i>I'll probably have to use up all of</i>
<i>my ki, or I won't be able to beat him.</i>

66
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,770
<i>Once I die, and go back over to</i>
<i>the Next World, I'll go apologize to you.</i>

67
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,510
What is that monster?!

68
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,280
I-It's outrageously huge!

69
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,320
That monster's clothes're the
same as the Saiyan's! Is he that Saiyan?!

70
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,930
I'll show you, Vegeta!

71
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,170
I'm going to feed you your fill
of me and the Earth's <i>Genki Dama</i>!

72
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,310
You're at last going to use
the <i>Genki Dama</i>, are you?

73
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,140
Still, with your body as ragged as it is,

74
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,980
this is going to put
too much of a burden on it.

75
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,340
<i>K-Kaio-ken!</i>

76
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,890
What's the matter?

77
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,570
Can't you even get away?

78
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,760
Die!

79
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,310
What is it?

80
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,050
Is anything appearing?

81
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,060
I'm starting to see some light.
Goku's <i>ki</i> has subsided.

82
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,120
Goku<i>-sa</i> has won, right?

83
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,630
–Goku!
–Son<i>-kun</i>!

84
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,630
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

85
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,630
I-Is he dead?

86
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,140
No, he is not dead.

87
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:54,570
What the hell has happened?

88
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,940
I-Impossible!

89
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,410
You mean the Saiyan has
transformed, even without the moon?!

90
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,620
It's hopeless now! There's no
way he can stand up to that monster!

91
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,720
What about Gohan<i>-chan</i>?!
What's Gohan<i>-chan</i> doin'?!

92
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,320
Where's Gohan<i>-chan</i>?!

93
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,340
There's someone else there...

94
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,240
It's Yajirobe!

95
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,980
What is he doing?!

96
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,980
Come on, Yajirobe! Why
aren't you helping Son<i>-kun</i>?!

97
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,180
Hey!

98
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,490
G-Gohan<i>-chan...</i>

99
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,830
Chichi!

100
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,730
<i>Father!</i>

101
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,140
<i>Goku, he's your son, all right.</i>

102
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,990
What's the matter, Kakarrot?
Can't you manage anything?!

103
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,720
H-He's so fast for as big as he is!

104
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,690
I don't have enough time to mentally
focus so I can create a <i>Genki Dama</i>!

105
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,900
And even if I went to a times five <i>Kaio-ken,</i>
it wouldn't be any use against him!

106
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,300
Hmph. If you're not going to
come at me, then I'm coming after you!

107
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:34,940
I-I just need ten seconds!
I need some time to concentrate!

108
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,970
T-That's it!

109
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,740
Tenshinhan, I'm going
to borrow your technique!

110
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,620
<i>Taiyo-ken!</i>

111
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,800
Now, while his eyes are blinded by the glare!

112
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,000
M-My eyes! My eyes!

113
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,820
All right... At this distance...

114
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,790
T-The Land...

115
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,400
the Seas...

116
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,400
and...

117
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,400
all living things...

118
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,640
Each of you, share with me just
a little bit of your <i>Genki</i> energy!

119
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,820
<i>I beg you!</i>

120
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,820
Dammit, that was an insolent stunt!

121
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,730
<i>J-Just a little longer...</i>

122
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,830
<i>Just a little more, and</i>
<i>I can form a Genki Dama...</i>

123
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,840
<i>W-What's he doin'?</i>

124
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,800
<i>He's starting to get his sight back.</i>

125
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,170
<i>Still, at this distance,</i>

126
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,610
<i>I'll be able to launch the</i>
<i>Genki Dama before he can attack.</i>

127
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,580
Dammit!

128
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,980
Where are you?!

129
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,780
Where are you?! Where did you go?!

130
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,820
It's useless to run away from
me! I can sense your presence!

131
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,790
Dammit!

132
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,620
<i>I've gathered the Genki energy together.</i>

133
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,420
Why, you!

134
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,830
<i>He found me! Please,</i>
<i>let there be enough time!</i>

135
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:10,010
I-It's done. I've collected the
<i>Genki</i> energy from all earthlings.

136
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,830
All right!

137
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,390
Take this!

138
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,380
W-What was that?

139
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,650
What happened?

140
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,400
I-I never expected him to attack like that...
T-That was an awful miscalculation.

141
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,040
What a development... The <i>Genki Dama</i>
I worked so hard to make has vanished...

142
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,580
Hmph, you're a tough bastard.

143
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:50,990
But you appear to be
near your limit. I can tell.

144
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:56,950
H-He's got me. There ain't
no way even I can win now.

145
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,430
I used up most of my
<i>ki</i> on that <i>Genki Dama.</i>

146
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,450
Now what are you going to do?!

147
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,440
Goku's <i>ki</i> is shrinking fast!

148
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,310
F-Father!

149
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,650
Hurry! We're almost there!

150
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,870
Whoops! Sorry, sorry!

151
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,370
Looks like I carelessly
stepped on you and crushed your leg.

152
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,010
Well, this time, I'll
carelessly crush your heart.

153
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,620
This is the end for you, Kakarrot!

154
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,320
Even if you were to come back to life
again, this planet won't be here when you do!

155
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,390
D-Damn... I'm utterly defeated...

156
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,330
I never imagined there'd be
this much difference in our power...

157
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,640
I'm glad there was
someone so strong... but if I die...

158
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,200
it'd be so frustrating...

159
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,210
Die!

160
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,630
That's what you call the weasel's last fart...

161
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:28,610
Now, I ain't even got enough
strength left to blow my nose...

162
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,050
D-Do as you like...

163
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,620
W-Why, you...!

164
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,720
Kakarrot!

165
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,000
How dare you... how dare you scar my face?!

166
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:06,010
I'm going to squeeze you to death!

167
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,960
<i>Having been wounded,</i>
<i>Vegeta was burning with anger.</i>

168
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,840
<i>Will Goku be crushed to death like this?</i>

169
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,650
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

170
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:54,530
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

171
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,900
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

172
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:05,400
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

173
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,880
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

174
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,980
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

175
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,480
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

176
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,150
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

177
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

178
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,730
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

179
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,570
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

180
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,640
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

181
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,310
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

182
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>So sorry.</i>

183
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,580
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

184
00:23:55,290 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

185
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,700
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

186
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:18,540
<i>Gohan, your daddy's whole body</i>
<i>is a mess. I can't move anymore.</i>

187
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,510
<i>Fight in my place.</i>

188
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:24,220
<i>What's the matter? Isn't a</i>
<i>Super Saiyan supposed to be strong?</i>

189
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,050
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

190
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,850
<i>"Don't Die, Father!!</i>
<i>This is the Depth of Gohan's Power."</i>

191
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,270
<i>I can't, Father! He's too</i>
<i>strong! I can't beat him!</i>

192
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:38,170
"Next time"
"Don't Die, Father!!
This is the Depth of Gohan's Power"
