<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,390
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,110
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,740
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,040
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,750
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:57,380
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,260

<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,680
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,690
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,700
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,700
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,080
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,250
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,090
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,920
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,180
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:58,190
<i>Madoshi Babidi conspires to</i>
<i>gather the greatest energy in the world,</i>

24
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,990
<i>and revive a sealed-up Majin Boo.</i>

25
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,910
<i>To return Kuririn and Piccolo,</i>
<i>who had been turned to stone,</i>

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,990
<i>back to normal, Goku and</i>
<i>the others enter the spaceship.</i>

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,420
<i>In order to proceed to the command</i>
<i>center, where Babidi and Dabura are,</i>

28
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,170
<i>they must defeat the opponents</i>
<i>that appear at each of various Stages.</i>

29
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,970
Papparapa!

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:46,070
<i>Vegeta easily beats Puipui,</i>
<i>breaking through Stage 1.</i>

31
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,580
I-I can't believe it.

32
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,790
Is this Super Saiyan thing really that strong?

33
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:02,840
<i>Now, at the second Stage, the</i>
<i>space beast Maju Yakon appears!</i>

34
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,360
<i>"Goku's Power Wide Open!!</i>
<i>Blow Away Yakon."</i>

35
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,760
That's an unusual guy that's come out, huh?

36
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,680
Which one of you should I devour first?

37
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:38,890
I'm gonna be your opponent.

38
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,060
You're huge, but somehow, you
ain't too smart-looking, are you?

39
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,070
C-Could this be Y-Yakon... Maju Yakon?

40
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,400
Maju Yakon?

41
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,200
Yes. He's incredibly strong,

42
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,410
one of the fearsome
demon beasts of the universe!

43
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,910
G-Goku-<i>san</i>, single-handedly, you couldn't...

44
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,210
Yakon! Take their energy from them!

45
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:10,760
Hurry and revive Majin Boo for me!

46
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,260
That was close!

47
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,810
He's enormous, yet still so agile!

48
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,820
Which is why I spoke earlier!
Let us all fight him!

49
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,450
Ah, no. I think everything will
be all right with Father by himself!

50
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,280
I-It couldn't be!

51
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:25,210
You've fled well. But that
won't happen this time!

52
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,670
What a surprise! You can
shoot those sickle-like claws out?

53
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,930
He's jittery, he's jittery!

54
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,180
This will be an easy
victory for Yakon, indeed!

55
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:44,310
Let's shake him up even more,
and end this fight all at once!

56
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,850
Good, Yakon!

57
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,350
Yakon, as impressive as ever!

58
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,110
You can kill all three of
them, except for Kaioshin!

59
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,360
Take in your fill of energy!

60
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,280
This will ensure the return of Majin Boo!

61
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,450
In order for you to
finish this battle quickly,

62
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,290
I'm taking you to your beloved
pitch-black world of darkness,

63
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:10,210
Planet Ankoku!

64
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,300
Babidi-<i>sama</i>, even without
sending them to Planet Ankoku,

65
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,840
Yakon will be sufficiently victorious.

66
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,050
I suppose.

67
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,350
However, if they fight inside the spaceship,

68
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,850
and supply any strong shock to it,

69
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,850
Majin Boo might emerge
with his power only partly intact.

70
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,230
If we're going to do this at all,

71
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,730
we want him at his
original strength, don't we?

72
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,240
Quite so.

73
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:41,280
Well, shall we go for it?

74
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,670
Papparapa!

75
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,910
What, it's a rock?

76
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:33,380
Hey now, I can't see a thing!
This really is completely dark!

77
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,880
What a fix...

78
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,760
This is my cherished Planet Ankoku.

79
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:55,320
I can see quite well!
You're scratching your head, right?

80
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,320
Huh?

81
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,320
Planet Ankoku?

82
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,110
Y-Yakon's home planet.

83
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,160
It is far out in space,
where sunlight cannot reach it,

84
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,120
and so it is always completely dark!

85
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,410
You're mine!

86
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,710
One down...!

87
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,050
Where are you?!

88
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:30,350
Right here!

89
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,170
C-Can you tell what is going on?

90
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,080
Yeah, more or less.

91
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,200
Can you see?

92
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,530
You're taking us too lightly!

93
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,830
I may not be able to see with my eyes,
but I can still understand your motions.

94
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,370
Through subtle changes
in air current and so on.

95
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,790
Besides which, there are
many different ways to see you.

96
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,300
For instance...

97
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:01,570
What's this?! What's going on?
He's different than he was before!

98
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,570
Oh, he is merely glowing.

99
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,740
Say, bring me an energy meter!
The most powerful meter there!

100
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,120
Right!

101
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,220
Now it's bright. That's Father for you.

102
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,430
How's that? Now you understand, right?

103
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,770
It doesn't matter to me how dark it gets!

104
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:46,610
I see. I know now that the
darkness is of no use to me.

105
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,490
What, you don't seem at all nervous...

106
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,610
Babidi-<i>sama</i>!

107
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,790
T-Three thousand kili?

108
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,800
H-How does an Earthling have
an energy of three thousand kili?!

109
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,470
Three thousand kili...

110
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,640
With only two or three hundred kili,
one could destroy a planet or two...

111
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,810
Most peculiar. There is no reason
mankind such as this should exist on Earth.

112
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,270
Maybe the meter is malfunctioning?

113
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,480
However, supposing it
really is three thousand kili,

114
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:24,690
Yakon cannot win against him!

115
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,530
Yakon's energy is only
eight hundred kili, after all!

116
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,770
How long are they going
to make us wait, anyway?

117
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:03,360
I wonder how long it will
be before they start again.

118
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,020
What's going on?

119
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,530
"Food"

120
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,360
Delicious!

121
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,120
So good!

122
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,800
–Another serving!
–Another serving!

123
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,850
I'm full, I'm full!

124
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,560
That was good!

125
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,610
Trunks-<i>kun</i>, excuse me,
but would you pay for this?

126
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,570
Oh... I don't have any money!

127
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,740
But Trunks-<i>kun,</i>

128
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,240
what about your prize money from
winning the Tournament Junior Division?

129
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,080
I still haven't gotten it!

130
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,580
They said I would get it when
everything's over, after an awards ceremony.

131
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,790
What should we do?

132
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,780
Y-You there!

133
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,150
Yikes, they found us.

134
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:35,240
Run!

135
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,780
Meal thieves!

136
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,790
Owie, owie, owie!

137
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:46,120
Hey, there...

138
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,920
Goten-<i>chan</i>, so this is where you've been!

139
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,840
Hold it!

140
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,760
Pay up!

141
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,010
Uh, these people will pay you! So long!

142
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,740
Victory is mine.

143
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,680
Wh-What's this?!

144
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:17,720
Huh? It's gone back to
complete darkness again!

145
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,930
Wrong! He's been turned from
a Super Saiyan back to normal.

146
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,180
Tasty!

147
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,730
I've never eaten light so delicious
and with such volume before!

148
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,110
You eat it?

149
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,570
M-Maju Yakon eats the energy of light!

150
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,660
Goku-<i>san</i>, your energy as a Super
Saiyan is undoubtedly his greatest food!

151
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,210
Father, you can't turn
Super Saiyan any more!

152
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,380
Apparently that guy eats the energy of light!

153
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,800
That's right! That was
the best light just now!

154
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,510
If it were possible, I wish
you could treat me yet again!

155
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,220
You're a strange one!

156
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,570
Fine! I will treat you some more!

157
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,410
What?

158
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,910
Here goes!

159
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,950
What is he thinking?

160
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,450
Father! I'll fight too!

161
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:33,460
With the two of us, we can win
without turning Super Saiyan!

162
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,340
Nah, I'll do this by myself.
You stay out of it.

163
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,970
Yea! I'm so happy you're
so stupid! I will feast again!

164
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:49,680
I-It really is stupid!

165
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,980
Wh-Why is he being so
particular about fighting by himself?

166
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,480
This is not a game!

167
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,610
Be quiet and let him do this!

168
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:02,530
Kakarrot has some kind of idea. He's no fool.

169
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm being sucked in!
You expect me to give in?!

170
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,130
Yakon, you fool!

171
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,340
What am I supposed to do
with you sucking up all his energy?

172
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,130
What a waste!

173
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,970
Unless the energy is taken
from him by inflicting damage,

174
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:31,390
Majin Boo can't absorb it, you know!

175
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,120
I-Incredible!

176
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,080
Father, you did it!

177
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,960
So that's it...

178
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,880
Wha–?!

179
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,500
Impossible!

180
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,890
It's open, it's open!

181
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,900
We can go on to the floor below!

182
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,350
Right!

183
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,070
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, hurry up!

184
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:23,460
H-He exploded! Yakon!
How come he exploded?

185
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,920
He was a fool.

186
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,920
It appears he played
right into the enemy's hands.

187
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,930
He ate more light energy
than he could contain.

188
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,470
No! It was weird there!

189
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:42,190
At the last moment,
Yakon puffed up all of a sudden...

190
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,190
That was awesome, Father!

191
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,110
That incredible <i>ki</i>, right
when you defeated that monster!

192
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,150
Yeah, I guess.

193
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:52,450
<i>So, that rotten Kakarrot has</i>
<i>indeed overcome the wall as well...</i>

194
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,700
<i>The Super Saiyan wall...</i>

195
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,950
<i>during those seven years he</i>
<i>trained in the Other World...</i>

196
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,000
These aren't your ordinary guys after all!

197
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,130
It is well. As you wish,

198
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:10,130
I will quench your uneasiness, Babidi-<i>sama.</i>

199
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,850
I will go to Stage 3 for you!

200
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:21,140
There, in short time,

201
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:26,020
I will fill Majin Boo's ball
with their energy at any cost.

202
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,900
D-Dabura! If you are beaten, then it's all over!

203
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,160
You're sure you have a chance of winning?

204
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,700
Chance of winning?

205
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,040
I am Dabura, King of the Demon Realm!

206
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,040
Come three thousand kili,
come four thousand kili,

207
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:48,050
there does not exist a man in all
the world with greater power than I!

208
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:53,010
<i>In the second Stage, Goku also</i>
<i>easily beats down Maju Yakon.</i>

209
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:58,060
<i>Does the word "pinch"not</i>
<i>appear in Goku's dictionary?</i>

210
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,890
So, I wonder what kind of
guy will come out this time.

211
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,900
Gohan, it's your turn now!

212
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,100
Right!

213
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,740
<i>However, Dabura, King of</i>
<i>the Demon Realm of Darkness,</i>

214
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,750
<i>is to appear next!</i>

215
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:24,460
<i>Also, it's finally Gohan's turn...</i>

216
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,800
All right, I'll stick it to 'em!

217
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,510
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

218
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:44,100
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

219
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:54,650
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

220
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:00,790
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

221
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:07,790
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

222
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:13,170
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

223
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,010
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

224
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:26,100
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

225
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,650
<i>Even now?</i>

226
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:35,280
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

227
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,660
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

228
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:47,170
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

229
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:57,170
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

230
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,110
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

231
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,280
<i>What's happening at the Tenkaichi</i>
<i>Tournament while we're off fighting?</i>

232
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,450
<i>I'll put on a show as</i>
<i>I defeat that masked goon,</i>

233
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,490
<i>then gently force the</i>
<i>delicate lady out of the ring.</i>

234
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,250
<i>The spectators will find it mesmerizing!</i>

235
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,160
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

236
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,830
<i>"A Great Miscalculation!!</i>
<i>Satan vs. Three Super-Warriors!?"</i>

237
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,670
<i>It doesn't look like Satan-san</i>
<i>realizes how strong his opponents are.</i>

238
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,300
"Next time"
"A Great Miscalculation!!
Satan vs. Three Super-Warriors!?"
