18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,690
Get down!

00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,370
P-Please...!

20
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,680
Save me...!

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,850
You dare ask anything for yourself?!

22
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:23,720
How many people have you killed
as they begged for their lives like that?!

23
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,160
Please...!

24
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,690
Freeza!

25
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:40,340
I've shared a little bit of my <i>ki</i> with you.

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,670
Knowing you, you should be
able to move, even in your shape.

27
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,710
The rest is up to you!

28
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:57,160
<i>"Freeza Defeated!! A Single</i>
<i>Blast Packed with a Totality of Rage."</i>

29
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,500
This is quite unexpected.

30
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,670
T-That you should share your
energy with me, you monkey scumbag!

31
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,670
You can survive in the
vacuum of space, right?

32
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,640
So hurry up and leave this planet!

33
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,180
Survive, and come to
understand the blessing that life is!

34
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,040
T-Thank you.

35
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,720
Hey! Wait up!

36
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,650
–You think you can touch me?
–You can't reach!

37
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:39,180
Come down from there!

38
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:55,340
It seems the end of my life has nearly arrived.

39
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:02,720
G-Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

40
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,020
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>! Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

41
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,020
B-Bring... bring everyone together.

42
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,550
R-Right!

43
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,200
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

44
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,370
It would appear the time for me
to take my leave of you has come.

45
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:38,040
I am pleased to be able
to fulfill my life's span.

46
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,360
Muri<i>-sama</i>!

47
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,360
Oh, how did it go?

48
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,230
Yes! As feared, we were unable to
locate those from Elder Tsuno's village.

49
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,300
What in the world could
have happened to them?

50
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,980
Those guys are probably the ones
from the village that I wiped out.

51
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,980
The wish to the Dragon Balls

52
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,680
was to bring back to life everyone
killed by Freeza and his men, right?

53
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,860
I'm neither Freeza nor one of
his men. Quite the blunder, huh?

54
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:58,370
Apparently the Dragon Balls
followed after, and have reached us.

55
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,700
G-Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

56
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:15,210
As I said earlier, virtually
none of my life's measure remains.

57
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,680
M-Muri...

58
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,020
Y-Yes?

59
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,990
H-Hold out your hand.

60
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,690
Right!

61
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,000
F-From now on, you are to be the Grand Elder.

62
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,710
In due time, the Dragon Balls will
regain their brilliance once again.

63
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,680
U-Use the Dragon Balls well.

64
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,020
Y-Yes, we will.

65
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,390
I-I'm counting on you...

66
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,690
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

67
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:12,000
Let there be eternal
peace among the Namekians.

68
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,670
–Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!
–Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

69
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,370
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>!

70
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,410
Grand Elder<i>-sama...</i>!

71
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,730
Grand Elder<i>-sama...</i>!

72
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,230
G-Grand Elder<i>-sama...</i>

73
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,400
This is amazing...

74
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,640
You possess such incredible latent ability!

75
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,980
Are you really an Earthling?

76
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,680
Excuse me! Can I please have you hurry?

77
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:31,210
Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>, may you rest in peace.

78
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,660
N-Now I understand clearly!

79
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,360
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, you have
merged with Nail<i>-san</i>, right?

80
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,830
Everybody!

81
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,200
The Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> is no longer here.

82
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,840
Let the rest of us put our
remaining energies together,

83
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,010
and find ourselves eternal peace!

84
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,350
Grand Elder<i>-san</i> is dead and all,
and Kuririn cannot come back.

85
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,550
Yeah.

86
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:12,020
Since people who have been resurrected
once by the Dragon Balls cannot return again.

87
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,520
It's all right!

88
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,660
The Dragon Balls of Namek can
resurrect people any number of times!

89
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,000
It's likely, so long as it isn't a natural
death, it can be done infinitely many times.

90
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,000
Then... then...!

91
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,670
When the day comes that your
Dragon Balls can again grant wishes, Dende,

92
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,370
Kuririn<i>-san</i> and Chaozu<i>-san</i>
and everyone can come back to life!

93
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,510
Father! Be sure to come back!

94
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,550
Let's call Kuririn<i>-san</i> and the others
back together with the Namek Dragon Balls!

95
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,170
Planet Namek here is just
moments away from exploding.

96
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,370
Where are you thinking of going?

97
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:15,350
No matter how you may struggle, you
can't survive in the emptiness of space!

98
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,290
Death is all that is waiting for you!

99
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,830
There's no time before the explosion!

100
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,900
You cannot get to your spaceship in time!

101
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,530
And Vegeta has wrecked
the spaceship I came in!

102
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,680
Saiyans really are monkey scum after all!

103
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,480
You cannot depart this planet!

104
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,820
You will perish, together with this planet!

105
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,650
Isn't it ironic?

106
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,860
You, who won in battle,
will die, while I will be spared!

107
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:40,370
T-That's because you do such impudent things
as share your energy with me, Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

108
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,540
I will live too. You'll see.

109
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,850
I'm stopping.

110
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,190
W-What was that?!

111
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,560
What do you mean, you're stopping?!

112
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,860
There ain't any reason to kill you,
now that you've started trembling.

113
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,700
You should go on living with the shock
you have undergone here, in tranquility.

114
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,870
M-Monkey scumbag!

115
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,500
So you're Freeza?

116
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,870
You're much more of a runt than I'd imagined.

117
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,840
So there's still another one of you scum left?

118
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,840
Fifty percent power, he says...

119
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,220
Whether those words are a
bluff, or whether they ain't,

120
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:04,390
all I can do is stake everything
on a times twenty <i>Kaio-ken</i>!

121
00:14:55,210 --> 00:15:00,910
<i>T-That was a close one! H-How?!</i>

122
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,390
<i>How does that lower life form</i>
<i>Saiyan have such awesome power?</i>

123
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,050
<i>This is the first time anyone has</i>
<i>done this much harm to my body!</i>

124
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,030
You damn Saiyan!

125
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,870
That one...

126
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,380
...hurt.

127
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,730
It hurt!!

128
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,380
I-I'll just take this and...

129
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,880
I-I'll just take this and...

130
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:02,900
H-He took that huge <i>Genki Dama</i>
head-on, and yet he's still alive!

131
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,910
I-It can't be!

132
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,250
Goku!!

133
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,990
Y-You're going to pay for that...

134
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,190
How dare you... How dare you?!

135
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,870
How dare you...?!

136
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,030
What?!

137
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:54,040
Dammit!

138
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,550
I'm stopping.

139
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,890
W-What was that?!

140
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:07,560
What do you mean, you're stopping?!

141
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,860
In reaction to your using
your 100 percent power,

142
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,860
you've passed your peak,
and your <i>ki</i> is falling rapidly.

143
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,530
I've begun to think that it's
useless to fight you any further.

144
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:22,540
I'm already feeling satisfied,
and your sense of pride is in tatters!

145
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,010
After all, someone has come
forward and surpassed you,

146
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,840
when no one in this world was
supposed to have been able to.

147
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,510
And what's more, that someone...

148
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,040
...was a mere Saiyan!

149
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,190
There ain't any reason to kill you,
now that you've started trembling.

150
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:42,890
You should go on living with the shock
you have undergone here, in tranquility.

151
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,740
I-I'm the greatest in the universe!

152
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,410
I am Freeza, Emperor of the Universe!

153
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,480
And so, you...

154
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,150
...you monkey scum...

155
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,360
You must die at my hand!!

156
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,200
<i>You...</i>

157
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,210
must be...

158
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,380
killed by me!!

159
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,350
You stupid bastard!!

160
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:15,180
<i>Goku was completely</i>
<i>victorious in his battle with Freeza.</i>

161
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,380
<i>However, Planet Namek is</i>
<i>already moments from exploding!</i>

162
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,910
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

163
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:54,720
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

164
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,090
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

165
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,620
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

166
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:12,130
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

167
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:16,240
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

168
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,740
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

169
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,380
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

170
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,890
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

171
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,990
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

172
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,790
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

173
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,830
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

174
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:45,500
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

175
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,670
<i>So sorry.</i>

176
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,810
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

177
00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:00,820
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

178
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,000
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

179
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,730
<i>I-It's going to explode...</i>
<i>Planet Namek is going to explode...!</i>

180
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:20,870
<i>I ain't gonna be able to</i>
<i>get back to Earth! Damn it!</i>

181
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:24,310
<i>Freeza's spaceship, the last</i>
<i>thing we were depending on,</i>

182
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,380
<i>cannot fly at all now.</i>
<i>Son Goku is going to die!</i>

183
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,240
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

184
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,510
<i>"Planet Namek's Great Explosion!!</i>
<i>Goku Disappears into Space."</i>

185
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:36,360
<i>F-Father!!</i>

186
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,520
"Next time"
