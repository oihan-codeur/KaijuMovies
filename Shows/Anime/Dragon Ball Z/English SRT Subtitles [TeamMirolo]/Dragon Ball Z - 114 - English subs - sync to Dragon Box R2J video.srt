00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:17,475
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:24,785
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,055
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,745
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,785 --> 00:01:04,755
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,795 --> 00:01:08,225
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,735
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,775 --> 00:01:26,685
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:30,255
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:37,125
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:38,095 --> 00:02:42,925
Go to Shinsenkai. Can spread
Ultra Holy Water to whole world.

17
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,975
You may have obtained the Ultra Holy Water,

18
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:00,875
but you are out of time!

19
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:43,055
<i>Piccolo and the others saved Kami,</i>

20
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:48,425
<i>and managed to obtain the Ultra</i>
<i>Holy Water from Garlic Jr. However...</i>

21
00:03:50,765 --> 00:03:56,675
<i>"A Battle of Extreme Measures!!</i>
<i>Kami-sama Breaks the Covenant."</i>

22
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:33,865
Those two as well...

23
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:43,275
Now then, to show off
our true power to the fullest!

24
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:24,585
Gohan! Kuririn!

25
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,045
Before you worry about others,

26
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:30,555
you ought to be concerned about yourself!

27
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:59,075
You were the former Kami<i>-sama</i>!

28
00:07:59,115 --> 00:08:00,745
What?!

29
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:15,455
Mister Popo can tell.
Feel familiar. No doubt about it.

30
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:43,455
Please wait! It is I, the one to
whom you yielded the Throne of Kami!

31
00:08:48,165 --> 00:08:54,695
I am aware a being such as I is
unworthy to come to this place.

32
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,095
However,

33
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,095
due to our situation...

34
00:08:58,135 --> 00:08:59,695
Look out, Kami<i>-sama</i>!

35
00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:08,805
Former Kami<i>-sama</i>, something
terrible is happening down on Earth!

36
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:12,655
We must take this Ultra Holy Water
to the bottom of the Heavenly Realm!

37
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:19,825
Look out, Kami<i>-sama</i>!

38
00:09:28,765 --> 00:09:30,435
Mister Popo!

39
00:09:33,445 --> 00:09:35,865
Mister Popo not bothered by this.

40
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:42,335
But Kami<i>-sama</i>, this no good.
He not let us pass no matter what.

41
00:10:03,775 --> 00:10:05,735
Mister Popo, let's go!

42
00:10:05,775 --> 00:10:09,735
Quickly, Mister Popo! There is no time!

43
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:18,415
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

44
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,765
Too slow!

45
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:49,405
Hurry, Mister Popo!

46
00:10:49,445 --> 00:10:51,415
Kami<i>-sama</i>, so spunky!

47
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:26,615
Finished so soon?

48
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:33,985
Come on. Hey!

49
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:38,295
What's the matter? Get up!

50
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:51,205
You unresponsive wimp!

51
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,855
K-Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

52
00:12:03,755 --> 00:12:05,085
You're not getting away!

53
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:22,235
<i>Kuririn-san!</i>

54
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,055
Impossible!

55
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,085
H-He's a freak!

56
00:13:20,605 --> 00:13:22,095
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

57
00:13:55,165 --> 00:14:00,105
Our powers are far too unlike, yours and mine.

58
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,915
<i>I guess it was something of a mistake for me...</i>

59
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:22,155
<i>...to let Kami die by defeating this one.</i>

60
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,095
<i>The Dragon Balls will disappear,</i>

61
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:27,695
<i>and I will be unable to</i>
<i>wish my father back to life.</i>

62
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:30,665
<i>But it's no matter.</i>

63
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:33,695
<i>In time I will think of another way.</i>

64
00:14:47,855 --> 00:14:50,985
<i>Son Goku's son, huh?</i>

65
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:55,925
<i>Looks like he was too much</i>
<i>for the others to handle after all.</i>

66
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:03,895
What a shame! You just
missed your mentor, Piccolo,

67
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,425
leaving for the Other World.

68
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:14,075
Not to worry. You'll meet again soon. In Hell!

69
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,255
You make me laugh.

70
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:37,165
To think you would be so
proud of that level of power.

71
00:15:37,205 --> 00:15:42,505
Perhaps you think becoming a
giant has given you greater strength.

72
00:15:42,545 --> 00:15:46,835
In order to truly... become a giant,

73
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,715
you have to do this!

74
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:58,655
<i>What?!</i>

75
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:11,505
<i>I-Incredible! Piccolo-san!</i>

76
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:21,575
Your larger scale certainly
bestows its own kind of power-up.

77
00:16:21,615 --> 00:16:24,815
However, in exchange, you
lose some of your edge on speed.

78
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,445
There's no longer any way you can win!

79
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,565
Popo, this is a dead end.

80
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,605
Mister Popo forgot.

81
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:49,805
Shinsenkai laid out in several sections.

82
00:16:49,845 --> 00:16:53,175
Need former Kami's permission go further.

83
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:09,525
Kami<i>-sama</i>, all over!
Get hit again, Kami<i>-sama</i> die!

84
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:12,055
It is nothing.

85
00:17:17,235 --> 00:17:18,865
Let's go, Mister Popo!

86
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,035
Kami<i>-sama</i>, incredible!

87
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:36,885
What's matter, Kami<i>-sama</i>?

88
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,215
Suddenly, it's hard to breathe...

89
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:41,925
Kami<i>-sama</i>! Y-Your hand!

90
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:49,395
I-Is this a precursor to
having my spirit drawn from me?

91
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:55,905
Kami<i>-sama</i>, must go back. Body
not last until reach hole of currents.

92
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:58,875
After coming this far,
I can't just turn around now...

93
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:00,345
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

94
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:14,955
<i>What?!</i>

95
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,365
P-Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

96
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:28,265
What's wrong? You're already tired out?

97
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:37,775
You appear to have
forgotten that I have eternal life.

98
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:11,175
What happened to all that
energy you had a moment ago?

99
00:19:15,985 --> 00:19:20,255
<i>I cannot allow myself to expire in this place!</i>

100
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:47,615
Kami<i>-sama</i>! There's another wall!

101
00:19:50,285 --> 00:19:52,345
Kami<i>-sama</i>, wait!

102
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,865
Hang in there, Popo.

103
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:04,735
K-Kami<i>-sama</i>, your body...

104
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:12,535
I know...

105
00:20:21,925 --> 00:20:23,485
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

106
00:20:23,525 --> 00:20:27,355
Piccolo and Kami share
the same mind and body...

107
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:31,495
In the Shinsenkai, Kami is about
to have his spirit pulled from him...

108
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:33,155
And so, Piccolo is also...

109
00:20:33,195 --> 00:20:34,755
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

110
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:40,435
Between you and Kami, which
of you will be the first to die?

111
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:45,175
Over there!

112
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:46,375
Is that it?

113
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:11,765
This is where it ends, Piccolo!

114
00:21:57,455 --> 00:22:02,245
<i>At last, Kami-sama reaches</i>
<i>the bottom of the Heavenly Realm.</i>

115
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:06,695
<i>However, his life has all but expired.</i>

116
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:13,225
<i>And how does Gohan</i>
<i>plan to challenge Garlic Jr.,</i>

117
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,925
<i>who has obtained eternal life?</i>

118
00:22:44,635 --> 00:22:48,625
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

119
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:54,465
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

120
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,845
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

121
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:05,345
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

122
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:11,855
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

123
00:23:11,895 --> 00:23:15,955
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

124
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:19,455
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

125
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:22,095
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

126
00:23:23,805 --> 00:23:29,575
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

127
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,705
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

128
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,505
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

129
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:39,545
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

130
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:45,215
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

131
00:23:45,255 --> 00:23:47,385
<i>So sorry.</i>

132
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:52,525
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

133
00:23:55,265 --> 00:24:00,535
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

134
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:14,015
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

135
00:24:14,055 --> 00:24:16,385
<i>Hang in there, Kami-sama! You're almost there!</i>

136
00:24:16,425 --> 00:24:18,355
<i>You'll be able to return everyone</i>
<i>to normal with the Ultra Holy Water!</i>

137
00:24:18,395 --> 00:24:21,385
<i>I'm not about to let you ruin my schemes!</i>

138
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:23,425
<i>I'm not letting any of you out of here alive!</i>

139
00:24:23,465 --> 00:24:26,255
<i>I'll suck up the Heavenly Realm,</i>
<i>and everything in it!</i>

140
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:28,365
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

141

<i>"The Ultra Holy Water Worked!!</i>
<i>The World Awakens from Its Nightmare."</i>

142

143
00:24:35,315 --> 00:24:38,245
"Next time"
"The Ultra Holy Water Worked!!
