5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:40,305
<i>C-Curses! This was all a terrible</i>
<i>miscalculation, especially for me.</i>

17
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:42,665
<i>All that remains is for me to go back...</i>

18
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:44,705
<i>...to the laboratory.</i>

19
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:54,415
W-Who is that guy down there?

20
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:58,315
He is who you were fighting with, isn't he?

21
00:02:58,355 --> 00:02:59,795
What?!

22
00:03:02,565 --> 00:03:05,625
Y-You mean it's not him?!

23
00:03:05,665 --> 00:03:08,625
<i>Are there even more Artificial Humans?</i>

24
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:13,865
<i>History is greatly different</i>
<i>from that of Trunks' future.</i>

<i>"Give Chase!! The Search for</i>
<i>Doctor Gero's Mysterious Laboratory."</i>

26
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:40,165

27
00:03:40,205 --> 00:03:41,495
<i>What?!</i>

28
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:43,365
I-It can't be!

29
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:58,685
Who's been carvin' up the earth down there?

30
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,515
Look, over there, over there!
That's where everyone is!

31
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:06,485
That's them, right?
That's Son<i>-kun</i> and the others!

32
00:04:06,525 --> 00:04:09,555
S-Stop, you idiot!
You seriously wanna go there?

33
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:11,025
It's all right, I tell you!

34
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:14,595
If everyone's still alive,
that surely means it's all over!

35
00:04:14,635 --> 00:04:19,605
You take us any closer, an' I'll
drop this rugrat right outta here!

36
00:04:19,645 --> 00:04:22,265
Oh? Be my guest.

37
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:26,445
Or didn't I mention that his father is Vegeta?

38
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:30,415
V-Vegeta?

39
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:32,045
This rugrat–er, rather,

40
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:35,455
this handsome young man's the
child of yourself and Vegeta<i>-sama</i>, is he?

41
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,955
That case, let's go!

42
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:39,385
Now you're talking!

43
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:42,385
Different? He's different, you say?

44
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:45,835
Well then, who is that guy? Tell me what he is!

45
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:53,965
It's no great matter, is it?

46
00:04:54,005 --> 00:04:55,965
After all, our history may
have just changed slightly...

47
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,445
...from the one he told us about.

48
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:05,375
The Artificial Humans we're facing
have also changed from the ones he knew.

49
00:05:05,415 --> 00:05:07,185
That's fine if it's true.

50
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:13,825
<i>Now then, what should I do?</i>

51
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,055
<i>How can I get back to the laboratory?</i>

52
00:05:16,095 --> 00:05:19,395
<i>If I try to fly away, I'll likely be overtaken.</i>

53
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:23,425
<i>The only thing I can do is use</i>
<i>this terrain to conceal myself as I go.</i>

54
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:30,435
Hey, isn't that Bulma<i>-san</i>'s?

55
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:36,845
Yoo hoo!

56
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,015
Hey, look! That's an Artificial
Human! One of em's still 'round.

57
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:46,185
Doctor Gero?

58
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:48,855
Watch out! Don't come any closer!

59
00:05:50,035 --> 00:05:51,655
Now!

60
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:56,335
I wasn't lying when I said there's
absolutely no way you could win!

61
00:05:56,375 --> 00:06:00,805
No. 17 and No. 18 will be
coming soon to kill you all!

62
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:02,005
No. 17?

63
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,405
No. 18?

64
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:41,435
Why, that lousy...

65
00:07:06,075 --> 00:07:08,405
Ah, what a surprise!

66
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:09,875
Trunks!

67
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,875
Oh, Trunks!

68
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:18,645
Oh, thank goodness! Thanks, pal.

69
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:30,355
He's vanished, dammit!

70
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:32,665
He got away!

71
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,035
Bulma<i>-san</i>!

72
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,035
Are you okay?

73
00:07:42,075 --> 00:07:45,405
Fine, fine! This boy saved me.

74
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:48,075
–Really!
–Thank goodness.

75
00:07:50,455 --> 00:07:54,445
Damn! You're not getting away from me!

76
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:06,895
Why didn't you help them just now?

77
00:08:06,935 --> 00:08:07,725
What?

78
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:11,095
They are your wife and child, aren't they?

79
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:15,435
How insignificant. I have
no interest in any of that.

80
00:08:21,515 --> 00:08:24,215
You're in the way, mind your own business!

81
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:35,985
<i>He's not flying up in the air,</i>

82
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:39,865
<i>which means he's running away</i>
<i>on foot so that we can't locate him.</i>

83
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:48,305
<i>He couldn't have gotten very far yet.</i>

84
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:57,645
Say, was that strange old
geezer earlier an Artificial Human?

85
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:00,315
There, there!

86
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:02,485
Why, yes he was.

87
00:09:02,525 --> 00:09:04,355
There, there!

88
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:10,155
That was probably Doctor Gero himself.

89
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:16,695
I've seen him in a book of scientists.

90
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,135
That is strange, huh?

91
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:23,505
I wonder if he's converted himself?

92
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:25,375
There, there!

93
00:09:29,515 --> 00:09:32,215
<i>Ain't no one gonna pay me no attention?</i>

94
00:09:32,255 --> 00:09:37,715
Hey! That Artificial Human just
now was probably Doctor Gero!

95
00:09:37,755 --> 00:09:39,695
Doctor Gero?!

96
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:52,535
That was Doctor Gero?!

97
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:54,205
What's that supposed to mean?

98
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:56,605
Like I said, I've seen his picture before.

99
00:09:56,645 --> 00:10:00,445
He spoke of Doctor Gero, so I looked him up.

100
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:34,705
There, there, now...

101
00:10:34,745 --> 00:10:37,145
Yes, he is pulling a scary face, isn't he?

102
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:38,715
You know what?

103
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:43,715
Doctor Gero was quite gifted and famous,
especially among other scientists.

104
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:46,085
It seemed he was rather
hard to get along with though.

105
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,115
Oh, there, there!

106
00:10:52,365 --> 00:10:56,665
Everything you've told us
has been completely false!

107
00:10:56,705 --> 00:11:00,765
Wasn't Doctor Gero supposed to
have been killed by Artificial Humans?!

108
00:11:00,805 --> 00:11:03,675
And these Artificial Humans
were different from yours!

109
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:15,085
T-The only thing I can figure is that
history itself has shifted somehow.

110
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:19,285
Most likely due to me coming
back to the past before now.

111
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:22,285
He mentioned No. 17 and No. 18, right?

112
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:25,125
More than likely, those are
your two Artificial Humans.

113
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:28,695
Tell us how we can distinguish them!

114
00:11:28,735 --> 00:11:30,695
We can't afford any more mistakes.

115
00:11:30,735 --> 00:11:33,005
Yes, you're right.

116
00:11:52,095 --> 00:11:56,695
No. 17 is a young man with long
black hair and a scarf around his neck.

117
00:11:56,735 --> 00:12:01,795
No. 18 is a pretty female type,
dressed in clothes similar to mine...

118
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,695
F-Female type?!

119
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:08,865
They both have cold eyes and round earrings.

120
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:10,835
I think you'll know them when you see them.

121
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,705
They would have to draw energy in
through their palms, wouldn't they?

122
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:17,715
No, they aren't like that.

123
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:21,815
Their energy is... unlimited.

124
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:25,625
Unlimited? You mean it never runs out?

125
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:32,285
There, there!

126
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:37,065
Say, more importantly, where is Son Goku<i>-san</i>?

127
00:12:37,105 --> 00:12:40,065
That heart disease, the
one you warned us about?

128
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:42,705
He just barely came down with it.

129
00:12:45,745 --> 00:12:49,735
Is that how badly time has been shifted?

130
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,515
Goku<i>-sa</i>! Hang in there!

131
00:12:57,555 --> 00:13:01,625
You don't suppose... we might be
too late with the medicine, do you?

132
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:04,095
You've got to hold on, Goku!

133
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:12,335
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

134
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:23,875
<i>You just wait, Vegeta and Piccolo!</i>

135
00:13:23,915 --> 00:13:28,915
<i>You're about to get a taste of just how</i>
<i>terrible we Artificial Humans really are!</i>

136
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,485
What do you think you're doing, Vegeta?!

137
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:37,895
If you come any closer
with that scary face of yours,

138
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:40,695
you're going to make Trunks cry again!

139
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:45,165
There, there now...

140
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:49,005
I know, it's surprising
how scary his face is, isn't it?

141
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:52,675
Bulma, do you know where
Doctor Gero's laboratory is located?

142
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:55,475
He's heading back that way for sure!

143
00:13:55,515 --> 00:13:56,675
The location?

144
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:04,685
Well, as I recall, it was somewhere in
the mountains surrounding Metro North.

145
00:14:04,725 --> 00:14:07,695
There's a rumor that he converted
a cave up there into a laboratory.

146
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:13,355
Well, he's long gone by now.

147
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:15,365
Even if we were to take off after him...

148
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:19,995
We're all right. Did anyone see him flying away?

149
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:23,365
Now that you mention it...

150
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,175
He intends to use the topography
here to help him get away again.

151
00:14:27,215 --> 00:14:29,675
He must still be running
through an area not far from here.

152
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:32,275
I get you. All we have to
do then is get there first,

153
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:39,485
and then destroy No. 17 and No. 18 before
Doctor Gero has a chance to activate them.

154
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:42,085
I wouldn't do such a cowardly thing.

155
00:14:43,935 --> 00:14:47,695
I just want to be first in line to put
the others away with my own two hands!

156
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:51,695
The Artificial Humans we just took
on gave us such a poor fight, after all.

157
00:14:51,735 --> 00:14:54,005
You must not!

158
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,235
You must not.

159
00:14:55,275 --> 00:14:58,405
You underestimate the Artificial Humans.

160
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:03,245
As Piccolo<i>-san</i> said, we should
destroy them before they are started up.

161
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:15,525
If we're too late to do that,

162
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:19,355
we should avoid battle until Son
Goku<i>-san</i> has recovered from his illness.

163
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:22,695
We don't need to wait for Kakarrot's strength!

164
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:23,865
Can't you tell?

165
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,695
I've become a Super Saiyan too!

166
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:28,105
With both him and I turned Super Saiyans,

167
00:15:28,145 --> 00:15:32,075
my elite skills obviously
place me several steps above him!

168
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:33,945
Now move it, you're in my way!

169
00:15:46,755 --> 00:15:49,255
Hey, he's gone all right.

170
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,625
Vegeta has become a Super Saiyan,

171
00:15:51,665 --> 00:15:55,895
and has gotten even stronger than Son Goku.

172
00:15:55,935 --> 00:16:00,765
He just might be able to beat
the Artificial Humans, as he says.

173
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:04,705
I can turn into a Super Saiyan as well.

174
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:08,075
However, there isn't any way
I could match up against them.

175
00:16:08,115 --> 00:16:10,915
They have unbelievable strength! I'm going too.

176
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:14,755
He may be a jerk, but I'm not
going to let my father die again!

177
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:31,695
Father? Did he just say father?

178
00:16:34,345 --> 00:16:35,665
I wonder what he meant?

179
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:38,305
There's no reason to keep this secret any longer.

180
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,935
His name is Trunks.

181
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:42,945
His father was Vegeta, and you are his mother.

182
00:16:42,985 --> 00:16:46,685
In other words, he's the grown-up
version of the baby in your arms.

183
00:16:51,725 --> 00:16:53,525
You're kidding!

184
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:58,695
I-Is that right?

185
00:17:01,535 --> 00:17:04,695
C-Come to think of it, they do look alike.

186
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:06,965
N-Now it all makes sense,

187
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:11,535
about how he is able to be a Super Saiyan.

188
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:19,675
You guys come with me and help
search out Doctor Gero's laboratory.

189
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:26,355
It seems best to destroy the Artificial
Humans before they get started up.

190
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,385
–You got it.
–Ok!

191
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:40,505
Trunks, you grow up to be
a pretty good guy after all!

192
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:41,705
Thank goodness!

193
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:45,705
Your mom was worried because
you have such a mean look about you!

194
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:51,515
B-Bulma<i>-san</i>, please let my
father know about all of this.

195
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:54,515
And tell him if he gets well in
time, we'd like him to join us.

196
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:57,685
That's fine, but how am I supposed to tell him?

197
00:17:57,725 --> 00:17:59,755
My airplane got all smashed up.

198
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:02,325
Gohan, you take her with you.

199
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:04,695
The rest of us have what it takes...

200
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:06,755
...if we're just destroying the Artificial Humans.

201
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,495
Okay. But be careful.

202
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:13,705
All right, let's go! We have
to find it before Vegeta does!

203
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:21,405
Okay, we'll be going pretty fast, now.

204
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:24,615
Be careful, we have a baby here too.

205
00:18:25,215 --> 00:18:28,555
Hey, don't forget 'bout me!

206
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:35,225
Yer takin' me too, yer takin' me.

207
00:18:38,235 --> 00:18:39,725
<i>I should be okay now.</i>

208
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:43,135
<i>Having run this far, I should</i>
<i>be able to fly without being seen.</i>

209
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:54,745
<i>Vegeta!</i>

210
00:18:58,015 --> 00:19:01,745
<i>Shoot! Is he still trying to search me out?</i>

211
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:13,695
<i>Him too. They're both flying in</i>
<i>exactly the same direction as I'm headed...</i>

212
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,495
<i>Could they possibly be headed for my laboratory?</i>

213
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:19,135
<i>No, it's just a coincidence.</i>

214
00:19:22,205 --> 00:19:23,835
<i>It has to be a coincidence!</i>

215
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:27,775
<i>There's no way they could</i>
<i>know where my laboratory is.</i>

216
00:19:27,815 --> 00:19:31,115
<i>Only a very few scientists even know about it.</i>

217
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:35,685
<i>Was that Bulma?</i>

218
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:38,485
<i>The first daughter of the Capsule Corporation?</i>

219
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:42,125
<i>She might have asked her father about me!</i>

220
00:19:50,835 --> 00:19:52,665
<i>T-That must be it, all right!</i>

221
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:55,805
<i>They're all headed toward my laboratory.</i>

222
00:19:55,845 --> 00:20:03,105
<i>So, they intend to destroy No. 17 and</i>
<i>No. 18 before I can start them up, do they?</i>

223
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:05,745
<i>There's no way I'm letting</i>
<i>them get away with that!</i>

224
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,045
<i>I never told anyone the exact location,</i>

225
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:12,055
<i>so they shouldn't be able to</i>
<i>find it without some searching.</i>

226
00:20:12,095 --> 00:20:15,085
<i>I can still take the roundabout</i>
<i>way and get there first.</i>

227
00:20:22,535 --> 00:20:26,695
Say, Gohan<i>-kun</i>, you can
speed up a little if you want.

228
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:28,105
Right!

229
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,955
Your late father?

230
00:20:51,365 --> 00:20:54,225
He sure did a lot of wicked things.

231
00:20:54,265 --> 00:20:57,705
He'd be in Hell now, no doubt about it.

232
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:05,335
But he had his good points too.

233
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,705
He was always so full of pride,

234
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:09,715
he'd never show his
gentle side clearly to anyone...

235
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:13,885
But I knew...

236
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:26,125
Is he thinking of
accompanying me the whole way?

237
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:27,995
How interesting!

238
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:46,975
<i>That's right, he can become a Super Saiyan too.</i>

239
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:51,425
<i>He is my kid, which explains</i>
<i>where he gets his Saiyan blood from.</i>

240
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:15,005
Yajirobe! Why don't you
get down and walk already?

241
00:22:15,045 --> 00:22:16,675
Stuff it!

242
00:22:18,715 --> 00:22:23,085
<i>The warriors head toward</i>
<i>Doctor Gero's laboratory.</i>

243
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:26,685
<i>However, what is it that awaits them there?</i>

244
00:22:44,645 --> 00:22:48,645
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

245
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:54,485
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

246
00:22:54,525 --> 00:22:56,855
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

247
00:23:00,325 --> 00:23:05,355
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

248
00:23:07,665 --> 00:23:11,865
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

249
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:15,965
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

250
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:19,475
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

251
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:22,105
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

252
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:29,615
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

253
00:23:31,855 --> 00:23:33,715
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

254
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:35,525
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

255
00:23:35,565 --> 00:23:39,555
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

256
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:45,235
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

257
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:47,405
<i>So sorry.</i>

258
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:52,535
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

259
00:23:55,285 --> 00:24:00,545
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

260
00:24:12,235 --> 00:24:14,365
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

261
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:17,935
<i>Trunks, are those the Artificial</i>
<i>Humans you were talking about?</i>

262
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:19,935
<i>There ain't no mistake this time, right?</i>

263
00:24:19,975 --> 00:24:22,965
<i>None of you know how truly terrifying they are.</i>

264
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,935
<i>We should definitely destroy</i>
<i>them before they are started up.</i>

265
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,045
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

266
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:32,775
<i>"And the Terror Becomes Reality...</i>
<i>No. 17 and No. 18 Awaken."</i>

267
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:35,955
<i>Oh, no! They've been started up already!</i>

268
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:38,225
"Next time"
"And the Terror Becomes Reality...
No. 17 and No. 18 Awaken"
