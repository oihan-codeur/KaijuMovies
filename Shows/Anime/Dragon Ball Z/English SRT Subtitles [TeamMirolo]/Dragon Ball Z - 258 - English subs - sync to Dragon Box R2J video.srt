Pardon me, Piccolo-<i>san</i>, but
is it possible you think I'm losing?

66

I don't want to think so, but given the difference
in your strengths, it cannot be avoided.

Oh, is that right? What kind
of scheme do you have going?

74
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:13,065
See, at first, I was going
to get ridiculously beat up,

75
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:15,065
and at the last moment,
turn the tables on him, right?

76
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:17,935
That's the most exhilarating
pattern of winning there is, isn't it?

77
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:21,735
As long as I'm at this, I'd like for
them to say it was an incredible battle!

78
00:09:23,485 --> 00:09:25,235
Stop thinking about that trivial stuff

power right from the start!

Geez! You don't understand the
aesthetics of fighting at all, huh?

There's no need for you to have kept
me in the dark about your little ruse!

What if they lose to Boo, and
Piccolo destroys the doorway?

89
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:26,175
Neither Trunks nor Goten-<i>kun</i> will
ever come out of that room again!

90

Th-That's why, once we bring them
back to life with the Dragon Balls...

91
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:35,935
So, are you saying to them that
once they lose, they have to die?

92
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:38,975
Is it okay for Kami-<i>sama</i> to say such a thing?!

93
00:10:39,855 --> 00:10:43,855
When a person dies, it's
incredibly painful for us, you know!

98
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:36,415
That's enough! You're weak!

99
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,205
This is no fun. I'll kill you!

100
00:11:41,245 --> 00:11:45,215
What did you say? Talk big to me, will you?!

101
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:48,965
You don't get how fearsome I am at all, do you?

102
00:11:55,265 --> 00:12:00,185
You'll be sorry! Now
you've made me seriously angry!

103
00:12:07,105 --> 00:12:11,445

H-He just might win!

108
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:40,535
I'm putting all of this to an
end–the playing around, that is!

109
00:13:51,835 --> 00:13:53,005
Here I go!

110
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:01,225
Which technique should
I start concluding this with?

111
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:07,935
There's that one, and this one...
I thought so many of them up...

112
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:15,025
What are you doing?! Hurry up and decide!

113
00:14:15,065 --> 00:14:22,245
Okay, I've decided! But he might
die with just one blow... Oh, well...

114
00:14:24,915 --> 00:14:28,085
Take this! <i>Galactica Donuts</i>!!

118
00:16:16,525 --> 00:16:17,735
Just kidding.

119

W-Well, I thought it would come to this...!

121

Just you going isn't fair!
It's my turn now for sure!

You dummy!

Gotenks!

125
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,065
He got me...

126
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:38,375
It wasn't me!

127
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:48,805
Out of the way, now!

128
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:52,225
You're giving me no latitude, huh Piccolo-<i>san</i>?

129

Why, you...!!

130

Get carried away, will you?
All right, in that case...!

131

Ow-ow-ow-ow!

Ha! Ha ha-a! Serves you right!

Take this, and be gone from this world!

136
00:20:57,765 --> 00:21:01,395

W-What's that?

140
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:58,195

<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

150
