<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,830
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,140
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,840
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,450
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:52,320
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,830
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:04,840
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,310
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,380
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,820
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:26,730
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:30,330
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,200
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,110
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,450
<i>Even against Goku and Piccolo,</i>
<i>the strongest combo in the world,</i>

17
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,300
<i>the strength of Raditz was overwhelming!</i>

18
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,780
<i>And so, unable to do anything,</i>
<i>Goku was faced with a crisis.</i>

19
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,150
<i>However, at that moment...</i>

20
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:50,950
<i>"Goku Dies!</i>
<i>There's Only One Last Chance."</i>

21
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,350
W-What is this?!

22
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,490
I-It's Son Goku's boy...

23
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,760
I-Impossible!

24
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,830
G-Gohan!

25
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,350
R-Run, Gohan!

26
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,320
Run away!

27
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,320
B-Battle power...

28
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,770
O-One thousand...
one thousand three hundred seven?!

29
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,140
Stop picking on...

30
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,170
...my father!

31
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,710
G-Gohan?

32
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,110
Father?

33
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,610
Did you–?

34
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,220
Father...

35
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,760
Y-You little brat!

36
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,630
R-Run!

37
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,660
Gohan, run away!

38
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,730
Run away! Quickly!

39
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,010
N-Now his battle power is a mere one?

40
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,850
It changed suddenly,
along with his emotions.

41
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,780
Father...

42
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,260
Run!

43
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:25,430
Gohan!

44
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,170
S-Stop! Please stop! He's–

45
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,080
–still just a child? Is that
what you were going to say?

46
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:43,180
You've got to be joking! That brat has
a battle power far higher than you two!

47
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,620
I'm going to kill him now, while he's
still incapable of adeptly using his power.

48
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,120
Don't worry. You'll see
him again soon enough!

49
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
In the Other World, that is.

50
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,900
Wait!

51
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,090
<i>You're the first one who has</i>
<i>inflicted this much damage on me.</i>

52
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:21,330
<i>But this is the end of the line for you.</i>

53
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,930
W-Why, you!

54
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,280
You still have this much power left?!

55
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,880
Piccolo!

56
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:52,180
Hurry! Do that technique from earlier!

57
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,030
I've been getting it ready, just in case!

58
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,900
But it's still going to take...
a little bit more time!

59
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,070
Why didn't you grab his tail?!

60
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,210
If he decided to, he could
cut off his tail on his own!

61
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,080
Y-You knew about that?

62
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,190
Piccolo! Hurry!

63
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,890
Hurry it up, please!

64
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,240
<i>Damn! Thanks to the blow that kid</i>
<i>landed on me... my power has dropped!</i>

65
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,770
L-Let me go, Kakarrot! You idiot!

66
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,970
You're going to get it too,
clinging to me like this!

67
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,940
I'm going to die together with you!

68
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,810
Y-You're what?!

69
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,710
Are you out of your mind?!

70
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,120
This is the only way
there is to defeat you!

71
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,590
Son Goku!

72
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,130
I'm not going to hesitate here.

73
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:13,040
If I can wipe you out as well,
nothing could be better for me!

74
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,740
<i>But then again,</i>

75
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,340
<i>your friends will probably just bring</i>
<i>you back to life with the Dragon Balls.</i>

76
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,290
Piccolo... still not yet?
My ribs are broken!

77
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,990
H-Hurry!

78
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,840
O-One thousand
four hundred eighty-five?!

79
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,090
L-Let me go! I was in the wrong!
I-I'll never come to this planet again!

80
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,850
Y-You think you can fool me again?

81
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,790
It's no lie! Don't you believe the
word of your own older brother?!

82
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,100
Piccolo! Hurry and do it!

83
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Are you ready for this?!

84
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,710
Do it!

85
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,350
W-Wait!

86
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,350
<i>Makankosappo!</i>

87
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,120
Stop!

88
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,260
D-Damn it to hell!

89
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:17,180
Damn... To think that I...
would be done in... by these guys!

90
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,380
T-Take that!

91
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,530
W-Who would have
thought... that Kakarrot...

92
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,560
...w-would even lay
down... his own life...

93
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,100
You idiot...

94
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,510
Son Goku can come
back to life right away.

95
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,110
W-What?!

96
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:47,510
We have these nice things called
Dragon Balls here on this planet.

97
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,950
By asking of them, any desire
one may have can become possible.

98
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,520
Bringing the dead
back to life, for example.

99
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,050
Damn it all...

100
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,030
Still, you've told me something good...

101
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,900
The entire situation up until now...

102
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:17,210
has been communicated to
m-my two pals, deep in space.

103
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,210
What?

104
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,190
They know that I've been done in...

105
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,680
...and they will be sure to come here...

106
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:32,060
...to handle not only you...

107
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,030
...but to completely mop up...

108
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,940
...e-every last person on this
planet, in the blink of an eye.

109
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,340
And while they're at it...

110
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,610
maybe they'll use those
whatever-you-called-them things...

111
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:52,540
and have me brought back to life.

112
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,950
T-Those...

113
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,550
...other two...

114
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,220
...when will they get here?

115
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,320
One year... just one year from now...

116
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:15,200
One year? Two more of
you... who are even stronger?

117
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,610
Your chances of winning will be
absolutely zero that time for sure...

118
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,020
Enjoy yourselves as much
as you can for the next year...

119
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,950
It was a short-lived joy, wasn't it?

120
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:44,960
You guys are no more
than worms, after all...

121
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,890
<i>Right now, Goku-sa and the others must</i>
<i>be havin' a good time at the Kame House.</i>

122
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,890
<i>I wonder if Gohan is</i>
<i>adjustin' okay to them...</i>

123
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,620
<i>Still, he'll be okay.</i>

124
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,330
<i>That boy's got good manners.</i>

125
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,870
I wish I had gone, too...

126
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,970
Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

127
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,080
Pa!

128
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,440
Chichi, where's Gohan<i>-chan</i>?

129
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,180
Hey, Gohan<i>-chan</i>!

130
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,210
I brung you a whole mess of presents–!

131
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,220
Pa!

132
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,370
I think it was around here somewhere.

133
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,180
You're out of your misery now.

134
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,220
You just had to go and spit out
all of that uncalled-for blather.

135
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,960
Son Goku, he's dead.

136
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,070
There's somebody there!

137
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,880
Some of them are down!

138
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,610
T-The only one standing is...

139
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,050
...Piccolo!

140
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,930
W-What the hell?

141
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,390
<i>At that same time,</i>
<i>a great distance away in space...</i>

142
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,150
That miserable Raditz...

143
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,110
He's dead.

144
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,120
He's pathetic! I mean, really...

145
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,490
...for him to be killed by someone

146
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:57,520
with a battle power of
just a bit more than a thousand!

147
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,930
What should we do? Put this
planet on hold and go there?

148
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,600
They mentioned something...
interesting, didn't they?

149
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,930
"Dragon... balls," or something.

150
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:12,470
Yeah. It sounds like
they can grant any wish.

151
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,640
All right then, let's go.

152
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,810
We're going to bring
Raditz back to life, right?

153
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,550
Don't make jokes! We don't need
that good-for-nothing any more.

154
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,790
We won't ever grow any older,

155
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,660
but instead have eternal youth.
How does that sound?

156
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,190
If that were so, we
could enjoy fighting forever!

157
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,200
I get you. That would be great!

158
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,400
That's how it happened.

159
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,000
I-I see...

160
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,870
Goku! Goku, I say!

161
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,850
Hey, Goku! Stay with us!

162
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,890
Gohan<i>-kun</i> is fine.
He's just unconscious.

163
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,650
Thank...

164
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,020
goodness...

165
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,160
He's coming around.

166
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,390
Goku...

167
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:12,200
Chichi won't... chew me out...

168
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,070
Son<i>-kun...</i>

169
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,580
K– uririn...

170
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:31,920
...this dying stuff...
it's pretty... n-nasty, ain't it?

171
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,920
Y-You might say that.

172
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,220
W-What are you saying,
Goku?! D-Don't give up!

173
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,890
This isn't like you!

174
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,760
Goku!

175
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,770
T-This time...
it doesn't look... so good for me...

176
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,800
D-Don't worry! We'll bring
you back to life right away!

177
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,410
I'm... counting... on it...

178
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:09,220
Goku...

179
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:18,030
Goku!

180
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:38,020
Everything else aside,
Kakarrot's son's battle power...

181
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,190
...was unusually high,
compared to Saiyan children.

182
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,490
It could have been some
kind of mistake, couldn't it?

183
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,790
No, there's no mistake.

184
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:54,330
Raditz did actually take a great
deal of damage from that kid's strike.

185
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,840
Apparently, when our blood
is mixed with an Earthling's,

186
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,940
it results in a hybrid with mighty power.

187
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,920
Hmph, a Super Saiyan, you mean?

188
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,520
I get it. If we were to produce
those guys one after another,

189
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,930
then once again, Saiyan
rule will no longer be a dream.

190
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,330
You've got to be kidding.

191
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,900
Just watch those guys grow and gain
even greater power for themselves.

192
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:28,930
Then it will be <i>our</i>
positions that are in danger.

193
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,140
That would be true.

194
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,540
In any case,

195
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,540
we will exterminate everyone on Earth.

196
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,880
Three days should be enough for that.

197
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,890
Until then, let's have ourselves a good,
long sleep for the first time in a while.

198
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,920
Yeah! I'll look forward
to seeing you in a year!

199
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,980
Goku!

200
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,690
Goku...

201
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:26,420
Son<i>-kun</i>! I can't stand you dying!

202
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,730
Goku!

203
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,100
He vanished!

204
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,610
I get it. This is Kami's doing.

205
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,510
This is something he would be capable of.

206
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,310
That bastard.

207
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,080
He's thinking of using Son Goku
again for some nonsense or other.

208
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,150
Some nonsense?

209
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:04,930
<i>How does Kami-sama</i>
<i>intend to use Son Goku?</i>

210
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,930
<i>Now that Goku is no longer here to rely on,</i>

211
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,470
<i>is there any means left</i>
<i>of defending the Earth?</i>

212
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,990
<i>The mighty Saiyans</i>
<i>arrive on Earth in one year!</i>

213
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,870
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

214
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:53,740
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

215
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:56,120
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

216
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:04,620
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

217
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:11,090
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

218
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,200
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

219
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,700
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

220
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,370
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

221
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,880
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

222
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,950
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

223
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,790
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

224
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,860
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

225
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,530
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

226
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:46,700
<i>So sorry.</i>

227
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,800
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

228
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:59,780
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

229
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,690
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

230
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,290
<i>I've ended up traveling across the Next World,</i>

231
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,960
<i>to train with someone named Kaio-sama.</i>

232
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,430
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

233
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,730
<i>Your son is just starting a hard</i>
<i>journey down in the Lower Realm.</i>

234
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,300
<i>Yeah, together with Piccolo.</i>

235
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,240
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

236
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,040
<i>"Even Yama-sama is Surprised –</i>
<i>The Fight Continues in the Next World."</i>

237
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,150
<i>Father, I'm scared of Uncle Piccolo!</i>

238
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,490
"Next time"
