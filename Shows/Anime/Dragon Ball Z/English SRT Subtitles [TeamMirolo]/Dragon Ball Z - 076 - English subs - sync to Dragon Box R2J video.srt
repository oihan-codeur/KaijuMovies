<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:52,245
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

15
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:10,135 --> 00:02:13,095
<i>At last, Super Shen Long appears!</i>

17
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:20,105
<i>However, burning with rage, Freeza</i>

18
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:23,805
<i>Hurry up, Kuririn and Gohan!</i>

19
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:34,315
<i>"Kami-sama Also Returns to Life!</i>
<i>Piccolo Is Resurrected by Super Shen Long."</i>

20
00:02:48,165 --> 00:02:50,095
He-He's huge!

21
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:53,505
His form is different
than the one on Earth as well.

22
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:57,435
Thi-This is Shen... Long?

23
00:02:57,475 --> 00:03:03,615
Thou who hast gathered the
Dragon Balls, now speak forth thy wish.

24
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:10,555
I shall grant thee any three wishes,
whichsoever art within mine ability.

25
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:14,055
Awesome! He really does grant three wishes!

26
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:15,885
We should have expected as
much from the home soil's Shen Long!

27
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:16,825
It sure is generous of him!

28
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:19,895
What should we do? We have three wishes.

29
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:23,065
Your wishes, quickly! Don't
forget about Freeza and Vegeta!

30
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,765
Oh yeah.

31
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:32,575
First, ask him to please bring back to
life everyone the Saiyans killed on Earth.

32
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:35,445
All right, I got it!

33
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:53,495
That wish cannot be granted.

34
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:59,565
Restoring the dead to life canst only
be accomplished one individual at a time.

35
00:03:59,605 --> 00:04:01,435
Oh no!

36
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:12,075
Apparently, he can only
bring back one person at a time.

37
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:14,085
Only one at a time?!

38
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,755
If they only have three wishes,

39
00:04:16,795 --> 00:04:20,425
and there's me, Yamucha, Chaozu, and Piccolo...

40
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:23,095
All right! I'll have
myself restored to life first.

41
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:24,455
What was that?

42
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:27,595
Well, Kaio<i>-sama</i>, I'll go first–

43
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:31,595
Wait! Don't be so selfish, I'm going first!

44
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:32,935
What are you saying?!

45
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,805
I was the first one of us to die!

46
00:04:34,845 --> 00:04:36,575
Therefore, I will be the first brought back!

47
00:04:36,615 --> 00:04:38,275
That's choplogic!

48
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:40,405
Everyone! Let's draw straws!

49
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:43,575
No way! You'll use your
telekinesis to cheat on us!

50
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:46,615
How awful! I wouldn't do that!

51
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,485
Let me...

52
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,985
Let me talk with Gohan!

53
00:04:55,025 --> 00:04:56,995
–What?
–Please!

54
00:04:57,035 --> 00:05:00,925
What keeps thee? Speak forth thy wish.

55
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:05,595
I shall grant thee any three wishes,
whichsoever art within my ability.

56
00:05:05,635 --> 00:05:08,605
Within his ability, he says.

57
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:12,605
Quickly! If we're found out by
Freeza or Vegeta, we're finished!

58
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,075
What do we do? Only one
person can be brought back per wish!

59
00:05:17,115 --> 00:05:20,585
This is quite a fix. Who do we choose?

60
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:25,785
Shoot! For the home soil's Shen Long,
he's not that generous after all!

61
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:34,095
You say you want to speak with Goku's son?

62
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:36,595
What are you planning to do, Piccolo?

63
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:39,605
Why you! What are you thinking of doing?!

64
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:43,105
You're not thinking of having
just yourself brought back, are you?!

65
00:05:43,145 --> 00:05:45,105
What?! Is that right?

66
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,135
Piccolo, that's not fair!

67
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,615
You're not the only one
who's been training here!

68
00:05:50,655 --> 00:05:53,515
We've also powered up several
levels, you know. What's more–

69
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,985
Hurry and let me speak, please!

70
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:06,935
All right, then. Place your hand on
my shoulder, and then you can speak.

71
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,765
Gohan! Can you hear me?! It's me! It's Piccolo!

72
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:16,275
Gohan!

73
00:06:19,615 --> 00:06:23,075
Answer me, Gohan! It's me! Piccolo!

74
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:25,575
Piccolo? It can't be!

75
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,615
Where are you, Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

76
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:33,085
I'm using Kaio to speak
directly into your hearts.

77
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,255
I won't have you dishonor my name.

78
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,125
Kaio<i>-sama</i> is how I am addressed, Kaio<i>-sama.</i>

79
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,295
Into... our hearts?

80
00:06:43,105 --> 00:06:45,235
We know that you have three wishes,

81
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:50,005
but that only one person can
be brought back to life per wish.

82
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:51,505
Now listen closely!

83
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:55,505
With the first wish, bring me back to life!

84
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:56,075
Wait!

85
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,015
We won't let you get away with this, Piccolo!

86
00:06:58,055 --> 00:06:59,955
You shut up!

87
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:06,085
Don't forget, if I am returned
to life, Kami will be also.

88
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:09,585
When that happens, the Dragon Balls
on Earth will also be restored,

89
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:12,295
and the rest of us here
can then be brought back.

90
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,595
Hey, yeah! We can do it that way!

91
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,095
Understood, Piccolo<i>-san.</i>

92
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:20,605
I get it now. So that's what you were after.

93
00:07:20,645 --> 00:07:23,275
–Nice thinking!
–Piccolo is great!

94
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:26,645
Now, I'll tell you the second wish...

95
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,745
Once I... Once I'm brought back to life,

96
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:33,585
bring me to Planet Namek,
where you guys are!

97
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,585
I... I want to fight.

98
00:07:36,625 --> 00:07:41,985
I want to fight that rotten
Freeza, who's killed my people,

99
00:07:42,025 --> 00:07:44,095
in the homeland from which I was born.

100
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:47,125
What are you saying, Piccolo?!

101
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,595
I've gained great power since I've been here.

102
00:07:51,635 --> 00:07:54,005
I'll defeat him for you for sure!

103
00:07:54,045 --> 00:07:57,505
Send me there to that
planet you're on. Got it?

104
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:59,605
Understood, Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

105
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,945
I'm counting on you. Do whatever
you want with the third wish.

106
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:07,815
Right! I'll be so happy once you get here!

107
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,415
Hey, Piccolo!

108
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:14,585
Have you forgotten the
promise you made to me?

109
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,325
That you would never fight against Freeza?

110
00:08:17,365 --> 00:08:20,595
I must have. I don't remember
making such a promise.

111
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,095
What's that?

112
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:26,435
Unfortunately, my memory isn't that great.

113
00:08:26,475 --> 00:08:29,105
–Why you!
–Hold it now...

114
00:08:29,145 --> 00:08:31,105
–Kaio<i>-sama</i>!
–Just take it easy!

115
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:34,605
Let go of me! How dare you do this to me!

116
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:36,275
<i>I don't know what kind of punk you are,</i>

117
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:40,115
<i>but I, Piccolo-sama, will be sure to defeat you!</i>

118
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:43,955
You guys! You have no
idea how terrible Freeza is!

119
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:47,125
Let go of me! I can't talk to you like this!

120
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:48,555
Okay!

121
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,995
Before we do anything else,
let's get those two wishes granted!

122
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:53,495
–Right!
–Dende!

123
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:54,395
Yes?

124
00:08:54,435 --> 00:08:58,995
Ask that Piccolo, the Namekian who
was on Earth, be brought back to life!

125
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:02,775
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, you say? Got it.

126
00:09:07,115 --> 00:09:10,275
<i>Any second now, Piccolo-san...</i>

127
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:27,595
What's this? Something's headed this way!

128
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:30,465
It's an incredible battle power!

129
00:09:31,435 --> 00:09:33,735
F-Freeza!

130
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:45,075
<i>It will still take several more</i>
<i>minutes for Kakarrot to fully recover.</i>

131
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:49,115
<i>It's still a bad time for Freeza to appear.</i>

132
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:54,455
Ah, crap. I got a bad feeling about this.

133
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:59,025
What?

134
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,525
What is going on here? It's night!

135
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:04,535
Why?

136
00:10:04,575 --> 00:10:06,605
There's not supposed to
be any night on this planet.

137
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:09,535
Why is the sky so dark?

138
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,035
This has to mean...

139
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:13,975
No, it couldn't be...

140
00:10:14,015 --> 00:10:16,445
<i>It couldn't be... It couldn't be!</i>

141
00:10:18,515 --> 00:10:20,285
<i>It couldn't be!!</i>

142
00:10:37,535 --> 00:10:43,475
Understood. I shall grant thy first wish.

143
00:10:47,545 --> 00:10:49,445
<i>No</i>!!

144
00:10:49,485 --> 00:10:52,445
The Dragon Balls are gone!

145
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:57,415
Shoot! Kakarrot's son is also missing.

146
00:10:57,455 --> 00:11:01,455
Why you dirty rotten little brat!

147
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:05,295
What's that monster over there?

148
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:12,495
Is that the dragon they said
would appear out of the Dragon Balls?

149
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:18,505
Dammit, those rotten kids
have gotten the jump on me!

150
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,815
You'll pay for this!!

151
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:28,485
<i>This is bad! Freeza is almost on top of us!</i>

152
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:32,785
<i>I'm reading four life signs.</i>

153
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:34,485
At last I've found you!

154
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:38,295
Just you wait for what you've got
coming, you crummy lower life forms!

155
00:11:44,035 --> 00:11:46,495
It vanished!

156
00:11:46,535 --> 00:11:48,005
All right.

157
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:53,005
I'm alive again! Now, for the next wish!

158
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,505
I'm counting on you, Gohan!

159
00:11:55,545 --> 00:12:00,615
I won't be responsible for this!
It's out of my hands now!

160
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:27,605
Wait... Wait! Wait!

161
00:12:40,065 --> 00:12:42,525
Kami<i>-sama</i>!

162
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:47,525
Piccolo, you rascal.
That was some smart thinking.

163
00:12:47,565 --> 00:12:51,035
Popo, you've taken good
care of the place in my absence.

164
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:52,595
Great!

165
00:12:52,635 --> 00:12:56,135
Kami<i>-sama</i> is back alive! So happy!

166
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:02,075
I have granted thine first wish.

167
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,575
Now, speak forth thy second wish!

168
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:10,085
The second wish is to have Piccolo,
who was just restored to life,

169
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:13,085
"warped" here to Planet Namek.

170
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,615
Right!

171
00:13:20,135 --> 00:13:23,795
Dende, make it fast! Vegeta's found us out!

172
00:13:25,635 --> 00:13:27,305
Okay!

173
00:13:37,155 --> 00:13:43,815
That is a simple matter.
I shall grant thine second wish.

174
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,995
Such a fool!

175
00:13:54,035 --> 00:14:01,105
I have granted thy second wish.
Thou mayest now speak thy final wish.

176
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:04,105
He said it's granted?
But Piccolo isn't here yet.

177
00:14:04,145 --> 00:14:08,105
Where are you, Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

178
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:14,115
You just said to have him brought to
this planet, so he could be anywhere.

179
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:17,115
Did you mean you wanted him brought here?

180
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,615
Oh, no!

181
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:19,955
What should we do?

182
00:14:19,995 --> 00:14:23,485
We could use the third wish to bring him–Aaah!

183
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:40,205
Vegeta!

184
00:14:40,245 --> 00:14:45,845
I knew it! I knew it was something like this!

185
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:53,525
How dare you... How dare you try
to trick me, Vegeta<i>-sama</i>, you punks!?!

186
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:55,965
You'll pay for this!

187
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,595
You simple fools!

188
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:03,595
You've taken the only chance we
had to defeat Freeza and wasted it!

189
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:08,435
The only way we can
win is if I am made immortal.

190
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,305
You dirty, stinking brats!

191
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:20,615
Wait! We've only had two wishes granted so far,

192
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:23,085
there's still one wish
that remains to be granted.

193
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,615
Idiot! Keep your mouth shut!

194
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:31,125
I'm quite relieved to hear this.

195
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:41,035
What is that column of light there?

196
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:44,035
That's where the life sign readings are...

197
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:48,645
No, they couldn't be using
the Dragon Balls to get their wish!

198
00:15:52,015 --> 00:15:55,485
What is thine third wish?

199
00:15:55,525 --> 00:16:02,085
Now then, make me eternally young! Do it now!

200
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,125
Lousy brat!

201
00:16:05,135 --> 00:16:08,095
Don't you know what "Do it now" means?!

202
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,625
Dende!

203
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:16,105
You have to do it now!
Freeza is nearly upon us!

204
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:19,105
If that wish gets granted...

205
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,105
But we don't have any choice!

206
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:25,645
Father's injuries won't
heal for some time still...

207
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:43,995
So this is my homeland?

208
00:16:44,035 --> 00:16:46,975
Planet Namek.

209
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:53,505
Then it's no wonder I feel such
an odd nostalgia for this place.

210
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:58,815
The Namekian blood that flows
within me must be responsible.

211
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:04,285
Hold on, this is no time
to be waxing sentimental.

212
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:06,985
I'd better locate Gohan and the others.

213
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,065
Shoot, where are they?

214
00:17:16,105 --> 00:17:18,435
They aren't around here anywhere close.

215
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,565
Wh-What's that?!

216
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:27,575
I can feel a tremendous <i>ki</i> off in the distance.

217
00:17:27,615 --> 00:17:31,105
Can that be the monster, Freeza?

218
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:36,285
There are three other <i>ki</i>
near them. Gohan and the others.

219
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,455
All right. Hold on, Gohan!

220
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:56,205
I still await thy final wish.
Thou mayest speak it now.

221
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:59,405
What are you waiting for?! Tell him now!

222
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,075
Make me immortally young!

223
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:05,605
Do you want to be killed by Freeza?

224
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,585
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, Freeza is almost here!

225
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,255
Our situation is desperate.

226
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:22,465
Dende! Let him have his wish!

227
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:28,205
Vegeta may also be incredibly bad,
but at least he's better than Freeza.

228
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,105
I hate to have to do this,

229
00:18:29,145 --> 00:18:34,805
but right now, there's no other
way to get us out of this pinch.

230
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:39,115
Very well.

231
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:43,985
All right, that's better.

232
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:46,985
So, do it now.

233
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,795
Okay.

234
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,495
Stop messing around!

235
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:56,495
<i>This is good! This will fix it so</i>
<i>that Freeza will not be able to kill me.</i>

236
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,935
<i>I just have to keep after him,</i>
<i>and even if I can't do it now,</i>

237
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,305
<i>eventually, I will defeat him!</i>

238
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:11,615
<i>Very soon now, the time will come when I,</i>

239
00:19:11,655 --> 00:19:17,145
<i>Vegeta-sama, will rule the universe!</i>

240
00:19:32,835 --> 00:19:34,175
What?

241
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:28,355
What's happened?

242
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:32,025
Why did the dragon disappear,
and the sky become light again?

243
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:37,025
Why have the Dragon
Balls turned into those stones?

244
00:20:37,065 --> 00:20:39,935
The Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> has...

245
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:40,935
Dende...

246
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:43,465
The Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> has...

247
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:46,815
...passed away.

248
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,025
Are you sure?

249
00:21:03,065 --> 00:21:06,425
The life of the Grand Elder<i>-sama,</i>
who created these Dragon Balls,

250
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,525
has come to an end.

251
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,035
What do you mean, you little snot?!

252
00:21:11,075 --> 00:21:16,035
What about my... what am
I supposed to do about my eternal youth?!

253
00:21:16,075 --> 00:21:17,975
What do you want me to say?

254
00:21:19,315 --> 00:21:21,545
You rotten punks!

255
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:27,545
If you hadn't double-crossed me,
none of this would have happened!

256
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:32,495
You're going to pay! You dirty, rotten fools!

257
00:21:49,045 --> 00:21:51,135
Freeza!

258
00:21:54,545 --> 00:21:57,515
You have really done it now,
have you not, gentlemen?

259
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:03,645
You have done an outstanding job of
shattering my dreams of eternal youth.

260
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:13,595
I certainly trust that you fools
are now prepared to pay the price.

261
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:19,595
<i>It's the worst possible situation–</i>
<i>Freeza has at last arrived!</i>

262
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:22,105
<i>Freeza is burning with anger.</i>

263
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:25,475
<i>In this great crisis,</i>
<i>what will happen with Piccolo?</i>

264
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:27,815
<i>What will happen with Goku?</i>

265
00:22:44,665 --> 00:22:48,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

266
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:54,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

267
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,875
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

268
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:05,375
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

269
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

270
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:15,985
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

271
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:19,495
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

272
00:23:19,535 --> 00:23:22,125
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

273
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:29,635
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

274
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,735
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

275
00:23:33,775 --> 00:23:35,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

276
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:39,575
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

277
00:23:39,615 --> 00:23:45,255
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

278
00:23:45,295 --> 00:23:47,425
<i>So sorry.</i>

279
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:52,555
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

280
00:23:55,305 --> 00:24:00,565
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

281
00:24:11,915 --> 00:24:13,615
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

282
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:15,415
<i>Crap, I didn't know he was this strong.</i>

283
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,885
<i>Freeza has shown his true nature, huh?</i>

284
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:20,255
<i>Piccolo! Hurry, there's no time!</i>

285
00:24:20,295 --> 00:24:23,125
<i>You say that by merging with Nail,</i>
<i>my power will increase many times over?</i>

286
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:26,095
<i>If I don't like what happens,</i>
<i>I'll drive you right back out again.</i>

287
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,925
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

288
00:24:27,965 --> 00:24:31,665
<i>"Birth of the Mightiest Warrior?</i>
<i>Nail and Piccolo Merge."</i>

289
00:24:31,705 --> 00:24:35,775
<i>That's surprising! Who knew</i>
<i>that Freeza could transform?</i>

290
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:38,265
"Next time"
"Birth of the Mightiest Warrior?
Nail and Piccolo Merge"
