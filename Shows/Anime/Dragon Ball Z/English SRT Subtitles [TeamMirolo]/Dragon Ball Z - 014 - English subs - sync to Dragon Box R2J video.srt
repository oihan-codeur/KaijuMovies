<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,515 --> 00:00:24,785
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:30,095
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,135 --> 00:00:36,795
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:43,405
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:52,275
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:55,785
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,825 --> 00:01:04,795
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:08,265
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:14,335
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:17,775
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:26,685
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:30,285
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:37,155
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:39,065
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:57,245
<i>In order to meet Kaio-sama, the man said</i>
<i>to be the strongest in all of the Other World,</i>

17
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,145
<i>Goku ran as hard as he could.</i>

18
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:03,285
<i>However, he slipped off of the Serpentine</i>
<i>Road and fell into the depths of Hell!</i>

19
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:51,405
<i>With great difficulty, he finally</i>
<i>located a secret cave and returned.</i>

20
00:02:54,745 --> 00:02:58,105
G-Great King Yama<i>-sama</i>?

21
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,905
<i>It was Great King Yama's office.</i>

22
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:05,575
<i>Having come back to the beginning,</i>
<i>Goku ran off to the Serpentine Road.</i>

23
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:09,755
<i>Thanks to the Enseiju fruit,</i>

24
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:11,985
<i>the mysterious item he</i>
<i>had eaten while he was in Hell,</i>

25
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,885
<i>Goku's speed had been powered-up.</i>

26
00:03:14,925 --> 00:03:20,125
<i>Eight months remain until</i>
<i>the Saiyans' assault. Hurry, Goku!</i>

27
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:28,275
<i>"Such Sweet Temptation!</i>
<i>The Snake Princess-sama's Hospitality."</i>

28
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:49,955
<i>Oni</i>?

29
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:54,135
Something's coming <i>oni.</i>

30
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,735
Watch out <i>oni</i>! Stop <i>oni</i>!

31
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:05,275
I <i>thought</i> he had fallen off
the Serpentine Road earlier <i>oni.</i>

32
00:04:05,315 --> 00:04:08,805
Be that as it may, it looks
like he's a lot faster this time <i>oni–</i>

33
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:15,645
Ah <i>oni</i>!

34
00:05:48,745 --> 00:05:52,115
Uncle Piccolo is awesome!

35
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:11,095
Well, with this many of us members
here, I'm not at all afraid of those Saiyans.

36
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:15,545
I can't wait to see what kind of
training Kami<i>-sama</i> puts us through.

37
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:30,985
Thanks to my eating that fruit,
I've already come this far in a flash.

38
00:06:37,165 --> 00:06:38,395
What's that?

39
00:06:41,705 --> 00:06:44,905
I wonder if this is Kaio<i>-sama</i>'s residence.

40
00:06:56,655 --> 00:06:59,555
What is this?! What is this?!

41
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:15,095
Welcome to our lobby, honored guest!

42
00:07:20,345 --> 00:07:23,475
Snake Princess<i>-sama</i>, we have a visitor.

43
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:25,775
What? A visitor?

44
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:39,915
My!

45
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:45,765
Such a handsome gentleman!
He's just my type!

46
00:07:49,305 --> 00:07:51,965
The Snake Princess<i>-sama</i> approaches!

47
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:59,035
Then Kaio<i>-sama</i>, you're...

48
00:08:01,545 --> 00:08:04,745
...a woman? You're cute, huh?

49
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:07,045
Cute, you say?

50
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:11,255
<i>Such a gallant gentleman!</i>
<i>For some reason, my heart is all a-flutter!</i>

51
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:14,355
The Snake Princess<i>-sama</i>
hasn't been this worked up

52
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:16,795
since Great King Yama<i>-sama</i>, has she?

53
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:19,555
Yes! He was quite handsome too!

54
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,365
It's been nearly five hundred years, I'll bet.

55
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:23,995
F-Five hundred years?!

56
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:30,875
Well, no matter. Never mind that,
Kaio<i>-sama</i>, teach me some martial arts.

57
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:33,945
M-Martial arts?

58
00:08:33,985 --> 00:08:37,285
How about instead, we dance the tango?

59
00:08:55,135 --> 00:09:01,135
This is so romantic! Surely we
were destined to come together.

60
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:05,375
<i>The tango is a lot like the</i>
<i>dance we did at my wedding.</i>

61
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,845
<i>So this is Kaio-sama's</i>
<i>martial arts technique.</i>

62
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:18,145
I get it! This is a technique to get your
opponent off their guard, then clobber them!

63
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,295
–Ee-yow!
–Kaio<i>-sama</i> is a lot weaker than I thought...

64
00:09:23,335 --> 00:09:26,295
What are you doing?! She is not Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

65
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:28,295
This is the Snake Princess<i>-sama,</i>

66
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:31,265
who shone in the glory of victory
at the Other World Beauty Contest!

67
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:35,135
What? You ain't Kaio<i>-sama</i>? I'm leaving.

68
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:37,275
G-Goodness, no!

69
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:38,675
Please wait!

70
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:40,275
I'm in a hurry!

71
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:43,675
A-At least have dinner before you go.

72
00:09:43,715 --> 00:09:47,655
D-Dinner? Come to think of it...

73
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:59,625
...I ain't eaten anything since that
piece of fruit. I guess I'll eat before I go.

74
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,895
I'm so happy! Okay, okay, you guys,
quickly prepare something for dinner!

75
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:04,925
–Right!
–Right!

76
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:15,575
You guys understand, right? We'll do
whatever it takes to keep that man here!

77
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,845
After all, he's the kind of nice man
we haven't had for five hundred years.

78
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,585
I won't have him get away from us!

79
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,715
Snake Princess<i>-sama</i>, if I mix this
sleeping potion in with the cooking,

80
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:27,025
it will bring on an irresistible urge to sleep,

81
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:30,695
he'll doze off, and won't leave here!

82
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:35,595
Well, it's not a very elegant
method, but what choice do we have?

83
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:42,545
Sorry to keep you waiting.

84
00:10:46,075 --> 00:10:48,405
We have foie gras, made
from the bird of paradise,

85
00:10:48,445 --> 00:10:50,945
sauté of bear's paw, from Needle Mountain,

86
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:56,115
baked crocodile, taken from the
River Sanzu, and mussels au gratin.

87
00:10:58,395 --> 00:10:59,255
Let's dig in!

88
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:02,255
Yes, yes, be my guest!
Help yourself to as much as you like.

89
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,235
All right, I'm eating!

90
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:28,815
I-If you like, help
yourself to my serving as well.

91
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:31,915
Really? Thanks!

92
00:11:31,955 --> 00:11:34,155
Okay, then... I'll take it...

93
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:54,535
I'm full, I'm full!

94
00:11:55,885 --> 00:11:57,445
Well then, I guess I should go.

95
00:11:57,485 --> 00:12:00,285
Please, wait! Are you not sleepy?

96
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:05,355
I ain't got time to sleep. I've got
to go meet Kaio<i>-sama</i> and everything.

97
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:09,285
You're sure you put
the sleeping stuff in, right?

98
00:12:09,325 --> 00:12:11,295
Yes, plenty of it.

99
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:14,125
Thanks for dinner. Okay then, I'm going.

100
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,925
You guys!

101
00:12:15,965 --> 00:12:20,535
Please, wait. We have a bath warmed up.
How about if you took a bath before going?

102
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:23,665
Kaio<i>-sama</i> dislikes dirty people.

103
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:28,275
Yeah, maybe I am a little sweaty.
Maybe I should freshen up before I go.

104
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,475
–Yes, yes!
–Yes, yes!

105
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:55,245
This feels great.

106
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:00,575
How is the water?

107
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:03,915
Fine. It's a little bit hot, but it's okay.

108
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,085
This originally comes
from the steam baths of Hell.

109
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,025
He should be warmed
clear through to the bone!

110
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:13,885
Okay.

111
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:32,745
Huh? Suddenly it's become night.

112
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:38,715
Goku<i>-sama</i>, there are so many stars.

113
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:42,385
To think that I should be together with
you on such a wonderful evening, Goku<i>-sama,</i>

114
00:13:42,425 --> 00:13:44,615
it makes the Snake Princess so happy...

115
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:49,255
Say there, Goku<i>-sama</i>?

116
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:51,695
Goku<i>-sama</i>?

117
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,065
Oh, my...

118
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:01,965
T-This is terrible!
He's been boiled alive!

119
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:07,105
98... 99... 100!

120
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:11,975
Oh, that's refreshing!

121
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:21,785
How embarrassing! But
still, what a manly figure he has.

122
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:23,955
Wow, that was revitalizing!
Okay then, I'll be going.

123
00:14:23,995 --> 00:14:25,985
Ah, wait!

124
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:29,925
Hey you guys, stop him!

125
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:33,935
–Just a moment!
–What is it? I'm in a hurry!

126
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:37,935
I have to hurry and see Kaio<i>-sama,</i>
and learn martial arts from him!

127
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:42,975
In that case, then we have
just the thing! How about this?

128
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:46,945
A thrilling, spine-tingling
game of Russian Roulette!

129
00:14:46,985 --> 00:14:50,285
You can help train your
mind to overcome fear with this!

130
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:55,485
Russian Roulette?
How does it train your mind?

131
00:14:57,735 --> 00:15:01,695
First, you take one bullet
and place it into the pistol.

132
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,965
Then you spin it round and round.

133
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,665
The chances of the bullet
being shot are one in six.

134
00:15:09,705 --> 00:15:11,675
When it does, that's the end of the story.

135
00:15:11,715 --> 00:15:14,845
It's a game brimming with
thrills, in exchange for one's life!

136
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:22,715
That ended all too easily, huh?
I ain't doing anything that dangerous.

137
00:15:23,995 --> 00:15:28,555
Thank you for waiting! It is now showtime!

138
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:33,355
Yes, yes, please leave
after you've watched this show!

139
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,965
Is this martial arts too?

140
00:15:35,005 --> 00:15:38,165
Yes! It is a new martial art.

141
00:15:45,215 --> 00:15:46,035
Snake Princess<i>-sama,</i>

142
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:49,705
this time I made sure to use
all the sleeping potion we had left.

143
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,275
Make it good.

144
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,915
Here, have some specially prepared juice.

145
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:59,585
Wow, thanks.

146
00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:07,795
Yummy!

147
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,935
<i>For this guy to have eaten and drank</i>
<i>that much sleeping potion and still be alive–</i>

148
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:21,035
<i>what is he, a monster?</i>

149
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:39,925
We did it! He should be asleep
for three days and nights like this!

150
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,225
He's pretty tough, huh?

151
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:43,935
Yes. He is no ordinary person.

152
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:46,765
But you know, he has such
a lovely face when he's asleep.

153
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:49,935
He really is my type.

154
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:52,305
Chichi... Gohan...

155
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:56,475
He's having some kind of dream.
Bring the dream-viewing mirror.

156
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,375
Right.

157
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:01,685
This will reflect whatever dream he is having.

158
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:04,385
Chichi... Gohan...

159
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:06,485
–Father!
–Goku<i>-sa</i>!

160
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,955
What's this? A woman and a boy?

161
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:12,455
Ah, apparently they are his wife and child.

162
00:17:12,495 --> 00:17:17,435
He's not single?!
He still looks delicious, though!

163
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:19,095
Are you going to eat this one too?

164
00:17:19,135 --> 00:17:21,935
I wonder if there will be any for us this time.

165
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:25,935
After all, the only one to get out of
here safely has been Great King Yama.

166
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,815
Good, Gohan!

167
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:38,355
Once you've finished doin' those
drills, your studyin' is done for today.

168
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:41,485
Mm-hmm. I want to
hurry up and go out and play.

169
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:52,165
W-Who are you?!

170
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,875
I'm scared! Father!

171
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:00,545
Goku<i>-sa</i>!

172
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:08,945
Gohan!

173
00:18:08,985 --> 00:18:09,975
Chichi!

174
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:16,355
Oh, it was a dream,
was it? Did I fall asleep?

175
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,355
He's awake already, isn't he?

176
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,625
Yeah...

177
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:22,965
That's right! I was on
my way to see Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

178
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:24,965
Please, don't go!

179
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:29,445
Sorry, but I'm going. Everyone on
Earth is waiting for me to come back.

180
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:31,675
You're going, no matter what?

181
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:33,175
Yeah, no matter what.

182
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:36,915
Why, you–!

183
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,755
I am the Serpentine Road Goddess,

184
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:49,655
who has lived on the Serpentine Road
for a thousand and five hundred years!

185
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:53,655
How dare you bring disgrace upon me!

186
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:58,435
Now listen to me! You will
never return home from here!

187
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,745
What is this?

188
00:19:12,715 --> 00:19:17,155
If you cannot realize my charms,
then you can just dissolve away!

189
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:27,125
This is bad! I've got
to get out of here quick!

190
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:39,945
Dammit...

191
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,115
That was close!

192
00:19:53,155 --> 00:19:55,285
Why, you...!

193
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:57,955
You're not getting away!

194
00:20:12,515 --> 00:20:15,675
Damn! In that case...

195
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,675
Ka... me...

196
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:23,115
No, I won't. She did
feed me all that food, after all.

197
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,955
Hey, let me pass!

198
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:29,725
I have to hurry and go see Kaio<i>-sama</i>!

199
00:20:30,165 --> 00:20:34,535
No way! If you want to
live, you'll have to defeat me!

200
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:40,135
Damn... I know!

201
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:47,745
Wait up!

202
00:21:05,335 --> 00:21:07,695
See you! Thanks for the meal!

203
00:21:07,735 --> 00:21:09,295
And the bath, too!

204
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,325
This is so degrading!

205
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:11,725
<i>The journey to Kaio-sama is still far.</i>

206
00:22:11,765 --> 00:22:15,465
<i>The Saiyans' assault is drawing near.</i>

207
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:29,405
<i>Hurry, Goku! Run the</i>
<i>length of the Serpentine Road!</i>

208
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:48,495
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

209
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:54,405
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

210
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:56,775
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

211
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:05,275
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

212
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:11,755
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

213
00:23:11,795 --> 00:23:15,825
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

214
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:19,325
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

215
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:21,995
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

216
00:23:23,705 --> 00:23:29,505
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

217
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:33,605
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

218
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,445
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

219
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:39,475
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

220
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:45,155
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

221
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:47,315
<i>So sorry.</i>

222
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:52,425
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

223
00:23:55,165 --> 00:24:00,405
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

224
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,145
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

225
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:15,645
<i>What? Gohan ran away?</i>

226
00:24:15,685 --> 00:24:19,055
<i>You can't blame him.</i>
<i>Piccolo's training is too harsh!</i>

227
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:23,385
<i>I can't turn back now. I've got to tough it out.</i>

228
00:24:23,425 --> 00:24:25,425
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

229
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:28,825
<i>"Escape from Piccolo!</i>
<i>Gohan Summons a Storm."</i>

230
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:33,065
<i>It's okay. I'm just going to go</i>
<i>see my mother for a little while.</i>

231
00:24:34,605 --> 00:24:38,065
"Next time"
"Escape from Piccolo!
Gohan Summons a Storm"
