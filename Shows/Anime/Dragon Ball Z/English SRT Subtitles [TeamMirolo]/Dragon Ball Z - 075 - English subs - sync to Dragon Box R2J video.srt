1
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,430
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,740
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,230
<i>Change</i>!!

17
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,580
I did it!

18
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,580
<i>Finally, the battle against the</i>
<i>mighty Ginyu comes to a conclusion.</i>

19
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:53,760
<i>However, the damage inflicted</i>
<i>upon Goku is great, and as for Vegeta...</i>

20
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,930
I know that Freeza is probably there too,

21
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,940
but if we can't get the
password, nothing matters anyhow.

22
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,340
Me too!

23
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,040
No. I can handle this myself. You wait here.

24
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,950
<i>And so, in order to learn</i>
<i>how to summon Shen Long,</i>

25
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,150
<i>Kuririn takes off toward</i>
<i>the Grand Elder's location...</i>

26
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,630
<i>"Thou Who Hast Gathered the Seven Balls...</i>
<i>Now Speak Forth the Password."</i>

27
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,610
I wonder if I look any stronger.

28
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,110
I bet if Mother–

29
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,420
or Piccolo<i>-san</i> were to see me
in this outfit, they'd be surprised.

30
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,900
But for some reason, I sure
feel as though I'm stronger now!

31
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,570
I'm the strongest warrior
in the universe, Son Gohan!

32
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,710
Hey, you there!

33
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,710
That pip-squeak friend of
yours said something about...

34
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,420
...taking two hours
before he would return, right?

35
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,090
Yeah.

36
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,100
All right, then.

37
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,040
Stand guard over those Dragon Balls well, then.

38
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,040
I'll be taking a nap inside the spaceship.

39
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,210
Wake me when he gets back.

40
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,880
A nap?

41
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,590
I haven't had any sleep now for quite a while.

42
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,570
Just sit tight, Gohan and Goku!

43
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,740
I'll find out how to summon
Shen Long and be back soon.

44
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,570
That rotten creep!

45
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,580
I can't even be sure he hasn't
already killed the Grand Elder<i>-san!</i>

46
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,610
Please, let me make it in time!

47
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,760
I have to tell Kuririn and the others
about the password as soon as possible!

48
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,440
There they are!

49
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,710
Strange.

50
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,050
I don't feel any <i>ki.</i>

51
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm too late!

52
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,530
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

53
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,880
It's not him!

54
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,420
Okay then, where is Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

55
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,370
Kakarrot.

56
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,310
Once Freeza is out of the way, you're next.

57
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,580
Until then, I need you on my side.

58
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,230
I can't believe I've let myself come to this...

59
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,710
I'll sleep for thirty minutes.

60
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,750
That should be enough to
allow me to count on my full power.

61
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,890
<i>When I open my eyes again,</i>

62
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,770
<i>I will be able to obtain</i>
<i>eternal life and youth for myself.</i>

63
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,070
<i>That should make for some pleasant dreams.</i>

64
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,050
Freeza could show up at any minute.

65
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:25,580
He's got a lot of nerve going to sleep.

66
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,020
I am only using my left hand,
yet you have still done so poorly.

67
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,720
Surely now you see
there is no way you can win.

68
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:03,690
How about speaking to me now?

69
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,400
Tell me how the Dragon Balls grant my wish.

70
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,560
You have continued to expend
your energies so pointlessly.

71
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,030
Such actions cannot possibly
work against me, can they?

72
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,070
Have you not fully realized this yet?

73
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,370
I cannot understand
why you continue to defy me,

74
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,040
when you must certainly
know you are beaten?

75
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,550
Is it because your friends have been killed?

76
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,750
Or perhaps, is it due to
common stubbornness?

77
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,060
Let me make this my final warning.

78
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,090
Tell me how the Dragon Balls grant wishes.

79
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,410
You will die, otherwise.

80
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,220
Even if you were to find out,
by now, it no longer matters.

81
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,250
Very soon, Dende will arrive at the...
location where the... Earthlings are.

82
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:47,560
He is there to tell the...
the very same password you're after!

83
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,430
What?!

84
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,470
<i>Him?</i>

85
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,280
Why you! You've just been buying time for him?!

86
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,550
The Ginyu Special Corps–
I get no reading on them!

87
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:12,550
Can it be that all five of
them have been eliminated?

88
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:15,390
In any case, something's happened
between Vegeta, the Earthlings,

89
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:19,060
and the Ginyu Special Corps!

90
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,760
So what's happened to the Dragon Balls?!

91
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,410
Rotten punks!

92
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,080
It will be to me, Freeza<i>-sama,</i>
that that wish is granted!

93
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,450
It will not be to you lower life forms!

94
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,860
How regrettable that it must come to this.

95
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:57,530
I should have told the Earthlings
the password when I had the chance.

96
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,070
Now I've caused Nail to suffer so terribly.

97
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:17,620
Move swiftly, Dende.
It seems my end has drawn near.

98
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,430
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

99
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,400
Gohan<i>-san</i>!

100
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,730
I wonder if it really will take
Kuririn<i>-san</i> two whole hours to get to

101
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,200
the Grand Elder<i>-san</i> and back.

102
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,730
What am I supposed to do if
Freeza comes back before then?

103
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,410
I hope Kuririn<i>-san</i> gets back soon.

104
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,400
A <i>ki</i>!

105
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,110
Someone is flying towards Goku's direction.

106
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,410
I recognize this <i>ki.</i>

107
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,050
I knew it! It's Dende!

108
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,430
<i>Hey</i>!

109
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,400
It's me, it's me!

110
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,430
I'm just dressed this way is all.

111
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,730
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

112
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,610
–Thank goodness!
–Thank goodness!

113
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,400
Hey, you...

114
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,740
You're that bad Ginyu fellow, who took
over my father's body and such, aren't you?

115
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:34,750
I knew it! Come here, you!

116
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,420
You can't do anymore bad stuff now.

117
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,550
This really saves our necks.

118
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,220
We've gotten all the Dragon Balls together,
but we couldn't get Shen Long to appear,

119
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,560
So I was just on my way to the
Grand Elder<i>-san</i>'s place to find out

120
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,730
what the password is.

121
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,230
That's what I thought.

122
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,230
I was told by the Grand Elder<i>-sama</i> to find you

123
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,440
and tell you how to get your wish granted.

124
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,440
Oh, really? So, what is
it we're supposed to say?

125
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,880
The password must be spoken
in the Namekian language,

126
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,410
or else the wish will not be granted.

127
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,410
Namekian, huh? That makes sense.

128
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,720
The Grand Elder<i>-san</i> isn't very good with people,

129
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,890
or else he could have told
us that while we were there.

130
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,220
He must not have thought...

131
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,720
...you were going to be able to get all
the Dragon Balls together, or he would have.

132
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,890
Maybe so.

133
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,060
Never mind that, we must hurry!

134
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,630
The Grand Elder<i>-sama</i>'s life is nearly at an end.

135
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,070
Freeza might be on his way, as well.

136
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,770
Yeah, you're right.

137
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,780
Something's coming...

138
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,780
It's Kuririn<i>-san...</i> But I can feel two <i>ki...</i>

139
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,860
He's hidden his <i>ki</i>!

140
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,360
It really is Kuririn<i>-san.</i>

141
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,390
But who's with him?

142
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,430
It's Dende<i>-kun</i>! Yeah!

143
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,740
–We made it! It's Gohan!
–Thank goodness!

144
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,210
That was incredibly fast!
How did you manage it?

145
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:50,220
Easy. Dende here was asked by
the Grand Elder<i>-san</i> to come to us.

146
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,220
You mean, to tell us how to use the
Dragon Balls and get our wish granted?

147
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,390
Right!

148
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,220
Now then, what's Vegeta up to?

149
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,700
I've been holding my <i>ki</i> since before we
got here so he wouldn't realize we're back.

150
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,200
I don't think he's noticed.

151
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,530
He said something about
not having slept recently,

152
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,400
and is napping inside the spaceship.

153
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,970
Great! This is working out nicely.

154
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,540
Okay, then. Very quietly,
so Vegeta doesn't notice,

155
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,880
we'll carry the Dragon Balls over to this area.

156
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,880
That way, even if he realizes
that Shen Long has appeared,

157
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,080
we'll have bought some time.

158
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:50,810
Yahoo! We did it!

159
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,220
Okay, it's up to you now, Dende.

160
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,250
Right!

161
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,740
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, something's coming this way.

162
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,440
Very fast.

163
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,180
It's Freeza!

164
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,050
Hurry, Dende! Hurry and get our wish granted!

165
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,580
Right!

166
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Nothing's happening.

167
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,430
Hey, Dende, are you sure
you didn't goof up the password?

168
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,280
They're glowing!

169
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,410
The sky is getting dark!

170
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,450
Just like the Dragon Balls on Earth!

171
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,030
What's this?

172
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,730
Why has it suddenly become night?

173
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,530
It looks like the wish will soon be granted!

174
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,300
–They did it!
–Yeah!

175
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,800
We can finally return to life!

176
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,250
Isn't this great, Ten<i>-san</i>?

177
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,890
He-He's huge!

178
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,060
Far bigger than the one on Earth.

179
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,400
Is-Is that Shen Long?

180
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,780
Here, he is called "Polunga."
It means "God of Dreams."

181
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,380
This is the first time I've seen him, too.

182
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:43,720
Thou who hast gathered the
Dragon Balls, now speak thy wishes.

183
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,390
I shall grant thee any three wishes,
whichsoever art within my ability.

184
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,390
Three? Did he just say three?

185
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,900
That's right. You can have three wishes granted.

186
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,440
Really?! Looks like Nail<i>-san</i> was right!

187
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,070
What should we do?
We have three wishes, three!

188
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,450
<i>Polunga, the "Super"</i>
<i>Shen Long finally appears...</i>

189
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,920
<i>What will Kuririn and the others</i>
<i>ask for with their three wishes?</i>

190
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,620
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

191
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,460
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

192
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,830
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

193
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

194
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,840
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

195
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,940
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

196
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,450
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

197
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,080
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

198
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,590
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

199
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,690
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

200
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,500
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

201
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,530
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

202
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:45,210
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

203
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,380
<i>So sorry.</i>

204
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,510
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

205
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,520
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

206
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,070
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

207
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:17,340
<i>They did it! The original Shen</i>
<i>Long brought Piccolo back to life!</i>

208
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,910
<i>You have really done it now,</i>
<i>have you not, gentlemen?</i>

209
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:23,780
<i>You have done an outstanding job of</i>
<i>shattering my dreams of eternal youth.</i>

210
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,180
<i>I trust that you are prepared to pay the price.</i>

211
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,050
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

212
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,550
<i>"Kami-sama Also Returns to Life!</i>
<i>Piccolo Is Resurrected by Super Shen Long."</i>

213
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,660
<i>I really will be glad</i>
<i>once Piccolo-san gets here.</i>

214
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,220
"Next time"
"Kami<i>-sama</i> Also Returns to Life!
Piccolo Is Resurrected by Super Shen Long"
