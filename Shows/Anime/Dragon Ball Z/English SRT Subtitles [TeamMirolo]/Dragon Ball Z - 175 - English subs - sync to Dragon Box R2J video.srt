00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,320
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,620
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,920
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,630
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:43,220
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:52,100
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,610
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:04,620
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,080
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,170
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,590
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:26,510
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

13
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,100
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,980
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,900
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,190
<i>Goku flew all around the Earth,</i>

17
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:21,190
<i>seeking the Dragon Balls that were</i>
<i>restored by Dende, the new Kami-sama.</i>

18
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:36,790
I've got all seven together now!

19
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:43,300
<i>And so, the day of the</i>
<i>Cell Games drew ever closer...</i>

20
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,570
<i>The battle begins in one hour!</i>

21
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,200
<i>"Those Who Would Challenge Cell!!</i>
<i>The Curtain Rises on the Battle."</i>

22
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,890
All right, I guess I better go.

23
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,160
Be careful, Goku-<i>sa</i>! Don't go dyin'.

24
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,700
Yeah, I know.

25
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,120
Gohan-<i>chan</i>'s not fightin', right?

26
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,540
U-Um...

27
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,920
Promise me you won't let Gohan-<i>chan</i> fight!

28
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,800
Well, I'm off!

29
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,130
Now, look here!

30
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,680
H-He might be fightin'... Gohan-<i>chan...</i>

31
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,240
Father!

32
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,240
He's here, he's here!

33
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,820
It's just about time.

34
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,830
Huh? Where's Vegeta?

35
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,200
He left a moment ago.

36
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,670
Is that right? Vegeta must be all
fired up. I bet he's improved himself.

37
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,810
What is it with everyone?
What are you so gloomy about?

38
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,560
Are you nervous?

39
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,980
Goku, something bad has turned up.

40
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,280
It's the Dragon Balls.

41
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,240
We had them made so that we could bring a
lot of people back to life with one wish, right?

42
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,240
Yeah.

43
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,620
By doing that, they're like they were before,

44
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,410
where if someone has already died
once, they can't be returned to life.

45
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,830
I'm sorry. I should have said so from the start.

46
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,760
Hey, don't let it bother you, Dende.

47
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,840
We're fine, as long as we don't die, right?

48
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:35,430
A-As long as we don't die? We're taking on Cell!

49
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,220
It's okay, it's okay.

50
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,680
Let's hurry and get going,
or we won't make it by 12 o'clock!

51
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:56,990
<i>It's just about time! Come quickly, Son Goku!</i>

52
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,250
Just over twenty minutes remain
until the start of the Cell Games,

53
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,420
which will decide the fate of the Earth!

54
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,130
As might be expected,
there are no spectators in the area,

55
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,420
perhaps for fear of being caught in the battle!

56
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,630
As you can see,

57
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,930
Cell has just been standing in
the middle of the ring, unwavering.

58
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,720
Our hero, Mister Satan,

59
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,850
who will be taking Cell down,
has not yet shown himself.

60
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,360
Oh, what car is this?!

61
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,660
Oh, it is indeed Satan!

62
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,750
Mister Satan has arrived!

63
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,340
Oh, he has turned toward the
camera, holding his fist high!

64
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,050
He is responding to the warm
backing of the people of the whole world!

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,430
Satan!

66
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,140
Satan!

67
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,840
Oh, my! Mister Satan is
already declaring his victory!

68
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,010
It's just like Satan, the combat
sports champion of the world!

69
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,050
It looks as though, when faced
with the strongest man on earth,

70
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,260
not even Cell is able to conceal his anxiety!

71
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,430
What's with this piece of trash?

72
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,350
And so, only twenty minutes remain
until the start of the Cell Games!

73
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,230
Cell vs. Satan!

74
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,570
In my own personal estimation,
Satan has a slight lead on Cell!

75
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,450
Mister Satan, with his stately, heroic spirit,

76
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,160
is burning in anticipation of victory!

77
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:19,260
Oh, my! Satan is about
to enter the ring already!

78
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,850
There is plenty of time still
before the matches are to begin,

79
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,350
but he is driven!

80
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:27,560
Just what you'd expect of the
most dependable man on earth!

81
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,030
C-Could he be telling us to come on down?

82
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,410
Th-This is most... er...

83
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,170
V-Very well! Let's go!

84
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:00,260
We are pros as well! Let's have
everyone see just how brave we are!

85
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,340
B-Besides which, no matter what else,

86
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,220
Mister Satan is here, so we can be at ease!

87
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,440
P-Please take a close look at these
images, overflowing with tension!

88
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,280
Right now, toward the ring which will
indeed determine the fate of the world,

89
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,110
the most courageous announcer
in the world is approaching!

90
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,670
Um, should we come up into the ring as well?

91
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,260
I am with you. Do not worry.

92
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,470
V-Very well then...

93
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,270
Could you share with us,
Mister Satan, how you feel right now?

94
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,770
I have sympathy for Cell here,
whose reckoning has gone awry.

95
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,820
He couldn't possibly have known

96
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,780
that there was someone in
this world as strong as I am.

97
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,610
Yes, yes...

98
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,660
He went and talked like a bigshot,

99
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:11,200
and now, it is too late for him to
get off with just saying "I'm sorry."

100
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,170
Listen to me, Cell! Your secret is out!

101
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,750
The way you destroyed
our capital's military forces

102
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,170
was through using tricks involving explosives!

103
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,840
But that isn't going to work on me!

104
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,600
H-He's pretending he can't hear you.

105
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,980
He's so nervous, he doesn't know what to say!

106
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,190
In that case, let's make
contemptuous faces at him!

107
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,660
And I'll give him a good spanky-spanky!

108
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,750
It might be okay if he does get killed...

109
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,860
It's Yamucha-<i>san</i>, with Tenshinhan-<i>san</i>!

110
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,490
We're going too.

111
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,660
We probably won't be
joining in the fighting, however.

112
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,920
All right. Come on, everyone!

113
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,340
I'm gonna pound your head!

114
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,390
Mister Satan is composed!

115
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,430
He's overwhelming Cell with his composure!

116
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,850
Even before this fight has begun,

117
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,270
Mister Satan's victory is a foregone conclusion!

118
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,780
What's that...?

119
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,780
Is something the matter?

120
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,250
W-What in the world is that...?

121
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,590
<i>Vegeta...</i>

122
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,670
<i>So you've come, in spite</i>
<i>of what happened before?</i>

123
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,550
<i>I'm sure you've improved yourself, as well.</i>

124
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,450
Um... a strange man has just appeared.

125
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:39,290
I-It looked as though he
flew here, through the air...

126
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,290
It's a trick, all right.

127
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,290
Could he possibly be planning to
enter into the Cell Games as well?

128
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,470
Let's ask him. So, who are you?

129
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,260
If you've come to watch,

130
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,760
it's too dangerous for you to be this close.

131
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,350
Get lost, and don't ever talk to me again.

132
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,100
Oh, my...

133
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:07,400
He's nothing more than a slightly crazy person.

134
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,360
His hairstyle is strange, too.

135
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,070
Those are the kinds of guys
who make the most trouble,

136
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,780
by getting in the way.

137
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,500
And so, in five more minutes,

138
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,460
the Cell Games, focus of
attention for the entire world,

139
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,170
with the fate of the Earth
at stake, will commence!

140
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:36,600
As I expected, Mister Satan is the
only one who will be fighting Cell!

141
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,510
However, that is only to be expected!

142
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,600
Mister Satan is the all-out
combat sports champion of the world!

143
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,810
He alone is all that will be needed!

144
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,210
A-Again, it appears someone has flown in...

145
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:08,210
H-He's using a trick, too.

146
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,170
This is a surprise. No. 16, huh?

147
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,920
I'm surprised you even still exist.

148
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,840
What's more, your damage
has been repaired, hasn't it?

149
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,890
<i>The only ones who could have repaired</i>
<i>that robot are Bulma and Bulma's father.</i>

150
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,730
<i>This isn't their concern...!</i>

151
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,440
C-Cell just muttered something, right?

152
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,610
Perhaps he knows that man?

153
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:38,320
Who knows? In any case,
he doesn't look all that tough.

154
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,540
So, it appears you've finally come, Son Goku.

155
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,340
I've been waiting for this!

156
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,090
S-Say there, look at that...

157
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:59,430
What?

158
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,240
I see them! Over there!

159
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,150
All right, let's go!

160
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,250
W-Who are those guys?!

161
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,830
Stay out of Satan's way!

162
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:15,790
G-Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

163
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:21,380
C-Cut that out! Gohan! Don't fight! Gohan!

164
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,220
–Gohan-<i>chan</i>, I say! Gohan-<i>chan</i>!
–Chichi! Calm down! Chichi! Settle down!

165
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,810
Don't go fightin'! Don't die!
Don't go dyin', Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

166
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:32,940
Gohan-<i>chan</i>, stop that! Cut that out!

167
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,830
Welcome, all of you!

168
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,330
<i>A whole slew of them came!</i>

169
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,340
I-It looked as though all of them flew here...

170
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,550
I-It appears this trick of theirs is in vogue.

171
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,320
No. 16! Are you all better?

172
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,820
I wanted to express my gratitude.

173
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,410
Thanks, Kuririn. Thanks to you, I'm all fixed up.

174
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,160
Is that so? That's great, huh?

175
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,080
Let's all hang in there together, okay?

176
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,010
Son Goku, I was built in order to kill you.

177
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,930
Do not forget that.

178
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,940
This guy sure is grim, ain't he?

179
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,530
I'm not getting any attention...

180
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,370
Has fight started?

181
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,250
Not yet, it appears.

182
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,210
Now, then...

183
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,380
Maybe you should let me fight first.

184
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,390
We don't necessarily need you
to fight right off the bat, Goku-<i>san.</i>

185
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:32,220
It's okay with you, right Vegeta?

186
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,600
Do as you like.

187
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,310
Either way, I will be the
one who finishes him off.

188
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,450
D-Don't you go making your own order!

189
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,830
Um, by any chance,

190
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,750
were you fellows thinking of
competing in the Cell Games here?

191
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,040
That's right. Not all of us, though.

192
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,710
That's enough of your foolishness!
This is not a game!

193
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,720
You guys don't understand anything!

194
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,930
You're the one who doesn't understand.

195
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,390
This is a surprise.

196
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,610
To think that there should
still be some shameless yokels,

197
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,320
who don't know about me, Mister Satan,

198
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,820
the number one name in
the world of combat sports!

199
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,910
Now listen! Satan here is the
world combat sports champion!

200
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,910
He's the strongest man in the whole world–!

201
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,710
All right, then, as a special
free service, I will explain it to you.

202
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,320
How about that?!

203
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:12,200
I-Incredible! That's our Mister Satan! Incredible!

204
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:23,670
Th-They're not at all surprised...

205
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,170
Goku, it's okay, just let them go first.

206
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,670
F-Fine with me...

207
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,300
It's time!

208
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,350
<i>The Cell Games, the tournament of</i>
<i>martial arts tactics, is about to begin.</i>

209
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:25,100

210
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:48,920
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

211

219

<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

221

<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

222
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:45,520
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

223
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,690
<i>So sorry.</i>

224
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,820

227

<i>Huh? Here come some more weirdoes.</i>

228
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,680
<i>Satan's number-one and number-two pupils?</i>

229

<i>And now, two new challengers have arrived!</i>

230
