<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,665 --> 00:00:43,175
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:52,055
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

00:00:55,605 --> 00:01:04,575
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>

9
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:08,035
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10

<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>

<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>

15
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:38,895
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:55,035
<i>In order to surpass being Super Saiyan,</i>
<i>Son Goku, together with Gohan,</i>

17
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:57,375
<i>had entered into the Room of Spirit and Time,</i>

18
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,625
<i>to undergo some full-fledged training.</i>

19
00:02:04,465 --> 00:02:07,175
Get angry! Pop off, with a bang!

20
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:13,935
<i>Elsewhere, Artificial Human Cell</i>

21
00:02:13,975 --> 00:02:17,895
<i>was matching up against</i>
<i>the abilities of a reborn Vegeta.</i>

22
00:02:17,935 --> 00:02:18,815
<i>The battle found Vegeta,</i>

23
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:24,985
<i>who had obtained power far beyond</i>
<i>that of Super Saiyan, winning hands-down.</i>

24
00:02:34,035 --> 00:02:36,995
So, this is your level after all?

25
00:02:38,495 --> 00:02:39,955
Apparently, during my training,

26
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:43,715
I opened up too wide a
gap between our powers...

27
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:51,465
Impossible! You're Vegeta,
aren't you? Am I wrong?

28
00:02:52,845 --> 00:02:56,515
I am Super Vegeta!

29
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:05,905
<i>"Dangerous Pride!!</i>
<i>A Challenge to Cell's Perfect Form."</i>

30
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:27,795
Dad has this won.

31
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:33,175
Super Vegeta, you say? W-What's that?

32
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:35,845
It'd be too much trouble to explain in detail.

33
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:38,845
Imagine whatever you like yourself.

34
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:44,025
Swagger around as Super Vegeta, will you?

35
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:49,065
In the future, you have been
killed by Artificial Human No. 17!

36
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:53,035
I have absorbed the
power of No. 17 as well!

37
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:55,785
Even a child would understand
which one of us must be stronger!

38
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:02,545
Hmph. So this is what "yelping
as much as a weak dog" means.

39
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:06,715
If you've got the time to brag, spend
it figuring out how to defend yourself.

40
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:09,215
However hopeless that might be.

41
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:27,565
Cell has changed quite a bit from before.

42
00:04:27,605 --> 00:04:30,775
I-Is that what he calls his perfect form?

43
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:32,735
Has he already gotten No. 18 and the others?

44
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:43,375
A-And after all the trouble
Bulma-<i>san</i> went through to make this!

45
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:45,955
Will it have been for nothing as well?

46
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:58,475
T-That's Dad's <i>Gyallic Ho</i> attack!

47
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:01,805
Your cells are also within me!

48
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,775
Take this!!

49
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:09,985
Dad!

50
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,125
V-Vegeta!

51
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:14,715
I-Incredible! Vegeta!

52
00:06:17,215 --> 00:06:19,725
Vegeta has this won.

53
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:21,925
I can't believe it.

54
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:35,735
That's just what I had expected
of you, having obtained my cells.

55
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,195
However, although you may
be able to mimic my <i>Gyallic Ho,</i>

56
00:06:38,235 --> 00:06:42,155
there was no way you could get
past the difference in our powers.

57
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:43,905
Enough!

58
00:06:45,745 --> 00:06:47,705
For you to not understand such a thing,

59
00:06:47,745 --> 00:06:50,045
does it mean that the
inside of your head is hollow?

60
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:54,545
I won't allow something
like this to happen!!

61
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:02,805
I-Impossible!

62
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:08,395
W-Why?!

63
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:23,905
Awesome!

64
00:07:23,945 --> 00:07:26,745
He's become ridiculously strong!

65
00:07:26,785 --> 00:07:28,745
His body has also become larger...

66
00:07:28,785 --> 00:07:31,795
He's not the same
Vegeta he was up until now.

67
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:34,835
Is this a new Vegeta?

68
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:49,765
What sort of training
do you suppose Vegeta

69
00:07:49,805 --> 00:07:52,105
did in the Room of Spirit and Time?

70
00:07:52,145 --> 00:07:55,945
Will Son also emerge with
power even greater than Vegeta's?

71
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:58,315
Son will not get a turn at this rate, huh?

72
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:01,155
Vegeta is going to
finish this by himself.

73
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:04,905
You see, Trunks? Your father is incredible!

74
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:06,825
He's going to beat Cell, after all.

75
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:16,755
You know something,
I didn't need to work overnight.

76
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:20,965
The emergency shutdown
controller won't be necessary now, huh?

77
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,695
Gohan! Get angry! Pop off, with a bang!

78
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:52,575
Pop off, with a bang!!

79
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:05,715
I must have fallen
asleep without realizing it...

80
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:12,185
Father?

81
00:09:12,225 --> 00:09:14,395
<i>Ka...</i>

82
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:22,065
<i>me...</i>

83
00:09:28,245 --> 00:09:31,405
<i>ha...</i>

84
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:37,085
<i>me...</i>

85
00:09:40,755 --> 00:09:42,585
<i>Ha</i>!!

86
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:16,125
Father!

87
00:10:40,145 --> 00:10:42,945
Gohan, you're awake?

88
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:45,405
F-Father,

89
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,945
I'm embarrassed to have fallen asleep.

90
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:49,615
Gohan,

91
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:53,165
the gravity is ten times greater
during the afternoon, it's 50°,

92
00:10:53,205 --> 00:10:55,785
while at night, it's minus 40°,

93
00:10:55,825 --> 00:11:00,455
and under these terrible conditions,
we have to train for a whole year.

94
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:03,625
That has to be tough
for a child like yourself.

95
00:11:03,665 --> 00:11:05,465
When it's time for you
to rest, it's okay to rest!

96
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:11,635
I-I've rested long enough.
Father, please train me!

97
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:18,355
Father, please!

98
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:22,025
I'm in a hurry to become a
Super Saiyan, like you, Father!

99
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:33,865
When I first came in here,
I didn't have your high spirits.

100
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,875
Gohan, you ready?

101
00:11:38,915 --> 00:11:39,995
Yes!

102
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:12,575
<i>W-Why? He's not supposed to be an</i>
<i>opponent worthy of me to begin with...</i>

103
00:12:12,615 --> 00:12:14,575
<i>What the hell has happened?</i>

104
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:18,245
<i>W-Why has Vegeta's</i>
<i>power risen to this extent?</i>

105
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,715
T-This sort of thing...

106
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:13,045
D-Dammit, this sort of
thing can't be happening!

107
00:13:15,385 --> 00:13:17,345
You stupid scum!

108
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:22,515
I'm... not going to let this folly take place!!

109
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,165
<i>It's overwhelming.</i>

110
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:46,705
<i>There's too much difference in their powers.</i>

111
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:50,875
<i>There is a new history being made,</i>
<i>entirely different from our own history.</i>

112
00:13:53,085 --> 00:13:55,505
I-Is that...

113
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:57,385
Trunks?

114
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,385
He has become quite a bit more brawny.

115
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,185
I hardly recognized him.

116
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:03,555
For him to become like this in just one day,

117
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:08,225
it must mean that Room of Spirit and
Time or whatever is one awesome room.

118
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:11,945
Okay, raise your right leg high, now!

119
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:14,365
One-two, one-two...

120
00:14:14,405 --> 00:14:16,945
We currently have nothing further to report...

121
00:14:16,985 --> 00:14:19,785
Let your day continue to be tranquil, with...

122
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,415
What's the deal?

123
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:25,085
Nobody has any more
news about what's happening.

124
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:28,415
Ten-<i>san</i>, how are you doing?

125
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:34,385
My Goku-<i>sa</i> is around, so you can relax!

126
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:38,305
My Goku-<i>sa</i> is sure to be
managin' somethin' or other!

127
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:41,975
I want Ten-<i>san</i> to hang in there too.

128
00:14:44,185 --> 00:14:47,065
Still, isn't that the
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i> we all know?

129
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:50,355
He has completely maintained his composure!

130
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,445
Nothin' too fantastic about it.

131
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:57,615
At best, he's just havin' some
kind of lewd dream or somethin'.

132
00:15:01,365 --> 00:15:05,165
Goku-<i>sa</i>, don't be worryin' about
what comes after, just stick with it!

133
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,915
I have to get you to settle this quickly,

134
00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:10,295
and then let Gohan-<i>chan</i>
get to studyin', after all!

135
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,295
Gohan sure does have himself quite a mother.

136
00:15:13,335 --> 00:15:16,795
Don't he? Everyone says so!

137
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,485
Take this!

138
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:10,855
Have you run away?

139
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,735
It will be you that dies!

140
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:22,695
I will now savor the greatest feast of all!

141
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:31,415
That's kind of you to say,
but I'm most unpalatable!

142
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,455
I'm going to suck you!

143
00:17:00,235 --> 00:17:03,195
You expect me to become your fodder?

144
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,755
This will do fine.

145
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:22,545
At this rate, once Dad defeats Cell,

146
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:25,135
it won't matter what
becomes of No. 16 and No. 18.

147
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:29,805
We won't even need the help
of Son Goku-<i>san</i> and Gohan-<i>san.</i>

148
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:32,805
Incredible!

149
00:17:37,355 --> 00:17:39,145
There's no comparison!

150
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:10,765
Come!

151
00:18:35,205 --> 00:18:37,495
<i>Where are you hiding yourself?</i>

152
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:38,765
Dammit! Where are you?!

153
00:20:35,695 --> 00:20:38,955
It would appear as if you have
received quite a shock, huh Cell?

154
00:20:38,995 --> 00:20:42,375
Why don't I tell you of an
even further shocking fact?

155
00:20:43,995 --> 00:20:46,835
Over there is a guy named Trunks.

156
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:55,975
Though not to the same extent as myself,

157
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:59,345
he also possesses a power close to mine!

158
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:09,525
It seems that even with you
putting out all the power you've got,

159
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:12,655
this is what your level is.

160
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:15,995
How damned disappointing! You pantywaist!

161
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:19,365
Here I came, wondering what
an exceptional guy you must be...

162
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:25,205
But now, somehow killing you
has become such a frivolous matter!

163
00:21:43,555 --> 00:21:46,525
Damn it to hell!!

164
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:50,355
Damn it all to hell!!

165
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:51,565
My perfect form...

166
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:54,695
if only I could become my perfect form!

167
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:58,075
That sort of guy wouldn't be so...

168
00:21:58,115 --> 00:22:03,205
Damn! Lousy No. 18! Where are you?!

169
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:06,745
No. 18?! Is she here?

170
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:12,715
<i>Cell is absolutely no match before</i>
<i>the overwhelming strength of Vegeta.</i>

171
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:19,175
<i>For him to become his perfect form,</i>
<i>he must absorb Artificial Human No. 18.</i>

172
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:24,355
<i>However, Cell has not</i>
<i>realized that No. 18 is right nearby.</i>

173
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:29,975
Damn it all! Damn it all!!

174
00:22:43,665 --> 00:22:47,665
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

175
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:53,505
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

176
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:55,885
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

177
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:04,345
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

178
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,855
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

179
00:23:10,895 --> 00:23:14,985
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

180
00:23:15,025 --> 00:23:18,485
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

181
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:21,115
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

182
00:23:22,865 --> 00:23:28,625
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

183
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,715
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

184
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:34,545
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

185
00:23:34,585 --> 00:23:38,545
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

186
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:44,225
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

187
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:46,395
<i>So sorry.</i>

188
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:51,515
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

189
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:59,565
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

190
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:11,955
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

191
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:14,965
<i>Vegeta is planning to wait for</i>
<i>Cell to achieve his perfect form.</i>

192
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:16,215
<i>He's gotta be kidding!</i>

193
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:19,255
<i>I have to use this controller</i>
<i>to somehow destroy No. 18</i>

194
00:24:19,295 --> 00:24:23,135
<i>before Cell spots me!</i>
<i>Now is my only chance.</i>

195
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,425
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

196
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:29,765
<i>"I'm So Distraught!!</i>
<i>Kuririn's Handiwork in Destroying No. 18."</i>

197
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:34,315
<i>Kuririn is susceptible to women.</i>
<i>I wonder if he'll be all right.</i>

198
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:35,935
"Next time"
"I'm So Distraught!!
Kuririn's Handiwork in Destroying No. 18"
