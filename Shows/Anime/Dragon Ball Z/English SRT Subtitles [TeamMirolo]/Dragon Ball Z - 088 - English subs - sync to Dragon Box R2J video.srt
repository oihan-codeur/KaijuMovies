Your Ma is comin' to save you right now!

00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:57,045
Say there, Chichi<i>-san,</i>
won't you please re-think this?

26
00:03:57,085 --> 00:04:00,085
Planet Namek will be dangerous for you.

27
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:04,415
He's right! Let's leave
all of this up to Son-in-law!

28
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:07,555
My Bulma<i>-chan</i> is there with him.

No! I'm goin'!

31
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:19,105
After all, you can bet Goku<i>-sa</i> ain't makin'
Gohan<i>-chan</i> do his homework properly!

00:04:20,475 --> 00:04:22,335
Yajirobe!

33
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,905
I've brung a message from Karin<i>-sama.</i>

'Parently Piccolo got to Namek all right.

Piccolo?!

If he hangs around with the likes of him,
Gohan<i>-chan</i> will become a delinquent!

I can't dawdle around any longer!

Let go of me! Let me go!

00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:56,065
The repairs to the spaceship
aren't likely finished yet!

00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:59,035
That kinda thing takes a lotta time!

41
00:04:59,075 --> 00:05:00,415
That's right!

42
00:05:21,465 --> 00:05:24,965
Ah, here, everyone's all together!

43
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:29,435
The third time around, I could handle
it without even looking at the blueprints.

44
00:05:29,475 --> 00:05:33,075
Well, Chichi<i>-san</i>, the repairs
on the spaceship are finished.

45
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:36,445
I can have you take off any time.

46
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:45,755
I-Is there something...?

47
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:48,085
There's no other way, is there?

48
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:51,095
We can't very well let Chichi<i>-san</i> go alone.

49
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:54,465
At this point, we all go together...

50
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:04,535
Listen here! If we all put our efforts together,

51
00:06:04,575 --> 00:06:08,745
we just may be of help
to Goku and the others!

52
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:13,085
Why'd ya need me too?!

53
00:06:59,095 --> 00:07:02,725
You seem to be much stronger than I thought.

54
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:04,765
I'm a little surprised.

55
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:06,405
To think that there
was someone in the world

56
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:09,275
who could reach even
higher than Commander Ginyu...

57
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:13,445
But you are still no match for me.

58
00:07:13,485 --> 00:07:15,075
Maybe not.

59
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:18,105
But we just don't know!

60
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:22,125
I know!

61
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:37,235
Right back at you!

62
00:07:56,995 --> 00:08:00,295
<i>He's escaped from my Kiai-Ho!</i>

63
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,425
<i>Damn!</i>

64
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:36,755
Hurry and come back up!

65
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:40,465
It'll take more than that to beat you.

66
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:50,835
<i>That rat has incredible speed as well.</i>

67
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,375
<i>So, now what do I do?</i>

68
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:10,155
<i>He can't find his opponent by just</i>
<i>feeling out their ki, the way we can.</i>

69
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:14,195
<i>He's always used his eyes to locate me.</i>

70
00:09:14,235 --> 00:09:17,435
<i>All right, let's make use of that!</i>

71
00:09:21,745 --> 00:09:26,545
W-What's wrong? Goku still hasn't come up!

72
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:31,455
It's okay! Father's <i>ki</i>
hasn't diminished one bit!

73
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:37,015
<i>You know, it's been a</i>
<i>while since I've done this.</i>

74
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:40,755
<i>I wonder if Old Man Turtle Hermit is doing okay.</i>

75
00:09:40,795 --> 00:09:48,725
<i>Ka... me... ha... me...</i>

76
00:09:48,765 --> 00:09:50,735
<i>Ha!</i>

77
00:09:55,805 --> 00:09:58,775
<i>Okay, just like that, just like that!</i>

78
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:12,685
What's the matter? Not ready yet?

79
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:16,085
And here I was about to deliver a final blow...

80
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,095
<i>I guess we're just about ready.</i>

81
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:26,765
<i>All right, here goes!</i>

82
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:29,275
<i>Off you go!</i>

83
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:35,945
Here he comes!

84
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,915
That's not him!

85
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:39,615
<i>And the other</i>!

86
00:10:40,455 --> 00:10:42,415
This way?

87
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:43,785
No!

88
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:10,205
Father!

89
00:11:34,745 --> 00:11:37,075
A great success!

90
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:12,105
Huh? He ain't the least bit affected?

91
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:41,905
To think that you could do this much.

92
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:46,605
You're the first one aside from my
father who I've had to dust off after.

93
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:56,045
This might be the first time
I've ever been this excited.

94
00:12:56,085 --> 00:12:58,515
How shall I dish this out?

95
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:00,755
You got me!

96
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:04,955
I thought that would have at
least had some effect on you.

97
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,605
I think I'll torment him a little...

98
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:13,625
<i>That bastard! This is telekinesis!</i>

99
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,575
Dammit!

100
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:36,245
Okay, if that's how it is...

101
00:15:00,945 --> 00:15:03,285
You are impudent!

102
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:01,905
What is this?!

103
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,905
I-It's like a whole island!

104
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:06,905
An island is floating there!

105
00:16:06,945 --> 00:16:08,775
Goku!

106
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:28,635
This is the end for sure.

107
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:34,225
You've fallen for it!

108
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:35,925
Oh, hell!

109
00:17:46,615 --> 00:17:50,575
<i>I... can't... move...!</i>

110
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:52,945
This serves you right!

111
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:14,095
When I miss, you're finished!

112
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:20,285
<i>If I don't somehow find my way out of this...!</i>

113
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:32,755
We're just about at Game Set!

114
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:34,285
Are you getting tired of this?

115
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:36,285
What?!

116
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,625
You might die this time, huh?

117
00:19:20,675 --> 00:19:21,975
Gohan!

118
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:29,275
Ah, Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

119
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:05,245
<i>Goku...</i>

120
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:08,245
<i>Father...</i>

121
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:12,885
What kind of guys are these?!

122
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:15,585
Freeza's just playing around!

123
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:22,225
If he felt like it, he's got the
power to destroy this whole planet.

124
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:26,895
And yet, seeing as how
we're all still alive here...

125
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,905
It means he really is just playing around, huh?

126
00:20:29,945 --> 00:20:31,935
What a punk he is!

127
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:39,575
Piccolo<i>-san</i>, what about Father...?

128
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,745
There's no use worrying!

129
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:44,275
That jerk hasn't gotten serious yet either!

130
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:47,285
Look over there!

131
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,265
Father!

132
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:04,375
That was a little too close.

133
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:08,745
I'll have to be on guard against that attack.

134
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,065
Didn't I tell you earlier?

135
00:21:30,105 --> 00:21:33,265
Don't bust other people's planets up so much!

136
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:40,235
Goku... But how?

137
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,875
At the moment of the explosion,

138
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,575
he escaped from being
bound up in there at super-speed.

139
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:50,145
He did something that
incredible? In that instant?

140
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:54,155
They're freaks! Both of them, dammit!

141
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:56,425
You're a persistent one!

142
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:59,595
Even I am starting to get annoyed.

143
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:01,295
So am I.

144
00:22:03,975 --> 00:22:06,935
I think I'll put an end to all this warming up,

145
00:22:06,975 --> 00:22:10,465
and finally get serious about this.

146
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:13,075
Me too.

147
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:15,575
<i>A clash of technique against technique!</i>

148
00:22:15,615 --> 00:22:18,245
<i>Explosive power versus power!</i>

149
00:22:18,285 --> 00:22:26,855
<i>However, to Goku and Freeza,</i>
<i>is this no more than simple warming up?</i>

150
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:48,175
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

151
00:22:48,215 --> 00:22:54,015
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

152
00:22:54,055 --> 00:22:56,385
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

153
00:22:59,855 --> 00:23:04,885
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

154
00:23:07,195 --> 00:23:11,395
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

155
00:23:11,435 --> 00:23:15,505
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

156
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:18,975
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

157
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:21,605
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

158
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:29,155
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

159
