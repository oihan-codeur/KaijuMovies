<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,220
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:52,100

<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,410
Unless you show your true power soon,

17
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,910
nothing else is going to mend matters.

18
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,590

S-Son Gohan...

20
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,600
Set your spirit free to your
anger. I know how it feels.

21
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,230
You just can't take it any longer.

22
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,610
Nature, and the animals that I, too, liked...

23
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,860
D-Defend them for me...

24
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,370
I'm counting on you...

25
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,390
Nobody asked you, you factory defect!

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,170
<i>Goku had been waiting for this moment.</i>

27
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,000
<i>At last, Gohan's fury has erupted!</i>

28
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:13,050
<i>"Devastating True Power!!</i>
<i>The Cell Juniors Pulverized."</i>

29
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,200
W-What?!

30
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,210
I-Is that...?

31
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,580
Gohan's <i>ki</i> is rising!

32
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,920
Gohan...!

33
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,600
Good, Gohan.

34
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,390
Is that the extent of it?

35
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,610
You've committed the same
mistake that Trunks there did.

36
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,110
You cannot beat me
just by raising your power.

37
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,620
Stop it.

38
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,620
Stop it!!

39
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,290
I told you to stop it!

40
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,640
Th-That's it! That will do nicely!

41
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,330
Y-You've changed...!

42
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,390
They're monsters, all of them!

43
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,200
Chichi!

44
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,180
I'm not going to put up with you anymore.

45
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,020
So you've finally shown
your true power, have you?

46
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,350
Now things are beginning to get interesting.

47
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,190
Impossible...!

48
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,070
You took the <i>senzu</i>...?

49
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,990
Why you...!

50
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,640
We've been having all this
trouble fighting these runts,

51
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,350
and he kills one in a single blow...!

52
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,230
I-Incredible...!

53
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,270
That was incredible, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

54
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,610
I knew it!

55
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,200
G-Gohan...!

56
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,390
W-What?!

57
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,930
H-He's fast!

58
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,600
What speed! It's equal to Cell's...

59
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,560
No, it might even be greater!

60
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:28,700
Gohan, don't mind me.
Blow these guys away!

61
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,540
Do it, Gohan!

62
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,220
U-Unbelievable... How can this be?

63
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,050
What? What's goin' on?

64
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,810
C-Chichi? Have you come to?

65
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,930
Pa, where's Gohan?

66
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,270
What's happenin' with my Gohan-<i>chan</i>?

67
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,060
He's fightin'.

68
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,270
Just as he was fightin'
magnificently, the picture went out.

69
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,070
My little child is still fightin'?

70
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,450
What do you mean, magnificent?
You gotta be kiddin'!

71
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,450
I'm goin' to let Goku-<i>sa</i> have it good!

72
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,290
Shut up, Chichi!

73
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,250
Gohan is no child! Right now,
he has surpassed Goku,

74
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,420
and has become a magnificent
warrior, who's defendin' the Earth!

75
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:50,420
Your husband and son are fightin'
for peace in this world for everyone!

76
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,800
Why can't you understand that?!

77
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,100
For my part, I'd wanna
be fightin' too, ordinarily.

78
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,270
But right now, Gohan's the
only one who can defeat Cell!

79
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,520
Okay? Understand, would you?

80
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,810
Just be quiet and pray for Gohan's safety.

81
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,560
That's all there is, huh?

82
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,280
That's all you've got to say?!

83
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,570
C-Chichi...

84
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,290
Why, you... Pa...

85
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,290
You're too permissive!

86
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,670
You're the one who
doesn't understand nothin', Pa!

87
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,380
Even if he does save the Earth,
he won't get into a good school!

88
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,460
He'll never be a decent scholar!

89
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,840
Even if he does beat Cell,

90
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,220
he'll lose when competin'
with the rest of the world!

91
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,390
H-Hold on, Chichi! C-Calm down!

92
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,220
Shut up!

93
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,020
What's so magnificent about Gohan,
now that he's gone delinquent?!

94
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:49,520
Goku-<i>sa</i>, you idiot!
Give me back my Gohan-<i>chan</i>!

95
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,250
<i>So that's it, huh?</i>

96
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,080
<i>That's the power of his anger? Fine, then.</i>

97
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,750
<i>Let's have a good long look at it.</i>

98
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,700
I-I'm not the center of attention...
This is ridiculous.

99
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,410
The video I set up to record will be worthless.

100
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,410
Should this get out to the
rest of the world? No, it must not!

101
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,460
H-He can beat him...

102
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,250
He just might be able to beat him...!

103
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,130
People of the world, this is a surprise!

104
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,130
That young boy is fighting
effectively against those miniature Cells!

105
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,130
Make sure you're getting all of this!

106
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,430
It's impossible. Not with this.

107
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,310
What?! This is the scoop of the century!
You're a pro, fix it somehow!

108
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:33,400
He blew away those Cell Juniors with
nothing more than a blast of his <i>Kiai</i>...!

109
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,900
A-And what's more, even after
displaying that level of fighting,

110
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,400
he's not the least bit winded!

111
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,570
Are you all right, Son?!

112
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,420
What do you think, Piccolo?
Just like I said, right?

113
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,420
Gohan...

114
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,200
I told you, there's no way
I'm putting up with you anymore!

115
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,510
Let yourself get carried away, will you...?!

116
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,690
There's no longer any
irresolution or hesitation within him.

117
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,570
His anger is governing his emotions.
He is the mightiest warrior.

118
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:10,450
That's what you get, Cell! You blew it!

119
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,950
Give these to everyone.

120
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,910
Right.

121
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,960
<i>Gohan is displaying overwhelming strength.</i>

122
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,840
<i>However, Cell is still concealing</i>
<i>the depth of his power.</i>

123
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,510
<i>Will the victor end up being Cell or Gohan?</i>

124
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,540
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

125
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:54,380
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

126
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,760
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

127
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,230
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

128
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,730
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

129
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,860
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

130
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,370
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

131
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,990
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

132
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:29,500
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

133
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,590
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

134
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,420
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

135
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,430
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

136
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:45,100
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

137
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,270
<i>So sorry.</i>

138
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:52,400
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

139
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,450
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

140
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,920
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

141
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,720
<i>It don't matter how much</i>
<i>you raise your power now.</i>

142
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,050
<i>Cell, you ain't no match for Gohan!</i>

143
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:22,890
<i>I-Impossible! How could</i>
<i>I have taken this much damage...</i>

144
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,390
<i>from just two punches?!</i>

145
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,390
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

146
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,110
<i>"Cell gets KO'ed!!</i>
<i>Just 2 Super Ironfisted Blows."</i>

147
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,070
<i>Here it comes, Cell! This will</i>
<i>show you the pain you've caused!</i>

148
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:38,070
"Next time"

Just 2 Super Ironfisted Blows"
