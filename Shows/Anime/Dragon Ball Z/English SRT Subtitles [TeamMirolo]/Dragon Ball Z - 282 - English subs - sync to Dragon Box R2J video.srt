00:00:20,485 --> 00:00:24,655
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:30,285
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:36,005
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:41,675
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:48,935
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:54,685
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:57,275
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:00,155
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:03,025
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,575
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,615 --> 00:01:08,575
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:11,575
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:14,245
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

14
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:20,125
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,165 --> 00:01:23,005
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,595
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:28,595
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,975
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:34,185
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:37,025
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,065 --> 00:01:39,815
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,855 --> 00:01:46,075
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:13,845
<i>The fierce, final battle between</i>
<i>Goku and Majin Boo continued.</i>

24
00:02:13,885 --> 00:02:19,185
<i>However, not even Goku's arduous</i>
<i>attacks were of any use against Boo.</i>

25
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,945
Here I'm wanting to obliterate him,

26
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:28,365
but I have to gather <i>ki</i>
for about a whole minute.

27
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:32,575
All right! I'll keep him in
check somehow for one minute.

28
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:34,495
You start gathering <i>ki</i> immediately!

29
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,915
<i>As Goku gathered up his ki,</i>

30
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:43,835
<i>Vegeta took his place,</i>
<i>risking his life to fight Boo.</i>

31
00:02:43,875 --> 00:02:46,845
<i>However, even after the</i>
<i>necessary one minute had gone by,</i>

32
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,255
<i>Goku's ki had not been stored up.</i>

33
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:51,425
<i>What in the world is the matter, Goku?</i>

34
00:02:56,225 --> 00:03:01,275
<i>"Don't You Pick On Satan!!</i>
<i>The Original Boo is Revived."</i>

35
00:03:31,635 --> 00:03:36,765
This is strange... I should have
long since had enough <i>ki</i> gathered...

36
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:00,995
Vegeta!

37
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:18,035
Hey, there! Where are you planning on going?

38
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:22,455
It's obvious, isn't it? I am
returning to the Kaioshin Realm.

39
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,625
Y-You're what?

40
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:27,625
Unquestionably, between Majin Boo and I,

41
00:05:27,665 --> 00:05:31,045
there is too much difference in our
powers, and I will be no match for him.

42
00:05:31,085 --> 00:05:36,635
However, even I should be
able to buy them some time.

43
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:40,725
At this point, even if it's only for one second,

44
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:44,895
we have to buy enough time to
let Goku-<i>san</i> gather even more <i>ki.</i>

45
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:48,645
Right now, Goku-<i>san</i> is
our only remaining hope.

46
00:05:48,685 --> 00:05:49,985
Just a minute!

47
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:52,985
I'm going too!

48
00:05:53,025 --> 00:05:54,775
Not you, too!

49
00:05:54,815 --> 00:06:00,445
I am not a fighter-type, but
even so, I should be of some use!

50
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:06,795
Dende-<i>san...</i>

51
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,625
This is a crisis for the whole universe.

52
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:13,925
At a time like this, I can't
just sit here doing nothing!

53
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:16,385
Thanks!

54
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:17,715
Well then, let's go!

55
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,385
Right!

56
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:22,055
J-J-Just a moment, now!

57
00:06:25,435 --> 00:06:29,145
For the love of... would
you settle down for a second?

58
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:33,945
If you boys could go and buy time,
I would have long since let you go!

59
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:36,735
You boys must know well enough

60
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:41,825
that this situation is one where
we can no longer do anything!

61
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:49,295
I know how you're feeling anxious,
but there's nothing we can do any more.

62
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:51,755
The only thing we can do...

63
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:55,295
is believe in those two,
and watch over them.

64
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:59,715
Knowing those two, I'm sure they'll
manage something. Isn't that right?

65
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:35,045
Vegeta!

66
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:39,845
Stay back...!

67
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:58,315
Stay back! Of all the...

68
00:07:58,355 --> 00:08:02,115
Who is it you think I'm
going through all of this for?!

69
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:07,075
You hurry up and gather your <i>ki</i>!

70
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,395
This is bad!

71
00:08:33,435 --> 00:08:37,355
No matter how tough Vegeta is,
there ain't no way he can stand up to that!

72
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:51,495
I can't stand it any more!

73
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:52,745
Boo!

74
00:08:56,125 --> 00:09:00,385
Yo, yo, yo! I watch on silently, and
you get carried away with yourself!

75
00:09:00,425 --> 00:09:04,005
Did you think that the world combat
sports champion Mister Satan-<i>sama</i>

76
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:07,715
would quietly overlook your brutality?!

77
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,815
I am going to punish you! Prepare yourself!

78
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:26,655
You will soon regret having an
opponent you can't deal with!

79
00:09:28,995 --> 00:09:33,075
We didn't need this! He should
have just quietly stayed in hiding!

80
00:10:01,525 --> 00:10:04,355
<i>He's nervous, he's nervous!</i>

81
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:12,825
You're getting a spankie spankie!

82
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:22,085
Yo, yo, yo! What's the matter?!
Hurry up and come at me!

83
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:26,095
Or are you afraid of Mister Satan here?

84
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:29,515
You miserable coward!

85
00:10:29,555 --> 00:10:36,225
<i>I-I nailed that! I nailed that so</i>
<i>hard, it's a shame this is a dream!</i>

86
00:10:42,565 --> 00:10:44,235
Y-You want to go?!

87
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:52,745
E-Even in a dream, this is scary!

88
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,575
I-I'm sorry!

89
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:05,635
I-I didn't mean any harm!
I just wanted to show off a little!

90
00:11:05,675 --> 00:11:08,505
I was only playing around,
and I couldn't help myself!

91
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:11,505
Satan dodged Boo's attack!

92
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:15,685
Nice going! I have to
give you more credit, Satan!

93
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:17,935
I'm so sorry!

94
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:51,715
W-What is it? What in the world is wrong?!

95
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:05,685
C-Could it be that he's in awe of my resolve?

96
00:12:09,235 --> 00:12:12,785
I did it, I did it! I did it!

97
00:12:12,825 --> 00:12:15,655
Yo, yo, what's the matter?!

98
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:23,165
Come on, come on! Suffer some
more from the power of my resolve!

99
00:12:24,795 --> 00:12:27,715
<i>W-Why is this?</i>

100
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:31,135
<i>Why is it that ever since Mister</i>
<i>Satan appeared, Boo has been...?</i>

101
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:33,765
<i>C-Could it really be a result</i>
<i>of Mister Satan's resolve?</i>

102
00:12:33,805 --> 00:12:36,515
K-Kakarrot!

103
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,305
What the hell are you doing?!

104
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:43,775
This is our chance! Gather
your <i>ki</i> now, while you can!

105
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:46,315
Yeah, you got it!

106
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:10,715
B-B-Boo!!

107
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:35,735
W-What's this?

108
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:39,615
W-What's happening here?

109
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:45,455
I-I know! That chubby Majin Boo
was friends with Mister Satan!

110
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,755
With that Boo inside his body,

111
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:52,085
he was undergoing rejection, and
was incapable of attacking Satan!

112
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:57,675
I see, so that's why he spat him out, is it?

113
00:13:57,715 --> 00:14:02,765
Well, even if that Satan fellow is
done in, it won't have much of an impact.

114
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:07,645
H-How could you? He may
have a number of character issues,

115
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:11,445
but he is the last survivor of the human race...

116
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,895
for the time being...

117
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,705
Boo!

118
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,585
Boo! Hey! Come on!

119
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,875
Snap out of it! Boo!

120
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,175
Boo...

121
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:42,765
Hey, come on...

122
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:44,975
B-Boo...

123
00:14:48,645 --> 00:14:53,985
B-Boo... And you were such a nice guy, too...

124
00:14:55,155 --> 00:14:58,985
How... How awful...!

125
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:08,625
How dare you do this to Boo!
You'll pay! You're going to pay!!

126
00:15:08,665 --> 00:15:10,665
Why, you...! Brace yourself!

127
00:15:10,705 --> 00:15:14,625
I, Mister Satan, will beat you to a pulp!

128
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:19,595
W-What's with this guy?

129
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:24,765
You really want to fight?!
I'm warning you, y-you'd better quit!

130
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:28,015
To put it frankly, I'm too strong for you!

131
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:37,775
V-Very well!

132
00:15:37,815 --> 00:15:41,945
If you want to get hurt
that badly, I'll let you have it!

133
00:15:41,985 --> 00:15:43,695
Come on!

134
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:50,665
<i>This is my dream, after all...</i>

135
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:54,795
<i>So it's only natural that</i>
<i>I'm the one who will win!</i>

136
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,615
How's that? Have you learned your lesson?

137
00:16:31,665 --> 00:16:35,255
H-How can this be?!
Even in my dream, this still hurts!

138
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:59,105
W-Why, you...! Cut that out!

139
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:01,735
Are you trying to get me really angry?!

140
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:04,575
Do you really want to get hurt that badly?

141
00:17:04,615 --> 00:17:07,615
If you're going to apologize, now's the time!

142
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:28,885
W-Well, that's okay!
Maybe I'll just let you off. Mm-hmm!

143
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:33,555
I might have been partly in the wrong as well.

144
00:17:59,505 --> 00:18:00,965
What?!

145
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:21,775
B-Boo...

146
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:31,785
I hate you! Don't you pick on Satan!

147
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:36,495
Boo! Y-You're alive?

148
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:48,595
How long is this going to take,
Kakarrot?! Still not yet?!

149
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:53,515
I-I know! But it's strange...

150
00:18:53,555 --> 00:19:01,185
I've gathered up <i>ki</i> to just about my full power,
b-but the stored-up <i>ki</i> is starting to decrease!

151
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,185
I-It's what?!

152
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:10,505
Kakarrot, enough already!
How long will this take?!

153
00:20:10,545 --> 00:20:13,635
That fatso isn't going to hold out that long!

154
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:19,555
Aren't you done yet?!
Aren't you done gathering up your <i>ki</i>?!

155
00:20:23,145 --> 00:20:27,775
Damn it! Damn it! This ain't...

156
00:20:27,815 --> 00:20:30,115
This ain't supposed to be happening!

157
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:36,825
M-My power... My power is d-dropping off!

158
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:44,125
W-What's this?!

159
00:20:50,885 --> 00:20:53,005
Th-This can't be...!

160
00:21:06,725 --> 00:21:08,275
Boo...!

161
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,505
Th-Thank goodness!

162
00:21:27,545 --> 00:21:33,885
That's my Boo! Hang in there!
Bust that guy's chops!

163
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:39,845
Th-This is trouble. I can't really win.

164
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:50,565
Looks like this has
become the worst of all games.

165
00:22:10,255 --> 00:22:14,755
<i>Far from storing up ki,</i>
<i>Goku has instead powered down.</i>

166
00:22:14,795 --> 00:22:17,885
<i>Is there no way left to defeat Boo?</i>

167
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:21,675
<i>The universe is meeting its greatest crisis!</i>

168
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:38,945
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

169
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:45,535
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

170
00:22:49,795 --> 00:22:56,135
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

171
00:22:56,175 --> 00:23:02,225
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

172
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:09,225
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

173
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:14,605
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

174
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:18,485
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

175
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:27,535
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

176
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,085
<i>Even now?</i>

177
00:23:29,125 --> 00:23:36,715
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

178
00:23:36,755 --> 00:23:42,135
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

179
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:48,605
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

180
00:23:48,645 --> 00:23:58,655
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

181
00:24:13,705 --> 00:24:15,755
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

182
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:18,215
<i>The way things are headed,</i>
<i>the chubby Boo is done for!</i>

183
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:20,715
<i>Super Saiyan 3 ain't</i>
<i>getting the job done, either!</i>

184
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:24,595
<i>Dende, Kaioshin, bring back</i>
<i>Earth right now with the Dragon Balls!</i>

185
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:27,645
<i>It's time the people of</i>
<i>earth pulled their own weight!</i>

186
00:24:27,685 --> 00:24:29,725
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

187
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:33,565
<i>"Vegeta's Secret Plan!!</i>
<i>Polunga and the Two Wishes."</i>

188
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,435
<i>All right! Everyone has come back to life!</i>

189
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,735
