<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

2
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:24,765
<i>As a panorama spreads itself</i>
<i>throughout my being!</i>

3
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:30,035
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

4
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:36,775
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

7
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,725
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,765 --> 00:01:04,735
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,205
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,245 --> 00:01:14,315
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,715
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:26,665
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,705 --> 00:01:30,235
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:37,105
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:28,355
<i>In order to return Chichi and the others</i>
<i>who had become demonic back to normal,</i>

17
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:31,695
<i>Gohan and Kuririn headed off to</i>
<i>the Temple of the Heavenly Realm.</i>

18
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,565
<i>However, there was already</i>
<i>someone there waiting to face them.</i>

19
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:37,695
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

20
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:39,705
We meet again, kid.

21
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:43,205
You're faster than we thought,
I'll give you credit for that.

22
00:02:43,245 --> 00:02:45,375
Dammit.

23
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,745
They got Piccolo<i>-san</i> too.

24
00:02:55,155 --> 00:03:01,455
<i>"Direct Confrontation with Piccolo!!</i>
<i>An Angry Masenko in the Heavenly Realm."</i>

25
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,665
Even your beloved Piccolo<i>-san</i> here...

26
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:13,665
...has become Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i>'s
obedient servant.

27
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:15,975
He has become one of us Demon Clansmen!

28
00:03:17,045 --> 00:03:19,845
Just like your mother has.

29
00:03:23,385 --> 00:03:26,015
Son of Son Goku...

30
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:29,015
...or, as I recall, you have the name Gohan...

31
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:31,855
...I have a question for you.

32
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:36,125
It's a simple question. You'll answer me, yes?

33
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:57,315
Where is your father?

34
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:59,275
Father?

35
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:05,015
That's right! Son Goku, the
man foolish enough to oppose me!

36
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,355
You and your father caused
me to suffer a severe disgrace.

37
00:04:08,395 --> 00:04:12,025
I intend to take that humiliation
and return it to you many times over.

38
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:13,025
What?!

39
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:15,695
The world is already in the palm of my hand.

40
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:18,695
However, without taking revenge against you,

41
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,575
I cannot declare my victory complete.

42
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:32,045
So, tell me, where is Son Goku?
Where is he hiding himself?

43
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,985
Why hasn't he shown himself?

44
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,015
Father is neither running nor hiding!

45
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:41,685
He just doesn't know
you bad guys are around!

46
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:45,025
He doesn't know? How do you mean?

47
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:46,225
I'm going to...

48
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:54,235
I'm going to take care of you!

49
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:04,945
If you don't want to talk, that's fine too.

50
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:14,165
As long as you're around,
Son Goku will show himself eventually.

51
00:05:33,085 --> 00:05:36,245
You... miserable... brat!

52
00:05:50,335 --> 00:05:55,725
You brat! Your power is not greater than mine!

53
00:05:55,765 --> 00:05:57,935
What was that power just now?

54
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:23,395
Father!

55
00:06:39,075 --> 00:06:42,315
You won't get away with this!
I will not let you get away with this!

56
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:53,395
If you can shoot him, then go ahead!

57
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:03,355
If Kami here dies, Piccolo dies too.
So long as you don't mind.

58
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:11,075
Kami<i>-sama...</i>

59
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:38,065
Gohan!

60
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:40,035
Whoa, there!

61
00:07:40,075 --> 00:07:42,305
I will be your opponent!

62
00:08:02,765 --> 00:08:09,695
Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i>, can I ask that
you leave these two up to us?

63
00:08:09,735 --> 00:08:11,295
Wait just a moment.

64
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:35,055
Very well. Until Son Goku arrives,
you may thoroughly amuse yourselves.

65
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:37,725
However...

66
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:42,605
I strike the finishing blow.
Hurt them, but do not kill them!

67
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:46,035
You hear that?

68
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:49,405
He's given us his permission! Get ready, kid!

69
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:55,675
Hey! Save some of that for us, too!

70
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:58,675
Don't get reckless and kill them, now!

71
00:08:58,715 --> 00:09:02,385
Yeah, I'll try to be as careful as I can.

72
00:09:08,395 --> 00:09:12,695
Well, kid, bring it on!

73
00:09:12,735 --> 00:09:17,395
As for you, the previous Kami<i>-sama,</i>
feel free to observe this as well.

74
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:23,035
What's the matter, kid?

75
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:26,175
If you aren't going to start this, then I will!

76
00:09:33,055 --> 00:09:35,015
Gohan!

77
00:09:35,055 --> 00:09:38,155
Whoa, I told you that
I was going to fight you!

78
00:09:46,735 --> 00:09:48,665
What's wrong with you?

79
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:51,175
Is this all the power you have?

80
00:10:02,085 --> 00:10:05,975
Come now, you're
supposed to be Son Goku's son.

81
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:09,425
Don't you die from just that!

82
00:10:10,025 --> 00:10:11,425
Gohan...

83
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,605
Gohan!

84
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:33,045
Hey, what's the matter, let's get going!

85
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:39,275
I see, you've already had it.

86
00:10:39,315 --> 00:10:41,725
In that case, I'll just finish you off!

87
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:47,455
Gohan!

88
00:10:54,665 --> 00:10:55,925
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

89
00:10:55,965 --> 00:10:57,235
You fool!

90
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,405
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

91
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:31,535
A-one, two, three, four,
and one, two, three, four,

92
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:34,505
A little more, one, two,
one, two, and three, four...

93
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:38,135
This side, the other side, a-one, two...

94
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,805
How lucky you had these
clothes in a place such as this!

95
00:11:40,845 --> 00:11:46,145
One, two, ah, they're so nice!
A-three, four, a-one, two...

96
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,285
I hope you like them.

97
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:51,485
If you need anything else, just tell me.

98
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,485
I am a great, great sage after all.

99
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,155
I sure will!

100
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:06,905
Say, Yajirobe, this young miss...

101
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:09,905
...doesn't seem to be paying me
quite enough respect, does she?

102
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:13,575
Quite enough? She ain't payin' none at all.

103
00:12:13,615 --> 00:12:17,815
Um, Yajirobe and Kitty<i>-chan...</i>

104
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:22,145
Excuse me, I do have the name Karin<i>-sama.</i>

105
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,525
It doesn't matter what your name is.

106
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:31,155
I'm so hungry! Make me something.

107
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,495
Huh? Us?!

108
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:36,465
That's right. Hurry, okay?

109
00:12:38,205 --> 00:12:42,645
Sure, but, when it comes to
cookin', we, uh, that is... right?

110
00:12:50,885 --> 00:12:52,915
Pretty please?

111
00:12:57,555 --> 00:12:58,555
'Kay!

112
00:12:58,595 --> 00:13:00,215
Right away!

113
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:11,735
Hey, Yajirobe, can't we do
something about that little lady?

114
00:13:11,775 --> 00:13:14,865
You're jus' too indulgent with her, Karin<i>-sama.</i>

115
00:13:14,905 --> 00:13:16,205
Can'tcha be more tough with her?!

116
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:21,175
But I'm a kind and gentle sage.
I couldn't do that, could I?

117
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:24,845
Kind an' gentle sage, huh? Yeah, right.

118
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:30,515
Without your help, she'll
never come to respect me.

119
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:33,525
'Kay then, I'll do everythin' I can.

120
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:36,185
Excuse me, Kitty<i>-chan</i>?!

121
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,895
Yes?!

122
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:43,365
Ain't no way he can get
her to respect him like that.

123
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:11,225
Kuririn<i>-san</i>! Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

124
00:14:13,605 --> 00:14:17,235
This is from me having
slacked off in my training lately...

125
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:20,865
I couldn't move around the way I wanted to...

126
00:14:20,905 --> 00:14:22,175
Kuririn<i>-san</i>!

127
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:26,475
Gohan, never mind about me...

128
00:14:26,515 --> 00:14:30,955
You've got to get your hands on that
Ultra Holy Water by tomorrow morning...

129
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:39,285
Otherwise Piccolo, your mom, and
everyone else can't be returned to normal!

130
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:12,045
What is it? What am I lacking
to become a Super Saiyan?

131
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:18,685
<i>Why was Kakarrot able to become one?</i>

132
00:16:18,725 --> 00:16:22,055
<i>Why? That oversoft scum!</i>

133
00:16:22,095 --> 00:16:25,425
Why?!

134
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:37,705
T-This <i>ki...</i>

135
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:42,915
A Super Saiyan <i>ki...</i>

136
00:16:52,225 --> 00:16:54,215
Kakarrot?

137
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:02,895
<i>It is! I've found you at last, Kakarrot!</i>

138
00:17:19,855 --> 00:17:24,185
<i>There! On top of that rock. He's there all right!</i>

139
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:29,525
What?!

140
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:41,005
Is this all?

141
00:18:04,235 --> 00:18:06,665
What, was it an illusion?

142
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:16,165
No. That was no illusion.

143
00:18:19,545 --> 00:18:24,385
This land used to be flat, but he blew
this away with his <i>ki</i>, leaving this mountain.

144
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:35,225
The only one who could have done
this was you, Kakarrot, as a Super Saiyan!

145
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:44,495
Good. Apparently you've
raised your skill level again.

146
00:18:44,535 --> 00:18:49,035
Well I'll raise mine even higher!
You just wait, Kakarrot!

147
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:01,185
<i>Why, that kid! He's got</i>
<i>even more power than before!</i>

148
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:10,225
He's got such power!

149
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:13,225
It's no use. Let's get to it.

150
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:15,565
But Garlic Jr<i>.-sama</i>'s orders were to not–

151
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:19,865
It's nothing to worry about.
Either way, he's just as dead.

152
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,565
I guess you're right.

153
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,515
W-Why those two–

154
00:19:35,555 --> 00:19:37,425
It's all right! Let them go.

155
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:40,495
Die!

156
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:54,065
G-Gohan!

157

Gohan...

158
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:22,965
<i>Masenko</i>!

159
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:40,015
Rotten brat!

160
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:17,885
Miserable fool!

161
00:21:18,855 --> 00:21:21,195
You lousy punk!

162
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,865
Don't get too full of yourself!

163
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:27,935
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

164
00:21:56,295 --> 00:22:01,235
Most interesting. Piccolo, squash him!

165
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,935
Pic... colo<i>-san...</i>

166
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:23,915
<i>Gohan is in an utter pinch!</i>

167
00:22:23,955 --> 00:22:28,655
<i>At last, there is a direct confrontation</i>
<i>with the demonified Piccolo.</i>

168
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:48,105
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

169
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:53,945
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

170
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:56,315
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

171
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:04,825
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

172
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:11,335
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

173
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:15,435
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

174
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:18,905
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

175
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:21,535
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

176
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:29,085
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

177
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:33,185
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

178
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:34,985
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

179
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:39,025
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

180
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:44,695
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

181
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:46,865
<i>So sorry.</i>

182
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:52,005
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

183

<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

184
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:13,525
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

185
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:16,265
<i>If we don't get Kami-sama back from Garlic Jr.,</i>

186
00:24:16,305 --> 00:24:18,265
<i>Gohan and the others ain't</i>
<i>gonna be able to fight all-out.</i>

187
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:21,535
<i>At this rate, everyone on Earth</i>
<i>is gonna be turned demonic!</i>

188
00:24:21,575 --> 00:24:27,075
<i>Kami, behold as Piccolo</i>
<i>himself lays into your follower!</i>

189
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,005
