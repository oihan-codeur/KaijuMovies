00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,440
<i>Gohan had returned!</i>

28
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,410
Hey, don't tell me you intend to fight me!

29
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,910
No, I'm going to kill you!

30
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,850
You retard.

31
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,570
<i>Will the extraordinarily powered-up</i>
<i>Gohan be able to completely defeat Majin Boo,</i>

32
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,570

Retard, you say? Retard?!

35
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,280
H-He called him that?!

36
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,360
H-He's gotten too carried away, regardless!

37
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,290
Y-You called me a retard?!

38
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,410
You can't win!

39
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,140
So, that was you after all?

40
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,140
What?

41
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,300
What do you mean?

42
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,730
I knew it! Ever since I was fighting those runts!

43
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:11,760
Far, far, in a very faraway
place, I felt a strong power.

44
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,270
I will not stand for any
power stronger than mine!

45
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,850
So that's it. You were
testing me, just to make sure

46
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,270
that I really was greater than you...

47
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:31,070
That's too bad, huh Majin Boo?

48
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,070
Y-You mean that even
during the height of that battle,

49
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,490
he had already become
conscious of Gohan's existence?

50
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,460
I-In that case, what in the world was
the meaning of that fight with Gotenks?!

51
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,170
Listen, and listen well!

52
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,180
I will not stand for you! Absolutely not!

53
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:03,520
Absolutely not, absolutely not!
I won't stand for you!! I'll kill you!!

54
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,870
Kill me, you say?

55
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:32,380
You must know better than anyone
else that such a thing is impossible.

56
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,340
I'm looking forward to this!

57
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,750
Watch out!

58
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,010
I'm so thirsty...

59
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,270
B-Beer!!

60
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,530
Looks so good!

61
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,830
Hold on, hold on, I'll find some milk for you.

62
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,610
W-We owe you one, Gohan. You saved us.

63
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,620
Not at all.

64
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,450
Whew! That was close!

65
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,120
T-To think he would blow himself up!

66
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,170
Big Brother, you're incredible! Way to
know that Boo was blowing himself up!

67
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,650
Is Boo dead, then?

68
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,480
No.

69
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,650
He blew himself up, didn't he?
He tried to take you with him, Gohan-<i>san</i>!

70
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,200
If he had been trying to take me with him,

71
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,620
he would have made it even bigger–

72
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,370
so much so that there
would be nothing left of Earth.

73
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,540
What does this mean?
Has he fled? I don't feel his <i>ki</i>!

74
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,500
He is capable of muffling his <i>ki.</i>

75
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,300
S-So he's hiding,
looking for his next chance!

76
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,510
I don't know. But it does seem
as if he's planning something.

77
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:21,230
Ha! Even if he is really
alive, there's no problem!

78
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,690
That jerk was powerless to stop Gohan-<i>san</i>!

79
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,410
He's as strong as we were as Super Gotenks!

80
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,450
Even stronger!

81
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,490
Really? Yeah, just a little.

82
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,300
Tell me, Gohan, how is it
that you've become so powerful?

83
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,340
Wow, such an incredible old man, huh?

84
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,470
By the way, Piccolo-<i>san,</i>
who has the Dragon Radar?

85
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,930
Ah, we gave that to Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

86
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,930
Y-Yeah. It's true that I do have it.

87
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:45,940
However... with Dende having been killed,
the Dragon Balls are mere stones now.

88
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,190
The Dragon Balls are what?!

89
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,290
It's okay. Dende is alive. See?
You can faintly feel his <i>ki</i>, right?

90
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,540
What?!

91
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,460
I-It's true! I feel him!

92
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,260
–Yeah! I can tell too!
–He's over that way!

93
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,600
Come on! Let's go locate Dende while we can!

94
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,100
We don't know when Boo
will appear again, after all.

95
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,310
All right! Let's go!

96
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:38,120
That jerk! He really has killed everyone!
There isn't a single person anywhere!

97
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,790
Yeah...

98
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,710
What? Do you see something?

99
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,380
Yes. Isn't that...?

100
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:12,490
I-I want some beer...
water would be okay too...

101
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,490
It's Mister Satan! Why is he
the only one who has survived?

102
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,000
He's sure a tough one. Let him be, let him be!

103
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,750
No, let's bring him with us.

104
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,960
Even given all that, he's
still a good person at heart.

105
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,340
He did try to save the Earth, in his own way.

106
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,090
Juice... Cola... Oolong tea...

107
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,370
Huh? You're...!

108
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,710
Good day.

109
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,290
G-Good day...

110
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,680
Still, why is it that Dende alone survived?

111
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:26,100
Boo had plenty of time. Enough
for him to seek him out and kill him.

112
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,690
Father said that you were fighting
in the Room of Spirit and Time,

113
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,150
and that Boo was the first to come out, right?

114
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,320
That's right.

115
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,700
He broke through the wall between dimensions.

116
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,700
Even so, Piccolo-<i>san</i>, afterward you all
came out as well, almost immediately, right?

117
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,670
One day here is the same
as a year within the room,

118
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,380
so Piccolo-<i>san</i>, you and the others
came out just one moment later, didn't you?

119
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,000
Th-That's right!

120
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,550
How can this be?!

121
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,430
I got so distracted that I've
misunderstood everything! That's right!

122
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,970
It was completely the opposite!

123
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,730
You sure do get reckless
sometimes, Piccolo-<i>san</i>!

124
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,150
Th-Thanks...

125
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
Oh! Kami-<i>sama</i>!

126
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,910
Everyone!

127
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,590
How good of you to have
gotten away, Dende! Well done!

128
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,010
P-Popo-<i>san</i> said that I at
least absolutely must not die!

129
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,940
When it looked like everyone
was going to be eaten by Boo,

130
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,350
he immediately flung me
toward the Lower Realm!

131
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,030
I choose choco!!

132
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,330
Kami-<i>sama</i> at least must not die!

133
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:17,130
He was right. If you had died, the
Dragon Balls would be ordinary stones.

134
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:20,010
The Earth would have remained a ghost town.

135
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,220
That's our Mister Popo!
He's made an excellent determination!

136
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,310
H-Hey, who is he? That kid over
there with the sickly complexion?

137
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,320
Now see here! What do you mean, kid?!
That's Kami-<i>sama</i>! Kami-<i>sama</i>!

138
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
W-What did you say?

139
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,160
Whew, thank goodness!

140
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,670
Um...

141
00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,510
What are these Dragon Balls that you
have been talking about for a while now?

142
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:07,850
Never mind that, what in the
world does Majin Boo plan to do?

143
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,020
There's no way he can win!

144
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,690
W-W-W-What?!

145
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,940
V-V-Videl has been killed?!

146
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:31,540
B-Boo killed V-Videl?!
Th-Th-That can't be!! Videl! Videl!

147
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:39,710
Hey, you! Why didn't you
protect Videl?! Why didn't you?!

148
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,260
I'm sorry...

149
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,430
It's okay, Pops! They can
come back to life, after all!

150
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,060
C-Come back to life? Really?
Videl can come back to life, right?

151
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,440
Really! Really! Really!

152
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,600
You're not lying to me, are you?

153
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,600
If you're lying, I'll make
you swallow a thousand needles!

154
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,660
It's Majin Boo!

155
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,290
What?! Boo, you say?

156
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,130
Th-That can't be! Is he
already intent on fighting again?

157
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:24,010
What could have changed in
just the hour or so that has gone by?

158
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,270
I'll finish him off this time for sure!

159
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:37,440
Everyone, be careful not
to get caught in between us!

160
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,990
<i>Okay, show me what has changed!</i>

161
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,340
Boo!

162
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,510
Why have you killed everyone?!
You promised me, didn't you?

163
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,310
That you wouldn't kill any more?

164
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,650
Boo! Don't you know who I am?

165
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,360
It's no use! He's not the
same Boo he was before!

166
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:36,240
L-Look! This is the cute little guy
you saved! See how lively he's gotten?

167
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,710
I told you, it's useless! Stop it, already!

168
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,050
You'll get in the way of Gohan's fighting.

169
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,430
What does he want me to do? Damn...

170
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:09,320
Strange. I don't think there's a
single thing about him that has changed.

171
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,500
What is it with him?
What the hell is he thinking?

172
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,000
Yeesh! He's bluffing, he's bluffing!

173
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,620
He's just going to go
right off running away again!

174
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:34,050
Hey, pipsqueaks!
Come on out! I want to fight you!

175
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,060
What?

176
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,220
You've got it backward, Boo!
I'm your opponent now!

177
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,440
First I'm going to settle things with
the pipsqueaks! I'll fight you afterward!

178
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,070
Why?! Why do such a roundabout thing?
You wanted to defeat me, didn't you?!

179
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:01,120
What's the matter, pipsqueaks?
Are you afraid to fight me?

180
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,000
What happened to all those
high spirits you showed earlier?

181
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,100
<i>Once again, Majin Boo challenges</i>
<i>Trunks and Goten to a fight.</i>

182
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,230
<i>Just what exactly do you have planned?</i>

183
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,620
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

184
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:45,210
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

185
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:55,760
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

186
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,890
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

187
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:08,900
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

188
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,280
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

189
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,120
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

190
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:27,210
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

191
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,750
<i>Even now?</i>

192
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:36,380
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

193
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:41,760
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

194
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:48,270
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

195
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:58,280
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

196
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,340
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

197
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,840
<i>Oh, no! Gotenks and Piccolo</i>
<i>have been absorbed by Boo!</i>

198
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,220
<i>What do you think, Gohan-kun?</i>

199
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,730
<i>This is a moment which will never come again!</i>

200
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,190
<i>The birth of the mightiest of Majin!</i>

201
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,270
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

202
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,610
<i>"Boo's Worst Foul!! Gotenks is Absorbed!?"</i>

203
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,820
<i>That was dirty, Majin Boo!</i>

204
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,450
"Next time"
"Boo's Worst Foul!! Gotenks is Absorbed!?"
