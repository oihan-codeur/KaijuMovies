3
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,010
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>

4
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,750
<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:43,330
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

6
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:52,200
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

8
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:04,710
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

9
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,180
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,290
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

11
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,690
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

12
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:26,640
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,210
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

14
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:37,080
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,020
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,740
That there is Earth, Papa.

17
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,710
It couldn't be...

18
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,580
And yet, it surely is...

19
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,950
How can this be?!

20
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,850
This <i>ki...</i>

21
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,590
You think I could be mistaken about this?

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,230
You stupid fool!

23
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,290
It's not just one... there's
another... impossibly large <i>ki.</i>

24
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,530
Impossible!

25
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,270
I'm certain that Goku took care of Freeza!

26
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,310
<i>What's this? Freeza survived!</i>

27
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,880
<i>And now, he brings with</i>
<i>him an even greater power!</i>

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,620
<i>The Earth is now in its greatest pinch ever!</i>

29
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:01,200
<i>"I Will Defeat Freeza...</i>
<i>The Mysterious Youth Awaiting Goku."</i>

30
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,070
Why is this happening?

31
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,480
This is the worst, Father!

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,890
That's Kuririn<i>-san</i>'s <i>ki.</i>

33
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,860
Yo!

34
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,730
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, have you sensed it?

35
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,870
Yeah. But, then again...

36
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,710
There's no way I could have missed this.

37
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,580
Not after having gone
through what his <i>ki</i> did to me...

38
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,700
Die!!

39
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,260
Goku!

40
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,040
So what does this mean?

41
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,710
Freeza wasn't killed by
Father after all, Kuririn<i>-san</i>?

42
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,880
That's what I'd like to know.

43
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,050
Nothing is adding up.

44
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,050
It doesn't hurt to travel through
frontier areas like this once in a while.

45
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,200
You sure are all fired up, aren't you, Freeza?

46
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,670
You needn't work yourself up
so much for such an opponent.

47
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,700
I'm just so excited, I can't help it, Papa.

48
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,340
It's nearly enough to make
me hop up and down in here.

49
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,060
Where does Vegeta get his speed from?

50
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,230
It's all I can do just to keep up!

51
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,230
<i>If Freeza has survived, that means</i>
<i>Kakarrot went too easy on him, as I feared.</i>

52
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:55,070
<i>But never mind that,</i>
<i>who is this guy with Freeza,</i>

53
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:58,270
<i>the one with the ki so much larger than his?</i>

54
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,220
Ten<i>-san</i>! Could this <i>ki</i> be...?

55
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,730
King Cold<i>-sama</i>, Freeza<i>-sama,</i>
we are about to land.

56
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,040
They should probably come
down around here somewhere.

57
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,770
You sure about that?

58
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,040
Anyone who doesn't know
him can keep their mouths shut!

59
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,210
At least I've actually fought against this guy.

60
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,720
Hey!

61
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,730
It's Bulma!

62
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,400
Vegeta, Yamucha, yoo-hoo!

63
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,750
Down's-a-daisy!

64
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,750
Yamucha<i>-sama</i>!

65
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,350
What do you guys think you're doing here?

66
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,220
We came to see this Freeza.

67
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,690
After all, when I was on Namek,
I didn't get to see him once!

68
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,030
You came to see him?

69
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,860
Surely you know how dangerous he is!

70
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,730
Sure I know, which is why we came!

71
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:33,240
If Freeza wanted to, he could "BOOM,"
blow up the whole world, right?

72
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,040
It doesn't matter where we are.

73
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,210
So that's why I wanted to have a look at him.

74
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,550
<i>I thought she was just a vulgar</i>
<i>woman, but she's got plenty of guts.</i>

75
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,760
Tenshinhan! Chaozu!

76
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,430
Vegeta! Are you back here on Earth again?

77
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,860
Sounds like you got
something you want to say to me.

78
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,270
You bet I do.

79
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,730
I've got plenty to say to you.

80
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,240
After all, we were killed at your hand.

81
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,250
I can't fathom how Yamucha
can stand to live together with you.

82
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,380
You runt.

83
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,550
What?!

84
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,050
Hey, hold on now!

85
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,180
This isn't the time and place for this.

86
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,760
What's happening is terrible. Is it Freeza?

87
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
Yeah, apparently so.

88
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,760
Hey, you two!

89
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,400
Don't just stand there talking, mask
your battle powers now, you pinheads!

90
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,370
Those guys will have Scouters with them.

91
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,410
That Namekian is doing an excellent job of it.

92
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:45,270
Better than I expected.

93
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,280
Namekian?

94
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,380
Piccolo!

95
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,050
How long has he been there?

96
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,260
Gohan! Everyone's down there!

97
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,030
Piccolo<i>-san</i>'s there too!

98
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,730
Everyone else has been able to sense it.

99
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,230
Hey, everyone!

100
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,500
Yoo-hoo, Kuririn, Gohan<i>-kun</i>!

101
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,270
Gohan!

102
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,750
Is Goku...?

103
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,720
So, he's not back yet, huh?

104
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,420
They're here!

105
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,750
–Oh, hell.
–Oh, hell.

106
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,430
They're landing over there!

107
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,240
It's unmistakable. That's Freeza.

108
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,240
He's survived!

109
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,750
Not only that–

110
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,020
There's definitely someone
else there, besides Freeza.

111
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,690
King Cold<i>-sama</i>, Freeza<i>-sama</i>!

112
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,820
The landing sequence is complete.

113
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,610
Listen up, guys! Do not fly!

114
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,110
Approach on foot, so they
don't pick us up on their Scouters.

115
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,920
Are you going?

116
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,590
Yes!

117
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,130
Just a second...

118
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,600
This Freeza has a <i>ki</i> as
unbelievably huge as that one?

119
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,600
It's not just that. It gets much, much stronger.

120
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,110
And you guys... fought
against someone that strong?

121
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,110
You've gotta be kidding!

122
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,610
Even if we get closer, what can we possibly do?

123
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,620
He's an unbelievably powerful beast!

124
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,920
And there's two of them!

125
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,620
There's nothing we can possibly do!

126
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,790
So what are you going to do?

127
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:32,590
Stay here and rot? Be my guest.

128
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:35,630
Everyone knows there's nothing we can do.

129
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,610
Shall I say it plainly for everyone?

130
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:48,620
This is the end of the Earth.

131
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,640
So this is Earth?

132
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,050
Not a bad planet...

133
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,140
I am the Super Saiyan who has come
here from Earth in order to kill you.

134
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,840
I am Son Goku!

135
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,140
I am the greatest in all the universe!

136
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,280
I am Freeza, emperor of the universe!

137
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,750
And so...

138
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,150
You...

139
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,160
You stinking monkey...

140
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,960
You must die at my hand!!

141
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,470
You...

142
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,950
...must be...

143
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,380
...killed by me!!

144
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,790
You damned fool!!

145
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,800
I can't... believe...

146
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,740
...I was beaten by... that stinking monkey...

147
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,190
King Cold<i>-sama</i>, the planet
Namek has indeed been obliterated.

148
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,790
It appears to have been blown
into a million pieces, destroying it.

149
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,240
Under the circumstances, it appears
that Freeza<i>-sama</i> was lost as well.

150
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:37,170
I can't believe I lost Freeza.

151
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:40,580
Are you saying there is
someone stronger than our clan,

152
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,380
famed as the strongest in the universe?

153
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:57,460
<i>If such is the case, then I, Cold, vow</i>
<i>to squeeze the life right out of them!</i>

154
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,760
What is this?

155
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,050
Send a lifeboat! Bring Freeza back quickly!

156
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,460
<i>Curse you, monkey!</i>

157
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,790
We'll be going to Earth next, Papa.

158
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,200
Earth? Why go to such a place?

159
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,770
So that we can kill the Super Saiyan.

160
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,640
What?!

161
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:55,310
I will take the unbearable
pain of my body's injuries,

162
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,050
as well the pain to my damaged pride,

163
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,220
and return it to him many times over!

164
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,490
The Earthlings don't matter to me,

165
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:11,190
but I'll be sure we snuff out
the life of the Super Saiyan.

166
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:14,130
No matter what steps need to be taken.

167
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,230
The being with the greatest
power in the universe...

168
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,630
...must be from among our clan.

169
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:23,200
Papa, if the two of us fight him
together, we're sure to beat him.

170
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,070
What with my power-up and everything,

171
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,140
I may be able to take care of him by myself.

172
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,650
So, then, there are three hours
before the Super Saiyan returns.

173
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,150
Shall we wait for him, Freeza?

174
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,150
Of course we will, Papa.

175
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,420
However, when he gets here,
I want him to be mortified,

176
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,390
so we'll kill all the Earthlings first.

177
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,730
There's a considerably
large number of people here,

178
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,290
but three hours should be enough time.

179
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,170
Take this, Son Goku!!

180
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,550
I've returned from the depths of
hell itself to have my revenge on you!

181
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,100
Damn.

182
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,130
I've just been brought back to life,
and now I have to die again?

183
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,740
All right!

184
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,110
Everyone spread out and kill off
the Earthlings here, one by one.

185
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:38,450
Go!

186
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,780
Can we help you with something, Earthling?

187
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,250
I have come to kill you.

188
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,420
<i>A mysterious young man suddenly</i>
<i>appears to stand against Freeza's forces.</i>

189
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:29,670
<i>Who can he be? What of Goku?</i>
<i>And what of Earth's fate?</i>

190
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,320
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

191
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,160
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

192
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,530
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

193
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,030
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

194
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:11,540
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

195
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:15,640
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

196
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,150
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

197
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,780
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

198
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,290
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

199
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,390
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

200
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,200
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

201
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,230
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

202
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:44,910
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

203
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:47,070
<i>So sorry.</i>

204
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:52,210
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

205
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,220
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

206
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,700
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

207
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,740
<i>A huge ki appeared all of a sudden,</i>

208
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,310
<i>and wiped out Freeza's men.</i>
<i>What in the world is going on?</i>

209
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,440
<i>Your miscalculation, Freeza,</i>

210
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,750
<i>is that Son Goku-san is not</i>
<i>the one and only Super Saiyan.</i>

211
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,450
<i>There is also another one, right here.</i>

212
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,480
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

213
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,420
<i>"Freeza Halved by a Single Stroke!!</i>
<i>Another Super Saiyan."</i>

214
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,160
<i>It's possible that he's</i>
<i>even stronger than Father.</i>

215
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,930
"Next time"
"Freeza Halved by a Single Stroke!!
Another Super Saiyan"
