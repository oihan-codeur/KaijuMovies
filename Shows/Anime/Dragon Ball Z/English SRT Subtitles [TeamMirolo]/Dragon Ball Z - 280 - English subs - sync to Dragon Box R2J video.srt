00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:24,755
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,215 --> 00:00:30,345
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:36,105
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,775 --> 00:00:41,735
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:48,995
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,035 --> 00:00:54,745
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:57,335
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,255
<i>The sky is clear</i>

9
00:01:00,295 --> 00:01:03,095
<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

10
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:05,675
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,675
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:11,685
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,355
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:14,395 --> 00:01:20,195
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

15
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:23,065
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

16
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,695
<i>My head is clear,</i>

17
00:01:25,735 --> 00:01:28,695
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

18
00:01:28,735 --> 00:01:31,035
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

19
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:34,245
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:37,085
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,875
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

22
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:46,175
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:59,685
<i>At last! The fight between Goku and Majin Boo,</i>
<i>with the entire universe at stake, has begun!</i>

24
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:24,675
Majin Boo, you are one dense guy,

25
00:02:24,715 --> 00:02:27,925
but your power, speed, and
powers of recovery are all incredible!

26
00:02:27,965 --> 00:02:30,595
You're on a whole different
level from all the Boos up to now!

27
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:32,725
You're ridiculously strong!

28
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:41,025
<i>Finally, Goku has become Super Saiyan 3!</i>

29
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:45,735
<i>Will it be Majin Boo that wins?</i>
<i>Or will it be Son Goku?</i>

30
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:53,825
<i>"Vegeta Takes Off His Hat!!</i>
<i>Goku, You Are No. 1."</i>

31
00:03:10,595 --> 00:03:13,635
Damn you, Majin Boo!

32
00:03:32,615 --> 00:03:35,615
Hang in there, blond big brother!

33
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:37,715
Don't be in such a hurry.
The fight is just getting started.

34
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:12,585
Th-This is a fierce fight, huh?
E-Even more than fierce...!

35
00:05:28,725 --> 00:05:31,065
Hang in there, Goku!

36
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:01,555
W-What an awesome fight <i>oni</i>!

37
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,975
If I missed this, I'd regret
it the rest of my life <i>oni</i>!

38
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:14,105
That blond guy looks like that guy who
fell from the Serpentine Road before <i>oni.</i>

39
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:18,445
You're right <i>oni</i>! As I remember,
he was named Son Goku <i>oni</i>!

40
00:06:20,155 --> 00:06:25,745
I hate him! Shatter my cherished
dream of ruling the universe, will you?

41
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,585
Lose! Get yourself beaten!

42
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:33,255
You know, this is surprising.
To think that there is someone

43
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:35,755
who could put on so much
more incredible a fight than I!

44
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,135
Who is the other one <i>oni</i>?

45
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:40,175
I've never seen him <i>oni.</i>

46
00:06:45,135 --> 00:06:51,025
He was, you see, my subordinate, Majin Boo!

47
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:55,605
Ahem... Boo adored me
like I was his older brother,

48
00:06:55,645 --> 00:06:57,655
and anywhere I went, he came with me.

49
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:04,705
I gave him his first lessons for
those techniques he's fighting with now.

50
00:07:04,745 --> 00:07:08,535
However, he's kind of slow on the uptake,
and I couldn't do much with him, really.

51
00:07:10,585 --> 00:07:14,125
Babidi-<i>san</i>, you're some
incredible guy, huh <i>oni</i>?

52
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:16,135
Well... you might say so.

53
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:21,505
And, if you see Boo the
way I do, he's still just a child.

54
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:46,245
Damn! Boo, make a fool of me, will you?
Lose! Lose! Get beaten to a pulp!

55
00:07:46,285 --> 00:07:49,745
Goku, hang in there! Hang in there!

56
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:59,715
The Kaioshin Realm is being destroyed!

57
00:07:59,755 --> 00:08:04,725
Hey, it will still be fine after
just this! Hang in there, Goku!

58
00:08:04,765 --> 00:08:08,805
Get him! Get him some more!
Go! That's it! Give it to him!

59
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,985
There, there, don't worry.

60
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:08,745
Even if we are in the middle of a
dream, I'll be sure to protect you!

61
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:12,705
I am the hero of Earth, Mister Satan!

62
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,965
<i>W-Where are you, Boo?</i>

63
00:09:36,145 --> 00:09:37,645
Hold on...!

64
00:09:42,735 --> 00:09:43,655
Watch out!

65
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:53,245
<i>Where the hell is he going to come out from?</i>

66
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:56,705
<i>Where are you?</i>

67
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,595
So, it was there, huh?

68
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:19,435
<i>Dammit! Not even at Super Saiyan 3</i>
<i>can I keep up with his movements!</i>

69
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:23,855
<i>He's able to read every</i>
<i>movement I'm going to make!</i>

70
00:10:33,705 --> 00:10:37,665
<i>That miserable Majin Boo!</i>
<i>He has terrifying strength...</i>

71
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:55,975
It's all or nothing! This ain't the time to
be thinking about exhausting my power!

72
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:58,725
<i>Ka... me...</i>

73
00:10:58,765 --> 00:11:01,815
<i>ha... me...</i>

74
00:11:01,855 --> 00:11:04,605
<i>Ha</i>!!

75
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,505
<i>Goku!</i>

76
00:11:56,655 --> 00:12:01,705
W-W-W-What's this?! Huh?
Does Majin Boo have that many children?!

77
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:35,695
Kakarrot!

78
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:37,285
Oh, no...

79
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:57,515
Switch out, Kakarrot!

80
00:13:06,645 --> 00:13:09,605
You rest for a little bit!

81
00:13:09,645 --> 00:13:18,075
V-Vegeta... he has... ridiculous
strength... You need to be prepared!

82
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:19,445
I know.

83
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:11,665
Vegeta!

84
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:19,055
<i>Damn! What quick, heavy attacks these are!</i>

85
00:14:19,095 --> 00:14:23,055
<i>Kakarrot was fighting an opponent like this?!</i>

86
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:28,475
How can this be? How can Vegeta
there be absolutely no match for him?

87
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:30,025
This is bad!

88
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:44,325
<i>D-Dammit, he's toying with me!</i>

89
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:48,535
<i>I am the warrior Saiyan</i>
<i>people's prince, Vegeta-sama!</i>

90
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:13,605
Bastard! This is having no effect at all!

91
00:15:13,645 --> 00:15:15,315
Vegeta-<i>san</i>!

92
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:42,845
<i>I-I'm no match for him...</i>
<i>I'm simply no match for him...!</i>

93
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:54,935
<i>I-I'll be killed...!</i>

94
00:16:01,655 --> 00:16:03,445
Kakarrot!

95
00:16:03,485 --> 00:16:07,285
Switch out, Vegeta. Majin Boo is strong.

96
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:11,125
Stronger than anyone
else I've ever fought before!

97
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:16,295
But I ain't lost yet!

98
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:17,965
Kakarrot!

99
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:47,365
<i>Kakarrot, you are one incredible guy...</i>

100
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:50,955
<i>I was absolutely no match against Majin Boo.</i>

101
00:16:50,995 --> 00:16:54,495
<i>You're the only one who can fight with him.</i>

102
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:05,345
<i>Kakarrot... the first time I met you</i>

103
00:17:05,385 --> 00:17:11,265
<i>was when I came to Earth as I was</i>
<i>conquering planets on the frontier.</i>

104
00:17:17,525 --> 00:17:19,525
So, you've shown up?

105
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:26,655
What have you come
all this way for, Kakarrot?

106
00:17:26,695 --> 00:17:29,705
Don't tell me you've come to
say you're going to defeat me,

107
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:32,455
or some other absurd joke, have you?

108
00:18:00,485 --> 00:18:03,365
<i>D-Damned if I'm about to</i>
<i>let something like this happen!</i>

109
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:08,325
<i>I-I am the Saiyan prince! I am ultra-elite!</i>

110
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:14,205
<i>There's no way I can be beaten</i>
<i>by a lower-class warrior like him!</i>

111
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:17,745
<i>I am the greatest in the universe!</i>

112
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:25,795
<i>Ever since then, I lived with the</i>
<i>goal of surpassing you, Kakarrot.</i>

113
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:34,645
<i>It's said that the legendary Super Saiyan</i>
<i>can only appear in one out of a thousand...</i>

114
00:18:34,685 --> 00:18:36,975
<i>Even if the legend were true,</i>

115
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:41,605
<i>the capacity to become a</i>
<i>Super Saiyan lies within me alone!</i>

116
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:45,445
<i>There's no way that</i>
<i>lower-class warrior Kakarrot</i>

117
00:18:45,485 --> 00:18:47,945
<i>could become a legendary Super Saiyan!</i>

118
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:05,425
<i>H-He's clearly surpassed</i>
<i>the Saiyan fighting level.</i>

119
00:19:05,465 --> 00:19:11,715
<i>I-Is the legend really true?</i>
<i>Is he... really a Super Saiyan?!</i>

120
00:19:20,145 --> 00:19:25,605
<i>From my own self-anger, suddenly</i>
<i>I was awakened... to being a Super Saiyan!</i>

121
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:28,025
<i>I was trembling with the joy of it!</i>

122
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,695
<i>Finally, finally, the time</i>
<i>when I had surpassed Kakarrot</i>

123
00:19:30,735 --> 00:19:34,075
<i>and returned as the Saiyan prince had come!</i>

124
00:19:47,425 --> 00:19:52,505
<i>However, in the end,</i>
<i>I was unable to surpass you.</i>

125
00:19:55,215 --> 00:20:01,395
<i>At first, I thought it was because</i>
<i>you had something to protect–</i>

126
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,565
<i>that having a strong mind</i>
<i>towards defending something</i>

127
00:20:03,605 --> 00:20:07,565
<i>gave rise to some mysterious power...</i>

128
00:20:10,025 --> 00:20:15,995
<i>That certainly may be true, but if that were it,</i>
<i>then it would have been the same for me, now.</i>

129
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:19,535
<i>It was to have my own way,</i>

130
00:20:19,575 --> 00:20:22,375
<i>it was for my own enjoyment,</i>
<i>it was to kill my enemies,</i>

131
00:20:22,415 --> 00:20:24,875
<i>and it was for my own</i>
<i>pride that I had fought...</i>

132
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:33,555
<i>But, Kakarrot, you were different.</i>
<i>You don't fight in order to win,</i>

133
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:36,055
<i>you fight in order to be certain you do not lose,</i>

134
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:39,555
<i>and in order to keep reaching your limits.</i>

135
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:43,435
<i>That's why you don't worry</i>
<i>about taking your opponent's life.</i>

136
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:50,445
<i>In the end, you never did kill me.</i>

137
00:20:50,485 --> 00:20:56,735
<i>It's as if you knew that I would now</i>
<i>come to have the slightest bit of a heart.</i>

138
00:20:57,575 --> 00:21:03,375
<i>It's so maddening! That there should</i>
<i>be a Saiyan who loves to fight, yet is kind!</i>

139
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:08,585
<i>Hang in there, Kakarrot!</i>
<i>You are Number One!</i>

140
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:33,025
Please, anything but that!!

141
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:04,395
A-Awesome <i>oni</i>!

142
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:18,445
<i>Even the highly proud Vegeta</i>
<i>has at last taken off his hat!</i>

143
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:22,285
<i>The battle between Son Goku</i>
<i>and Majin Boo continues.</i>

144
00:22:22,325 --> 00:22:26,575
<i>Goku, hang in there!</i>
<i>Protect the universe's tomorrows!</i>

145
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:36,755
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

146
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:43,345
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

147
00:22:47,555 --> 00:22:53,905
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

148
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:59,985
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

149
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:06,995
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
