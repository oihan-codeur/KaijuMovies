16
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,160

Huh? When did I happen
to get down from that cliff?

24
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,560
Last night, I was looking
at the moon, and then...

25
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,270
And then, I don't remember anything.

26
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,040
Oh, well.

27
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,070
I need to wash my face.

28
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,980
Something sure is weird!

29
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,890
Huh? Wha–? Huh? It's gone! My tail!

30
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,990
I wonder if it got
pulled off while I was asleep.

31
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,730
Huh?

32
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,900
My clothes have changed!

33
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,000
Huh? That's strange.

34
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,730
Don't come over here! Huh? A sword?

35
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,760
Stay back!

36
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,070
Don't! I don't want to do this, you know!

37
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,080
Why are they just after me?!

38
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,480
I don't taste very good!

39
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,350
Help!

40
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, I'm so hungry!
Ain't there anything to eat?

41
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,740
That's a picture of a <i>vimana,</i>
from the Nemurian civilization!

42
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,140
It's just like the one
that tried to catch me.

43
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:14,580
A 3-S Series prototype.
This is an incredibly old capsule robot.

44
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,320
Who's there?
I was sleeping so pleasantly.

45
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,890
I-It spoke!

46
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,390
Who is it that's there?

47
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,890
M-My name... is Son Gohan!

48
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:40,870
Don't talk so loudly. Sand will fall
down here at even the slightest vibration.

49
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,900
I'm Son Gohan.

50
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,900
Son Gohan...

51
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,670
Mister, what are you doing here?

52
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,980
That's no business of yours.
Turn off my switch and leave here at once.

53
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,080
Leave here?

54
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,090
There is an exit behind me.

55
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,890
All right!

56
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,260
I'm saved!

57
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,300
Wait! Turn off my switch before you go.

58
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,810
Sorry about that.

59
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,970
Thanks, Mister.

60
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,870
Mister!

61
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,330
It's no good going that way!

62
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,770
Y-You fool! Don't talk so loudly!

63
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,640
I can't get down from there.

64
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,070
Is that any of my concern?

65
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,240
But...

66
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:59,310
I told you not to turn on my switch,
didn't I? I wish to remain asleep.

67
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,910
But still...

68
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,420
Hurry up and go.

69
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,320
I can't get down from there! I'll die!

70
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,190
Don't cry!

71
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,090
Don't cry. That exit is the only one.

72
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,930
If you want to survive,
jump down from there.

73
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,330
You don't mean it!

74
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,470
Why are you acting like such a baby?

75
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:25,840
If you stay here,
you'll just be buried in sand.

76
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,370
Hurry up and go.

77
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,880
Are you gone?

78
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,980
Ah, Son Gohan! My switch!
Turn off my switch before you go!

79
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:45,320
He left without turning off my switch.
I'm just wasting my energy like this.

80
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,060
Mister?

81
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,060
Y-You're still there?

82
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,900
Mister, your visual sensors are damaged, huh?

83
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,030
I'll fix them for you.

84
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,070
S-Stop it!

85
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:05,740
Stop! Mind your own business! I don't
need visual sensors any more! S-Stop!

86
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,680
Can you see now?

87
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,650
There's no point in you doing this.
Hmm, you're still a child, aren't you?

88
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,660
I'm surprised that someone like you
would be in a dangerous place like this.

89
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,140
Right, see? There's no way I could
jump down from that place, you see?

90
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,670
Unless you want to die here,
you should be able to.

91
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,910
But Mister, if you'd
just cooperate with me!

92
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,770
Do not turn to me!

93
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,090
And don't turn on my
switch again. You got that?

94
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:55,360
Now, turn off my switch, and then
get out of here. I wish to sleep quietly.

95
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,800
Hurry now, turn off my switch.

96
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,430
Mother...

97
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,920
Is it okay if I eat all of this?

98
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,660
I can still eat more and more!

99
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,870
Mister!

100
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,870
Wake up!

101
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:51,240
Again? I told you not to wake me.

102
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,010
T-There's a scorpion!

103
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,950
There's bound to be one
or two scorpions around.

104
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,490
I'm scared.

105
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,420
Turn off my switch. Don't make
me say the same thing over and over.

106
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,730
–But...
–Hurry up.

107
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,400
Oh, I am so hungry!

108
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,410
I wonder if I can eat these clouds.

109
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,040
It's me. I'm hungry.

110
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:30,280
Cut it out already. Don't turn on
my switch over such trivial things!

111
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,880
But...

112
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,660
There's no reason for there
to be anything to eat here, is there?

113
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,630
Scorpions and snakes are about
all the things you <i>can</i> eat around here.

114
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,170
Don't cry!

115
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,600
I'm hungry!

116
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,280
Don't use such a loud voice!
You'll be buried too.

117
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,450
A-All right, but just this once.

118
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,250
Let's see. At this time
of year, inside this cave...

119
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,890
Go search all the deeper corners.

120
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,020
Right.

121
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,600
Ah, I've eaten! I've eaten!

122
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,440
I found some, I found some!

123
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,440
All of this.

124
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,280
Then you don't need me
anymore, right? Turn off my switch.

125
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,280
But I can't eat these raw.

126
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,450
You won't be able to
survive in these plains like that.

127
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,220
Mister, you have a cooking system, huh?

128
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,290
I read so in a robot picture book.

129
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:50,200
You're a 3-S type all-purpose
capsule robot C-6, right Mister?

130
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,230
It says in my picture book
that you're quite a superior robot.

131
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,170
W-Well, I guess so.
Shall I fry those up for you?

132
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,470
Open up my head.

133
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,480
Right.

134
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,880
Set it down inside.

135
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,880
Right.

136
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,850
–Close it.
–Right.

137
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,850
What kind of flavor do you want?
Chinese-style? Western-style?

138
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,860
My mother's style!

139
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,490
How should I know what that is?

140
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,830
It's done.

141
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,470
Yow-ow-ow...

142
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,030
Mister, it's too hot.

143
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,300
Am I to blame for that as well?

144
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,110
I humbly accept this food.

145
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,010
–How is it that you're in this sort of place?
–This is yucky.

146
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,220
I'm lost. I want to go
back to my mother's place,

147
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,680
but I don't know what I should do.

148
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,990
That is rough, huh?

149
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:54,060
It's not possible for a little
kid like you to cross the desert.

150
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:01,700
Having said that, it will be even
harder for you to live in this desert.

151
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,170
Mister, what is it that brought you here?

152
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,440
An accident.

153
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,170
An accident?

154
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,780
It was an investigation
into excavating these ruins.

155
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,680
No sooner had I found this
place than, hmm, I ended up like this.

156
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,250
The ground around here is not very firm,
so earthquakes are constantly occurring.

157
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,450
I've been here in the sand ever since.

158
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,690
This Nemurian temple was
a great discovery, wasn't it?

159
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,230
How do you know about that?

160
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:33,600
It said so in a picture book.
Anyhow, there might be someone else

161
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,870
who comes searching the
area that helps us out, huh?

162
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,470
It's been eighty years now
since I've been buried in the sand.

163
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,440
Hey, what are you doing?!

164
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,280
I'm going... to get you... out of here, Mister!

165
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,750
Stop that! I want to stay with this city!

166
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,090
Mind your own business!
Leave me alone like this!

167
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,460
You can leave here together with me!

168
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,390
Don't worry about me.

169
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,900
I can store up energy and
leap out of here all at once. Stop!

170
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm losing my balance!

171
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,540
Watch out!

172
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,980
Get out of here, quickly!
The cave is collapsing!

173
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,250
–But...
–Hurry and get to the exit!

174
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,850
You don't want to die, do you?

175
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,290
You come with me too, Mister!

176
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:35,090
That's all right. I will turn out okay.
I'm a superior 3-S type, after all.

177
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,590
Hurry and get going!

178
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,470
There, it's settled down.
Go now, while you can!

179
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,300
Don't cause me any more trouble!

180
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,310
Right...

181
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:50,510
Now, summon up your courage
and jump with all your might.

182
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,880
What's the matter? Son Gohan!

183
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:59,390
Jump! Jump, I say!

184
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,150
All right!

185
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,460
I have to turn off your switch!

186
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,940
You fool! Don't come back!

187
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,080
Mister!

188
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,250
Son Gohan...

189
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,480
It appears you're okay, right?

190
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,120
The exit has been blocked.

191
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,320
Son Gohan... listen to me...

192
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,660
Open up my head and connect
the blue wire to the red wire.

193
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,470
–Do it quickly.
–Right.

194
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,440
If you don't hurry, the
ceiling is going to come down!

195
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,440
Dammit, my energy is
beginning to leak out...

196
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,110
I've connected them!

197
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,630
Damn it all!

198
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,110
Mister!

199
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,290
Power at full! Now, Son Gohan!

200
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,420
Mister!

201
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,690
Take care of yourself.

202
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:18,490
Mister!

203
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,400
Mister!

204
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,190
Mister...

205
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,120
This is all my fault!

206
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,290
Son... Gohan...

207
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,960
Thank goodness! You're still alive!

208
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,910
More or less. But it appears
that my energy is all used up.

209
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,410
Never mind about that, hurry up and go on.

210
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,010
Mister!

211
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,020
Don't cry, even when you're all alone.

212
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,220
You can't rely on anyone else
around here if you're going to survive.

213
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,560
No!

214
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:36,540
Hush, would you? I can't
take any more. Be... quiet...

215
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,940
Mister?

216
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,420
Mister!

217
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:56,390
Wake up! Mister! Mister, wake up!

218
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,390
Mister!

219
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:22,450
<i>Goku and Gohan– what sort</i>
<i>of adventures await them next?</i>

220
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,320
<i>The Saiyans are closing in</i>

221
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,310
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>

<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

230
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,350
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

233
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:44,960
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

234
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,130
<i>So sorry.</i>

235
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,240

<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

238
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,090
<i>You sure are getting strong,</i>
<i>Gohan. Still, you have a ways to go.</i>

239
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:21,730
<i>Father, where are your friends,</i>
<i>Yamucha-san and Tenshinhan-san?</i>

240
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,240

241
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,210

"Next time"
