00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:24,600
<i>The craziness surges toward us,</i>

2
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:30,180
<i>This is no time for tears.</i>

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,940
<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:41,570
<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,830
<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,590
<i>Will someday make you an incredible guy.</i>

7
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,170
<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

8
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,090
<i>The sky is clear</i>

<i>IPPAI OPPAI</i>

00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,470
<i>I am feeling fine.</i>

11
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,470
<i>The trouble is here, so enjoy,</i>

12
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,480
<i>You naughty little boy,</i>

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,150
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

<i>NO... TEN P-KAN</i>

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,490
<i>My head is clear,</i>

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,490
<i>RA-MEN ROPPAI</i>

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,870
<i>Mother doesn't care.</i>

00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,080
<i>It's the century's end, so twist and twirl,</i>

20
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,920
<i>You mischievous little girl,</i>

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,710
<i>We Gotta Power!</i>

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,010
<i>Dragon Ball Z!</i>

23
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,730
<i>One month remains until</i>
<i>Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo, Mister Satan,</i>

24
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,150
<i>Videl, and even Goku, in the Next World,</i>

25
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,650
<i>will be competing in the Tenkaichi Tournament.</i>

26
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,360
Say, is it okay if I become like you, Big Brother?

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,570
That Super Saiyan thing?

28
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:17,460
<i>Goten's talents were astonishing.</i>
<i>Even Gohan was unable to contain him.</i>

29
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,510
Big Brother, if you're thinking of flying,

30
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,220
then you have to teach me
how to do it too, or it isn't fair!

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,940
You got it, you got it! Don't get so upset, Goten!

32
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,810
I'll teach you how to fly!

33
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,230
Wow! All right!

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,900
<i>And then Videl dropped by uninvited...</i>

35
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,820
You promised me you
would teach me how to fly, right?

36
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,580
U-Uh, of course I'll teach you.

37
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,870
<i>Gohan's special training in Bukujutsu has begun.</i>

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,880
<i>"Ah, You're Flying!!</i>
<i>Videl's Introduction to Bukujutsu."</i>

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,270
Okay, I'm going to teach you two Bukujutsu,

40
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,560
which is to say, how to fly through the air.

41
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:25,730
This only requires you to control
your <i>ki</i>, so it is not all that difficult.

42
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,490
Now, if you're thinking of flying at faster speeds,

43
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,580
then yes, it does become
comparably more challenging.

44
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,170
<i>Ki</i> control? Say, what's this <i>ki</i>?

45
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,590
What's <i>ki</i>...?

46
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,170
I get it, you guys must call it
something different where you're from.

47
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:51,390
See, there's this hidden energy or power or
whatever you want to call it inside your body.

48
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:55,470
Huh? What do you mean, hidden power?

49
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:02,190
What should I do here?
How should I explain this...?

50
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,030
He means this.

51
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,290
Right, right, right, that kind of power.

52
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,750
I see...

53
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,500
What do you guys call this kind of power?

54
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,180
"A trick," I suppose.

55
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,560
Trick? This is something
completely different from a trick.

56
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,560
There's nothing even to set up.

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,150
Well, to be frank with you, I don't
know anything about this magic-like power!

58
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,730
You don't know about <i>ki</i>?
That's going to be problematic...

59
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,070
Listen, are you saying that if
you don't have <i>ki</i>, you can't fly?

60
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,990
It's okay, it's okay, everyone has <i>ki.</i>

61
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,160
Controlling it is difficult, though...

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,750
Honest?

63
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,170
Honest!

64
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,920
Goten, could you wait a little bit on Bukujutsu?

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,760
First, I have to teach
Videl-<i>san</i> how to control her <i>ki.</i>

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,170
We'll do it after that.

67
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,180
Are you sure you're not asking too much?

68
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,180
She doesn't even know what "<i>ki</i>" means.

69
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,310
I-I'll learn!

70
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,730
It's okay, just go off and play somewhere.

71
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:22,140
Okay! I'll go play!

72
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,730
Hurry up and teach me how to fly, okay?

73
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,400
Yeah!

74
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,660
Ready? Be still, and relax...

75
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Slowly, draw out the power within you.

76
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,480
You see?

77
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,080
Okay, you try it.

78
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,170
Let's see...

79
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:36,760
Be still, and relax...

80
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,170
No, no, don't force it. Unless you're
relaxed, you can't draw out your <i>ki.</i>

81
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,090
You have to concentrate.

82
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,600
–I humbly accept this meal.
–I humbly accept this meal!

83
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,560
Thank you for letting me have lunch.

84
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,900
Got no choice. I can't very well let
you go without eatin' all by yourself.

85
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,370
This is delicious.

86
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,160
Much more delicious than
what our own cook makes.

87
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,750
Cook? What, do you work as a chef or somethin'?

88
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,500
No, I mean the cook that
we employ at our house.

89
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,920
You hire a cook?! You're not,
by any chance, rich, are you?!

90
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,090
How many rooms do you
have in your house?! 10?! 20?!

91
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,970
How many are there, I wonder...

92
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,140
Around 50, maybe?

93
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,110
50?! You're stinkin' rich, aren't you?!

94
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,160
This really is delicious.

95
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,870
When are you two gettin' married?!

96
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,750
Big Brother, are you and
Videl-<i>san</i> getting married?

97
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:34,380
N-No! No! No! No! No, I tell you!

98
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,790
Yes, yes! That's the way!

99
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,360
You did it! That's your <i>ki</i>!
You practice the martial arts,

100
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,940
so sure enough, you got the
hang of it quickly, Videl-<i>san</i>!

101
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,910
Well, can I fly now?

102
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,500
That won't be possible yet.

103
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,250
You've got to be able to
control your <i>ki</i> freely, first.

104
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,160
Same old-fashioned training as ever, huh?

105
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,580
Oh, Kaio of the South,
is that you? It's been a while.

106
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:36,420
Ah, that's Son Goku, who participated in the
Anoyoichi Tournament several years ago, isn't it?

107
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:39,170
He might have gotten to the
final round on a fluke back then,

108
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:43,170
but it appears he still hasn't received any
special training from Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i>, huh?

109
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,680
Grand Kaio-<i>sama</i> is a busy man.
But, it will happen soon enough.

110
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,770
How heavy a load is there in
those weights he's wearing?

111
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,480
Oh, not all that much. Each one is two tons.

112
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,480
T-Two tons?

113
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,150
Apparently, that surprises you.

114
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,740
Don't be ridiculous! I'm not surprised!

115
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,580
This is Papoi, who has arrived
from my own southern area.

116
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,910
He is the Southern Galaxy's greatest
hero from the last thousand years.

117
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,960
He's incredibly strong.

118
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,290
If he had entered that
last Anoyoichi Tournament,

119
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,170
we would have been far and away the winner.

120
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,170
Compared to him, Son Goku is no big deal.

121
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:28,390
Oh? What do you think about
this–there's a martial arts tournament

122
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:32,100
being held on a planet called Earth coming up,
and he is going to be entering it specially.

123
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,220
How about you enter Papoi-<i>kun</i>, too?

124
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,440
Very well...

125
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,740
Papoi will win for sure, no doubt about it!

126
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Hey, Goku! Do you want to try
some weights that are a little heavier?

127
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,250
Yeah, fine with me, but how
heavy are you going to make them?

128
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,580
Well, let's see, how about
you try going to ten tons?

129
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,920
T-Ten tons, you say?!
You're kidding, right?

130
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,970
Ten tons? Ain't that asking
a bit much, even from me?

131
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,550
I won't be able to move!

132
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,180
Yeah, right, yeah, right!

133
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,140
That would be impossible,
no matter how strong you are!

134
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:21,390
You still enjoy telling those same lame
jokes that you always have, Kaio of the North.

135
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,820
Goku, you're free to turn Super Saiyan.

136
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,860
Ah, in that case, it's perfectly fine.

137
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:37,830
Hey, Kaio of the South, go ahead
and change those weights to ten tons.

138
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,580
T-Ten tons! That will make
for a total weight of 40 tons!

139
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,250
I'll do it for real! You ready?

140
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,540
Yeah!

141
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,260
I'm really, really going to do it!

142
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,850
Just do it, will you?

143
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,350
It's not my fault if you break something!

144
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,120
Tha-at's done it!

145
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,470
The martial arts tournament
is 28 days away by Earth time.

146
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,800
Papoi-<i>kun</i>, you should be
excited about entering, too.

147
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,480
P-Papoi, now that I think about it,
that tournament sounds like a drag, huh?

148
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,230
Well, let's think long and hard about it.

149
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,110
It might be better if you didn't enter, huh?

150
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,110
Not some lousy tournament like that...

151
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,330
Now then, as to how you fly, you
have to be able to control your <i>ki</i> well...

152
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,040
like I showed you earlier... and then float...

153
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,880
You don't hop around;

154
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,220
you have to draw out the
power from your whole body...

155
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,310
...and concentrate your <i>ki...</i>

156
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,670
That's good, that's good!

157
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:53,170
I'm floating, I'm floating!

158
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,640
Way to go, Goten!

159
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,270
Goten, don't overdo it!

160
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:09,060
I'm okay, Big Brother!

161
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,820
Goten! Goten!

162
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,240
Goten, this is why I told you not to overdo it.

163
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,830
But it's all right. Soon,
you'll be able to fly freely.

164
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:23,620
Mm-hmm. By the way,

165
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,830
when are we going to do your
special training, Big Brother?

166
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,250
Shh, not until after Videl-<i>san</i> goes home.

167
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,250
Once she leaves, we'll do
it as much as we want to.

168
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,250
Uh-huh!

169
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,270
Gohan-<i>kun</i>! What about me?!

170
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,730
Right, right, right, right!

171
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,730
You know, it's getting pretty late.

172
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:53,230
Won't your father be worried about you?

173
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,480
That's all right. Flying is more important.

174
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,830
Well, let's continue. Let's see...
draw out more of your body's power...

175
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,000
...and, uh, focus your <i>ki</i> together...

176
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,480
That's the way, that's the way!

177
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,240
You did it! You're floating!
You're floating slightly!

178
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,790
Shh! Be quiet! I can't concentrate!

179
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,350
That was incredible, wasn't it?

180
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,260
It's amazing that you've gotten so
you're able to float in just one day!

181
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,850
You don't say...

182
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,480
I've done it, Big Brother! See?!

183
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:18,820
G-Goten was already able to control
his <i>ki</i> capably when we started.

184
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,240
Videl-<i>san</i>, once you get as good as
he is, it will be no problem for you.

185
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,660
If you just practice from now on
by yourself, you'll get so you can fly.

186
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,250
I'm coming back tomorrow.

187
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:38,250
W-Why? You've practically got it down,
don't you? Practicing by yourself will be plenty.

188
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,840
I want to know more about <i>ki.</i>

189
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,680
Or is my being here getting in your way?

190
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,090
N-No, it's not like that...

191
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,180
Well then, until tomorrow.

192
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,610
Bye-bye.

193
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,610
Good-bye.

194
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,820
C-Come to think of it...

195
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,820
What?

196
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:04,900
Videl-<i>san</i>, about your hair...

197
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,700
I think it would be better if it was shorter.

198
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:20,260
Gohan-<i>kun</i>... short hair is more to your taste?

199
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,300
N-No, it's not a matter of taste!
When you're in a match,

200
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,680
I just think that having it
shorter would be more convenient.

201
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,100
You see, when it's long, it can get in your eyes,

202
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,060
or it could be pulled by your opponent...

203
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,020
You just be quiet and leave me alone!
That's up to me to decide, isn't it?!

204
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,830
Why did Sissy get all upset?

205
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,790
I-I don't know...

206
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,960
But you know something...?

207
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,420
We can't train!

208
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,820
Don't overexert yourself, Trunks.
You should leave the room.

209
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,820
This 150x gravity is far too much for you.

210
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,830
Last night, I got a phone call from Goten-<i>kun.</i>

211
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,540
Goten-<i>kun</i> said he was going to
enter the Tenkaichi Tournament.

212
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,670
So I'm thinking of entering, too.

213
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,250
Hmph, this is going to be pretty festive, huh?

214
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:46,670
It's too hard like this, all right.
I think I'll turn Super Saiyan!

215
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,600
<i>What the...?</i>

216
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,560
Lucky! Lucky!

217
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:02,650
S-Since when has he been able to...?

218
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,150
Y-You've got to be kidding me.

219
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,450
He turned into a Super Saiyan,
the warrior of legend, that easily...?

220
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,750
Trunks...

221
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,040
Yes?

222
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,750
Can Son Gohan's brother
turn, too? Into a Super Saiyan?

223
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,590
Yes.

224
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,460
It's as if there's a Super
Saiyan bargain sale going on...

225
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,760
Come at me!

226
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,810
That would be too much
for me, no matter what I did.

227
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,770
Dad, you're too strong.

228
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,770
Come at me, right now! How about this–

229
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,770
if you can land just one blow to my face,

230
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,190
I'll take you to the amusement park.

231
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:47,190
Really?! You will, Dad?! All right...!

232
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,570
Come at me as hard as you can. Got that?

233
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,990
Here I come!

234
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,590
That was mean, hitting back like that!

235
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,010
Don't act so spoiled!

236
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,760
I never said I wouldn't hit back.

237
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,590
That's terrible...!

238
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,720
D-Don't cry! I'll take you to the amusement park.

239
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,770
Never mind that, tell me, between you and
Son Gohan's brother, which of you is stronger?

240
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:23,560
I'm just a little bit stronger.

241
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,190
Goten-<i>kun</i> is a year younger than
me and all, and he can't fly yet.

242
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,570
<i>Just a little bit, huh?</i>

243
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,490
<i>What the hell is going</i>
<i>on here, for crying out loud?</i>

244
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,740
Let's get some training in
fast, before we're interrupted!

245
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,990
Uh-huh!

246
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,590
Y-Yikes!

247
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:03,940
Big Brother, who is that?

248
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,270
Well, shall we continue from
where we left off yesterday?

249
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,690
V-Videl-<i>san...</i>

250
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,400
I just don't understand girls.

251
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,660
<i>Goten and Trunks, who had been hiding</i>
<i>their talents, were having a good time.</i>

252
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,910
<i>What remains a mystery is what</i>
<i>is going on inside Videl's heart,</i>

253
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,830
<i>now that she has drastically cut her hair.</i>

254
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,460
<i>Gohan has absolutely no idea.</i>

255
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,890
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

256
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,430
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

257
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:56,030
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

258
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:02,120
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

259
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,130
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

260
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,510
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

261
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:18,390
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

262
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:27,440
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

263
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,980
<i>Even now?</i>

264
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:36,610
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

265
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:42,030
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

266
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:48,500
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

267
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:58,550
<i>Look! I can see the rainbow in your eyes.</i>
<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

268
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,530
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

269
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:18,490
<i>Yoo-hoo! Long time no see!</i>
<i>It's been seven years.</i>

270
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,870
<i>You've all changed quite a bit.</i>
<i>How have you been?</i>

271
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,370
<i>Goku-sa! Welcome back!</i>
<i>We've been waitin' for you!</i>

272
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,710
<i>Look, Goten, it's your father.</i>

273
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,620
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

274
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,090
<i>"Welcome Back, Goku!</i>
<i>The Entire Z Team Assembles!!"</i>

275
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,460
<i>We're all about to enter the</i>
<i>Tenkaichi Tournament together!</i>

276
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,630
"Next time"
"Welcome Back, Goku!
The Entire Z Team Assembles!!"
