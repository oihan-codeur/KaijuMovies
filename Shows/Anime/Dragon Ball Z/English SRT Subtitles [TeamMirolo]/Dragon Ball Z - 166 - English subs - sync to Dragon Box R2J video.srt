00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,070
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,250
<i>In the face of Cell's</i>
<i>bottomless power, even Trunks,</i>

17
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,800
<i>who had gone beyond Super Saiyan,</i>

18
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,350
<i>The fate of the Earth was as</i>
<i>a candle in the wind. However...</i>

19
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,190
I have one final question.

20
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,270
How is it you were able to power
up that much in such a short time?

21
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,280
If you had more time, is it possible
you could become even stronger?

22
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,780
How should I know?
I couldn't tell unless I tried it.

23
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,120
So then, it's not impossible, huh?

24
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,040
Very well. Then, in order
to alleviate my boredom,

25
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,370
I will hold a martial arts tournament.

26
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:38,790
<i>What was this? He is going to</i>
<i>hold a Tenkaichi Tournament?</i>

27
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,300
<i>With extraordinary confidence in himself,</i>

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,760
<i>Cell has suddenly changed the situation around.</i>

29
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:57,850
<i>"A Final Battle Closes In on Goku!!</i>
<i>The Mystery of the New Tenkaichi Tournament."</i>

30
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,710
My biggest aim, of course,

31
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:20,540
is to see the faces of humans, struck with terror!

32
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,210
Yes, yes! That's the sort of face.

33
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,720
Dammit!!

34
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,150
T-Thank goodness! Somehow, he's still unharmed!

35
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:25,150
B-But what happened? Where did Cell go?

36
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:27,280
Hey! Wait for me!

37
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,530
Dad...

38
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,200
What happened to Cell?

39
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,300
I can't beat him... I couldn't beat him.

40
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,880
W-What the hell happened here?

41
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,310
I'm sorry. I was not able to do anything.

42
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,320
Hmph. Of course not.

43
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,110
There's no way the likes of you

44
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,780
could have beaten Cell in his perfect form, right?

45
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,320
T-That's just not so!

46
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,160
After all, Trunks has so much more power than y–

47
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,990
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

48
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,900
Ah, there, there! There, there, there, there!

49
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,810
Hey there, you guys!

50
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,240
Don't just stand there, hurry
and go help him! Trunks is–

51
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,030
Trunks is going to die, you know!

52
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:59,330
Don't worry! He got through it without being killed.

53
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:02,330
–Really?!
–How's that?

54
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,170
M-Miserable Cell! What kind of guy are you?

55
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,710
At the time, Trunks' power was
indisputably higher than Cell's!

56
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,340
How in the hell did he
overcome that difference?

57
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,930
It looks as though I, too, will have to go in
there next–into the Room of Spirit and Time!

58
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,150
M-Martial arts tournament?!

59
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,360
T-That's what he said?

60
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,900
<i>Damn him!</i>

61
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,360
<i>He's using us to amuse himself!</i>

62
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,700
But who's going to participate?

63
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,740
He's an opponent even you
guys couldn't do anything against!

64
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,760
I...! I...

65
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,560
Once Goku-<i>san</i> comes out,

66
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,980
I plan on going back into the
Room of Spirit and Time and train again.

67
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,570
Neither you or Kakarrot will be necessary!

68
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:18,200
Once I use that room for
one more day, it will be settled.

69
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,700
Me too...

70
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,290
I will join the tournament too!

71
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,290
N-No. 16...!

72
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,920
P-Please, take me to the Capsule Corporation.

73
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,090
To the place where mom is, you say?

74
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,760
T-That's right.

75
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,930
There, I will have her repair
me so that I can fight again.

76
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:46,940
You'll see, I'm sure to be of some use.

77
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,770
Don't be ridiculous!

78
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,730
You're one of Doctor Gero's
Artificial Humans, aren't you?!

79
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,750
Wai–!

80
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,300
Sure thing.

81
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,010
I'll take you there, and ask her for you.

82
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,720
Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

83
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,680
You don't have to worry, Trunks.

84
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,560
I don't think this guy is bad.

85
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,730
But...!

86
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,230
Those other two,
that were swallowed up by Cell,

87
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,730
weren't all that bad, either.

88
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,400
They are indeed different
from the Artificial Humans

89
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,660
that were in your future,
by their very dimension.

90
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,700
And besides, right now, we need
all the strong allies we can get, right?

91
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,950
Here goes...

92
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,540
I owe you one.

93
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,260
<i>Hmph. Hurry and come on out of there, Kakarrot!</i>

94
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,670
<i>No matter what you've done, it's useless.</i>

95
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,930
<i>If I can just go into that room one more time,</i>

96
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,140
<i>we'll get by without having Cell lord it over us.</i>

97
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,740
I'm not about to lose...

98
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,290
I'm sorry, Father.

99
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,330
I fell asleep before I knew it.

100
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,130
You've sure worked hard, Gohan.

101
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,630
That's enough for today, now rest.

102
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,760
But then, what will you do, Father?

103
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,230
I'm going to go try to train a little longer.

104
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,940
T-Then I will do so too! Please, take me with you!

105
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:24,240
All right, I'll finish for the day, too.

106
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,240
Father...

107
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,780
But then, Gohan...

108
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,160
Tomorrow we're going to
have even harsher training!

109
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:37,670
We have to get you to aim even higher
than Super Saiyan as soon as we can!

110
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,670
R-Right!

111
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,380
So, should we get something to eat?

112
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,790
Yes!

113
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,150
Here, thanks for waiting.

114
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,190
Drink your fill, okay?

115
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,820
Oh, my! Vegeta-<i>chan</i>, it's been so long!

116
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:16,160
You're as handsome as ever!

117
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,710
My, this gentleman over
here is handsome as well!

118
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,300
Are you a friend of Vegeta-<i>chan</i>?

119
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,710
B-By all means, I'm pleased to meet you.

120
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,720
Pardon us. Is Bulma-<i>san</i> here?

121
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,140
Oh, what's that now?

122
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,770
–Um, I said Bulma-<i>san...</i>
–Yo, Kuririn!

123
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,650
If you're looking for Bulma, she just contacted us.

124
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,150
She said she was on her way here now.

125
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,070
Then she's not yet back from
the Heavenly Realm? I see...

126
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,780
Hey!!

127
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,750
Muten Roshi-<i>sama</i>!

128
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:07,340
We got a message that everyone would
be returning to the Capsule Corporation.

129
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,510
Staying at the Kame House,

130
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,180
there's no way of knowing
what the situation is, and all.

131
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,180
Where's Gohan-<i>chan</i>?!

132
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,350
He's, you see, still at the Heavenly Realm.

133
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,720
Still, huh?

134
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:26,270
Let's see... that's funny... then this here is...

135
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,200
So that's it.

136
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,370
A Tenkaichi Tournament, huh?

137
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,210
Yes. That's what Cell said.

138
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,380
It will be held ten days from now.

139
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,710
He said he would let us know
the location and everything later.

140
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,630
I wonder, will the matches will
be held like in the tournament?

141
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:53,930
No. I'm not entirely sure
about it all, but apparently,

142
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,640
the format will be one fighter
challenging Cell at a time.

143
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,100
Miserable Cell!

144
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,310
Is that what he told you? I get it, then.

145
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,150
It must just be his arrogance,

146
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,730
now that he's obtained
the ultimate in strength.

147
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,110
Still, by choosing the Tenkaichi Tournament,

148
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,110
he's being rather sharp, isn't he?

149
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,320
I can't wait to show what I've got!

150
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,320
It has you fired up, huh Yamucha-<i>sama</i>?

151
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,120
Yeah!

152
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,950
You can say so, but you were
beaten in every single one, huh?

153
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:28,130
Turtle Hermit-<i>san</i>, what is this
Tenkaichi-whatever Tournament, anyhow?

154
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,840
Oh, yes indeed!

155
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,760
Well, allow me, as one who has
won the Tenkaichi Tournament,

156
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,300
to explain it to you.

157
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:40,140
Huh? Muten Roshi-<i>sama,</i>
you've won it before too?

158
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,180
He's talking about a long
time ago. A really long time ago.

159
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,100
Long ago, there was a contest

160
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,940
held among all the masters of the martial arts,

161
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,320
to determine who among them
had risen to the highest peak,

162
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,320
and was the <i>Tenkaichi,</i>

163
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,980
the best martial artist under heaven.

164
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,620
The first time Goku and the
others participated was during,

165
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,330
as I recall, the 21st Tenkaichi Tournament, right?

166
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,790
It was Goku's first appearance,

167
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,330
and yet he managed to reach the final round!

168
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,210
However, his opponent was too much for him.

169
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:14,300
He was unfortunately beaten by
another master, named Jackie Chun.

170
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,130
And then, five years later,

171
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,140
the 22nd Tenkaichi Tournament was held.

172
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,470
It was at this time, you see,

173
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:25,310
that Tenshinhan and Chaozu
first appeared before my eyes.

174
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,060
And so, as Goku and
Tenshinhan competed for victory,

175
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,360
and by a narrow margin, Goku lost!

176
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:38,740
What a lower-level fight!

177
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,990
That's why everyone here
could compete in this tournament,

178
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,370
given your level of ability.

179
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:51,340
Now, the 23rd Tenkaichi Tournament,
which was held three years afterward–

180
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,050
that was one awesome
and tumultuous tournament!

181
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,930
After all, Goku got married,

182
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:03,350
Piccolo, using the name Ma Junior, entered,

183
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,350
and Kami-<i>sama</i> possessed
a human and entered too!

184
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,230
It was no longer the kind of tournament
that any ordinary person could enter!

185
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,570
So then, in the final match,
Goku and Piccolo put on a battle,

186
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,740
with the fate of this world in the balance!

187
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,120
In the end, it was Goku who won,

188
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,250
and became the strongest man on Earth!

189
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,210
However, the fighting ring was lost,

190
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:38,760
and the Tenkaichi Tournament
has not been held since then.

191
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,650
And that was... let's see, how many years ago now?

192
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,980
Huh, Kuririn?

193
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,780
Ah, is that so?

194
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,700
That must have been something terrible.

195
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,170
Even so, why would Cell do something like this?

196
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,300
Why, indeed? Even by winning
the Tenkaichi Tournament,

197
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,130
he can't rule the world.

198
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,760
Cell said he didn't have any
interest in ruling the world.

199
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,510
The purpose of the tournament
was to confirm his own strength,

200
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:30,310
as well as to plunge the
whole world into terror, he said.

201
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:35,320
And besides, it would serve as exercise
to draw out his strength even more.

202
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,150
Damn. He's sure gotten full of himself!

203
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,780
All right, then! In that case, we'll enter too,

204
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,780
and put his nose out of joint!

205
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,870
Yeah!

206
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,330
You'd better give up such pointlessness.

207
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,910
Small fry such as yourselves
will serve no purpose at all.

208
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,670
Well, in any case, now we can relax.

209
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,630
Why does Chichi-<i>san</i> say we can relax?

210
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,630
How should I know?!

211
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,510
Don't you get it?

212
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,300
If he's goin' as far as holdin'
a Tenkaichi Tournament,

213
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,550
then Cell is goin' to obey the rules!

214
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,680
Which means that if he
kills you, it'll mean him losin'!

215
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,520
We'll get through this
without anyone dyin', right?

216
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,020
–That's right!
–In that case, maybe I'll enter as well!

217
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,570
Maybe I'll enter as well.

218
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,400
Don't tell me you're still
clinging to your former glory!

219
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,160
An old guy like you would–yow!

220
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,750
However, with a rule like that, the
Earth will be saved from this crisis, won't it?

221
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,500
Piccolo-<i>san</i> is around and all, and pretty soon,

222
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,170
Goku-<i>san</i> and Gohan-<i>san</i> will be
coming out of the Room of Spirit and Time...

223
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,170
Yeah!

224
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,710
That's right, huh?

225
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,550
Just a second!

226
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,850
Even supposin' we can't stop
Goku-<i>sa</i> from wantin' to enter,

227
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,220
how come you have to have
Gohan-<i>chan</i> enterin' in too?!

228
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,100
But, Chichi-<i>san</i>, as you just said,

229
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,060
there's the rule that says you
can't kill, so there's no danger...

230
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,020
Whether there's any danger or not,

231
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:02,360
I've got no mind to allow Gohan-<i>chan</i>
to be participatin' in any tournament!

232
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,200
B-But...

233
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,200
The Earth has already been saved from its crisis.

234
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,620
Cell is settin' up his Tenkaichi Tournament

235
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,750
so that only those who want to fight have to!

236
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,040
T-That may be so, but...

237
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,380
That's why I'm not allowin'
Gohan-<i>chan</i> to fight any more!

238
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,720
When Gohan was born, Goku-<i>sa</i> agreed to that!

239
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,510
Now then, it's time for your milk!

240
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,150
Goku-<i>sa</i>, I'm going to make
this boy into a great scholar!

241
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,070
A scholar?!

242
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,240
That's right.

243
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,490
The world's at peace now.

244
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:52,490
If he were to become a martial artist,
he'd be servin' no purpose at all.

245
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,450
I-I suppose not...

246
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,750
It's true! I can't let my guard
down to any one of you here!

247
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,260
You'd all inspire Gohan to
be one of your delinquent pals!

248
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,090
–Delinquent, she says?
–How awful!

249
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,680
A-Am I a delinquent too?

250
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:29,160
Now then, as for the tournament grounds...

251
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,740
Well, this area will do, I suppose.

252
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,510
How about I make the ring a little
larger than the Tenkaichi Tournament ring?

253
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,200
Next...

254
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:38,310
As I thought, the stone here
appears to be of fine quality.

255
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,760
Fine. It is a bit plain, but
I'll think of something later.

256
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,420
Now then, how about I head
over to the television station?

257
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,760
<i>Cell, and his unusual way of thinking–</i>

258
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:24,150
<i>will the devilish Cell indeed obey</i>
<i>the rules of the Tenkaichi Tournament?</i>

259
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,230
<i>There is a sense of hell about</i>
<i>this ultra-Tenkaichi Tournament,</i>

260
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,940
<i>as it awaits its warriors.</i>

261
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,630
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

262
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,470
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

263
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,840
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

264
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,350
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

265
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,860
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

266

267

268
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:22,120

269
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:29,630
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

270
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,720
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

271
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,510
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

272
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,550
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

273
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:45,230
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

274
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,400
<i>So sorry.</i>

275
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,570
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

276
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,570
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

277
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,210
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

278
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,920
<i>Trunks, are you sure Cell said</i>
<i>he would give more details on TV?</i>

279
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,930
<i>People of the world, I have wonderful news.</i>
