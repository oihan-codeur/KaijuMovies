22

23
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,090
Since I've saved the Earth and stuff,
they're going to treat me special.

24
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,010
Ordinary folks, and bad guys
like Cell become just spirits,

but they're going to let me keep my body.

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,350
There's also fighting experts
from the past in the Next World here,

27
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,560
and it sounds like it's going to be lots of fun.

28
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,770
Maybe it ain't fair to Chichi and Gohan,

29
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,400
but you don't need to bring me back to life.

30
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,410
There you have it. Bye, now.

31
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,320

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,490
Speak thy second wish.
I shall grant thee any wish.

36
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,500
What should we do?
Does anyone have anything?

37
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:58,210
If we don't decide soon,
Shen Long is going to disappear.

38
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,800
Have ye no wish?

39
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,930
Th-The girl I'm seeing now wants
this necklace that's kind of expensive.

40
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,310
I suppose that's out?

41
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,850
Just kidding!

42
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,900
Well, what will ye do?

43
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,150
Art thou finished?

44
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,610
S-Shen Long,

45
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,450
could you return the
Artificial Humans No. 17 and No. 18

46
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,660
back to the original humans they used to be?

47
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,380
That I cannot do.

48
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:53,510
The two Artificial Humans'
power greatly exceeds my own.

49
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,520
I cannot return them to the
original humans they were.

50
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,430
Th-That fool!

51
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,020
H-He can't do it, huh?

52
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,570
Kuririn, why No. 17, too?
After all, he's dead, isn't he?

53
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,410
No, the first wish was to bring all people

54
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,000
who had been killed by Cell back to life.

55
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,170
It wouldn't be any wonder that
No. 17 had come back to life, too.

56
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,170
Is that so? But still...

57
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,170
Well, can you at least
remove the explosive devices

58
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,590
that the two of them have
fitted inside their bodies?

59
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,220
K-Kuririn...

60
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,020
That would be possible.

61
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,190
All right!

62
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,770
Kuririn-<i>san...</i>

63
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:53,150
I have removed the explosive devices.

64
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,740
And so, farewell.

65
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,030
Kuririn-<i>san</i>, why would you
wish for something like that?

66
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,280
A-After all, you feel sorry for them, don't you?

67
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,160
I mean, having a bomb inside
their body, and everything...

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,290
That was kind of you, Kuririn-<i>san.</i>

69
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,340
Yamucha-<i>san</i>, I'm sorry.

70
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,010
I just helped myself,

71
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:57,930
and so you couldn't give
your girlfriend that necklace.

72
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,810
D-Don't be silly! That was just a joke, you know!

73
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,520
Y-You can't go using Shen Long
for something as trivial as that!

74
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,600
You got me, you got me!

75
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,610
It was just a joke!

76
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,230
<i>Thanks, Yamucha-san.</i>

77
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,620
W-Why that...

78
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:25,910
Be that as it may, Kuririn, why
did you remove No. 17's bomb, too?

79
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:33,010
It's true, I was fond of No. 18,

80
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,550
but No. 18 is better matched with No. 17, right?

81
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,550
S-So I...

82
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,930
There's no helping you, huh?

83
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Th-This sounds like that
"love" business. I don't get it.

84
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,190
N-No. 18?!

85
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,530
You idiot! No. 17 is my twin brother!

86
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,360
Twin brother?

87
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,870
Kuririn, you've got it made! He's her brother!

88
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:05,040
She can't marry her brother! You've got it!

89
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,580
But don't go getting any ideas!

90
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,210
I'm not grateful or anything
about that bomb business!

91
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,790
Got that, baldy?!

92
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,890
See you later.

93
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,280
Oh? Hey, Kuririn!

94
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,780
If she's saying "See you again,"

95
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,200
that means there's a little hope, doesn't it?

96
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,620
R-Really?!

97
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,660
C-Calm down, Kuririn!

98
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,920
I've got the most experience
in love out of any of us, after all.

99
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,590
<i>Th-There is some hope...!</i>

100
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:03,760
Then again, Kuririn, she may be a monster,

101
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,970
but just because she has a cute face,
you shouldn't get your hopes up.

102
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:09,640
The competitive rate is pretty high, after all.

103
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,860
I don't get this one bit.

104
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:20,530
Piccolo, I suppose love would
be a bit too much for you, huh?

105
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,240
I guess I can only be halfway happy.

106
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,540
I am going to miss having Goku around.

107
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,370
Yeah...

108
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm heading home.

109
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,800
Chaozu is probably worried about me, and all.

110
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,590
You're going home already?

111
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,800
I doubt I'll ever see the rest of you again.

112
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,930
Everyone, take care of yourselves.

113
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,930
You too.

114
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,020
Goodbye. Give Chaozu-<i>san</i> my best.

115
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,360
Yeah. Gohan, there's no
way I'll ever forget Son Goku.

116
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,030
Take good care of your mother.

117
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,570
Right!

118
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,700
Trunks, with your power the way it is now,

119
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,660
you should be able to easily defeat
the Artificial Humans in the future.

120
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,960
Good luck!

121
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,880
Right. Thank you for everything you've done.

122
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,330
Bye, now.

123
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,550
–Goodbye!
–See you later!

124
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,010
Well, I guess we should go home, too.

125
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,560
Trunks-<i>san</i>, when are you leaving for the future?

126
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,520
I'm thinking of getting a good night's
sleep tonight, and leaving tomorrow.

127
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,570
All right, we'll come see you off tomorrow.

128
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,690
Okay.

129
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,530
Piccolo-<i>san</i>, are you going to live here?

130
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:45,530
Yeah, that's my plan.

131
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:48,530
Would it be okay if I came
to visit once in a while?

132
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,740
You bet.

133
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,830
Everyone, thank you for all that you've done.

134
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,420
Okay, see you later, Dende.

135
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,340
Be sure you come visit, okay?

136
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,380
See you later, Popo-<i>san.</i>

137
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,640
All right! Let's take off for a new tomorrow!

138
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,570
Goodbye!

139
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,330
Well then, I'll be going to the
Capsule Corporation tomorrow, okay?

140
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,500
See you later!

141
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:00,150
W-Where's Dad?

142
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,650
Ah, when you got killed,
he became extremely angry.

143
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,610
Without any concern for
himself, he went after Cell.

144
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:11,360
I-Is that right?

145
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,530
My father did?

146
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,180
Mother...

147
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,850
Goku-<i>sa</i> died, did he?

148
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:41,390
Turnin' down bein' brought back
to life–that's just like Goku-<i>sa</i>, too.

149
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,400
Mother, don't cry.

150
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,950
I'm always able to feel Father.
Father is alive, after all.

151
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,620
It's true. Gohan's right.

152
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:58,500
Chichi, Goku-<i>sa</i> decided this for himself.

153
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,540
Let him do as he wants.

154
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,020
Take care, okay?

155
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,690
Right.

156
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,580
Goodbye!

157
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,000
Be careful!

158
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,630
Goodbye!

159
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,920
Take care!

160
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,470
See you later!

161
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,270
Father...!

162
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,070
One month after the end of the Cell Games,

163
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:15,030
peaceful days had once
again arrived on the Earth.

164
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,950
Gohan-<i>chan</i>, I have a snack for you!

165
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,620
He must have gone out with Pa.

166
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,330
He went out the window
again. What am I goin' to do with him?

167
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,140
His poor manners are just like Goku-<i>sa</i>'s.

168
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,140
I'll have to give him a good
scoldin' when he gets home.

169
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,610
It's nice takin' a walk on
a nice day like this, huh?

170
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,950
But don't tell Chichi I said so.

171
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,360
You've got it.

172
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,880
The peace really has returned, huh?

173
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,600
Well, how about we find a
present for Chichi and head home?

174
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,180
All right!

175
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,600
H-Hey!

176
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,020
Where are you goin'?!

177
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,600
Someplace I used to play with Father often!

178
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,610
W-Where is that?!

179
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,070
Grandpa, hurry!

180
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,360
It has to be here.

181
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,880
Grandpa! I caught one!

182
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,590
You're here, all right!

183
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:04,390
Gohan, you sure are Goku-<i>sa</i>'s son.

184
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,730
You're just like Goku-<i>sa</i> in that regard!

185
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Gohan! Behind you!

186
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,240
If you want some of this,

187
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,690
just hold on, I'll share it with you.

188
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,030
That's bad manners!

189
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,210
Don't you understand
when I say you can't do that?

190
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,600
That's what you get for having bad manners.

191
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,100
That's my grandson for you.

192
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,480
I guess he didn't figure on Gohan
being the strongest guy on Earth!

193
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,730
He's walking! He's walking!
Trunks-<i>chan</i> is walking!

194
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,030
One-two, one-two...

195
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:07,200
Hang in there! Hang in there, Trunks!

196
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,950
You're doing so good at walking!

197
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:14,250
Oh, Trunks! Are you okay?

198
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,970
His sense of pride is just like his father's.

199
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,430
Okay, okay, Trunks! Now, stand up by yourself!

200
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,850
Way to go, Trunks!

201
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,990
We now bring you this special program!

202
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,160
We present to you this feature,

203
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,160
detailing everything there
is to know about Mister Satan,

204
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,910
the ultra-gifted combat sportsman,
and strongest man on Earth,

205
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,370
who has saved the world and all of mankind!

206
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,710
You're the best, Satan!

207
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,180
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

208
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,350
Tonight, for the first time on TV,

209
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,810
we bring you everything there is to know...

210
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,180
...about the ultra-gifted combat sportsman,

211
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,600
and strongest man on Earth, Mister Satan.

212
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,190
And now, the man who saved
us from the terrible Cell Games,

213
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,230
here is Mister Satan!

214
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,040
What do you mean, strongest man on Earth?

215
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,210
He's the strongest one when it
comes to being a fraud, maybe.

216
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,380
Oh, my! It looks like Mister Satan

217
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,010
is about to show us his
trademark roofing-tile breaking!

218
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,380
W-What's this?!

219
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,010
Tonight, there are 20 tiles, piled up high!

220
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,760
This is incredible!

221
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,230
Mister Satan, as I recall, before the Cell Games,

222
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,190
you faced the challenge of 15 tiles,

223
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,570
and unfortunately left the last
one of them unbroken, didn't you?

224
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,410
I'm not the same person that I was then.

225
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,030
Since then, I've been secretly
undergoing special training.

226
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,910
Incredible! That's our hero, Mister Satan!

227
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,290
He has continued his
conditioning without anyone knowing!

228
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,290
Let me borrow this a second.

229
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,260
You good kids watching this on TV,

230
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,590
don't you dare try doing this yourselves.

231
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,300
Promise me.

232
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,600
That's just what you would expect from
the world's strongest man, Mister Satan!

233
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,600
What marvelous care he exhibits!
He's not just man of strength!

234
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,630
Once again, a single tile remains!

235
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,930
But amazingly, amazingly,
he has cut his way through 19 tiles!

236
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,350
What a fearsome destructive force!

237
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,490
<i>I'm glad I set my video to record while</i>
<i>I'm out, because that was a showstopper!</i>

238
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,490
<i>Although, that still hurt quite a bit.</i>

239
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:36,200
He is indeed every bit
the man that defeated Cell!

240
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,850
Kaio-<i>sama</i>, Mister Satan is quite the actor, huh?

241
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,980
There's always a man
like that around someplace.

242
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,520
Oh, well. It doesn't affect me.

243
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,940
That's right. By the way, Goku...

244
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,530
What?

245
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:12,950
It's about time we started
building us another house.

246
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,280
You're right.

247
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,370
But Kaio-<i>sama</i>, where do you find
a carpenter here in the Next World?

248
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,250
There's one right here.

249
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,210
Bubbles is going to build it?

250
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,170
You, Kaio-<i>sama</i>?

251
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,350
You and I are going to build it together!

252
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,520
Oh, so that's it, huh?

253
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,190
Then again, Kaio-<i>sama,</i>

254
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:48,190
I may be good at breaking things,
but I ain't very good at making stuff.

255
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,190
I'm not expecting much from you.

256
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,210
Here is good. We can build here.

257
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,420
Here, huh?

258
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,210
Okay then, why don't we get started?

259
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,770
<i>Elsewhere, around that same time,</i>

260
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:27,980
<i>Trunks in his time machine was</i>
<i>about to arrive in the world of the future.</i>

261

<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

262
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:54,550
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

263
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,930
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

264
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,430
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

265
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:11,940
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

266
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,030
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

267

268

<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

269
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,670
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

270
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,800
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

271
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,590
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

272
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,640
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

273
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,310
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

274
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,480
<i>So sorry.</i>

275
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,610
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

276

<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

277
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,260
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

278
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,090
<i>In the future that Trunks returned to,</i>

279
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,510

<i>No. 18 are still running amuck.</i>

<i>Not to mention Cell.</i>
