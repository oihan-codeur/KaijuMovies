<i>And makes one of its volcanoes explode!</i>

5
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:43,355
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

00:00:43,395 --> 00:00:52,225
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>

15
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,045
<i>Sparking!</i>

16
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,725
<i>Burning with vengeance against Son Goku,</i>

17
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:59,155
<i>Freeza and his father,</i>

18
00:01:59,195 --> 00:02:03,395
<i>However, a mysterious</i>
<i>young man stood in their way.</i>

19
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:24,055
Son Goku<i>-san</i> is not the
one and only Super Saiyan...

20
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:26,755
...meaning there is another one, right here.

21
00:02:37,475 --> 00:02:38,735
Burn in hell!

22
00:02:44,015 --> 00:02:45,705
You did it, Freeza.

23
00:02:45,745 --> 00:02:49,745
Looks as though he was
no match for us after all.

24
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:55,755
Freeza!

25
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,425
You expect such a low-level attack to...?

26
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:12,165
<i>"Heya!! It's Been a While...</i>
<i>Son Goku Returns."</i>

27
00:03:33,495 --> 00:03:35,485
Kuririn<i>-san</i>, over there!

28
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:22,935
There's no mistaking it,
that was Freeza just now!

29
00:04:22,975 --> 00:04:26,705
It took him only a
moment to take Freeza apart!

30
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:29,375
What are you guys using to see with?

31
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:32,375
I'm surprised you could make that out at all!

32
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:36,685
Anyhow, Son<i>-kun</i> must
have really gotten stronger.

33
00:04:36,725 --> 00:04:40,055
He only needed a second
to take care of Freeza, right?

34
00:04:41,725 --> 00:04:44,695
I guess he saved Earth yet again!

35
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:46,895
That guy isn't Goku.

36
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:51,065
But he does appear to be a Super Saiyan.

37
00:04:56,415 --> 00:04:58,035
Piccolo<i>-san</i>!

38
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,275
I'm going too!

39
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,405
Me too!

40
00:05:01,415 --> 00:05:02,915
Yeah, I'm going too!

41
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:04,415
Hold on!

42
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:07,915
Don't you leave me behind in a place like this!

43
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:09,755
This feels great!

44
00:05:34,915 --> 00:05:37,375
Not bad, are you?

45
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:40,885
That was wonderful, Super Saiyan.

46
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:45,115
Even greater than I had imagined.

47
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:47,425
To think you were able to eliminate...

48
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:49,485
...my son Freeza in that brief instant...

49
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:53,065
How would you like to
take Freeza's place as my son?

50
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:55,065
Having the greatest strength in the universe

51
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,395
makes you especially qualified to join my clan.

52
00:05:57,435 --> 00:06:00,835
You will be able to do as you
please, not only with this Earth,

53
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:04,175
but with many other wonderful worlds.

54
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:07,035
I'm not interested.

55
00:06:08,445 --> 00:06:12,015
I thought it was a good idea.

56
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,015
What a shame.

57
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:16,685
Now then, that sword you have there,

58
00:06:16,725 --> 00:06:19,855
it's a very nice sword indeed.

59
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:22,355
It sliced through the tempered body of Freeza...

60
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:26,365
...without the slightest difficulty, after all.

61
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:29,395
Would you let me see it for a moment?

62
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:32,365
What's the matter?

63
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:36,075
Are you afraid to hand your sword over to me?

64
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:16,375
I see, it has indeed been ground very well.

65
00:07:16,415 --> 00:07:19,375
Leaving that aside, the reason
you were able to defeat Freeza,

66
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:23,385
is because you had this sword.

67
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,915
Don't you think so?

68
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:29,055
What is it you're trying to say?

69
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:35,365
It's a simple matter, really.

70
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:41,395
In short, without this sword,
you cannot win against me!

71
00:08:03,965 --> 00:08:07,765
Apparently, it takes more than just the sword.

72
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,235
W-Wait!

73
00:08:39,165 --> 00:08:43,365
He's a... Super Saiyan all right!

74
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:57,345
Spa-Spare my life!

75
00:08:57,385 --> 00:08:59,415
Please!

76
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,945
Spare my life!

77
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:06,925
I know, I'll give you one of my worlds!

78
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:10,495
No, I'll give you all the worlds in this system!

79
00:09:10,535 --> 00:09:13,395
P-Pl-Please!

80
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:38,385
Who in the world is that guy?!

81
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,325
He not only defeated Freeza,

82
00:09:40,365 --> 00:09:41,685
but that other brute with the huge <i>ki,</i>

83
00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:44,065
without any difficulty at all.

84
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:18,355
I'm now going to go greet Son Goku<i>-san</i>!

85
00:10:18,395 --> 00:10:20,565
Won't you come with me?!

86
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:23,195
What?

87
00:10:23,235 --> 00:10:25,365
How come?

88
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:27,895
How come he knows about Father?

89
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:33,375
This way.

90
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:37,375
Shortly, Son Goku<i>-san</i> is
due to arrive in this area.

91
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:44,385
<i>Just what is the story with this guy?</i>

92
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:50,395
<i>A Super Saiyan? Him? Don't be ridiculous!</i>

93
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:54,425
<i>There's no way there</i>
<i>can be any other Saiyans!</i>

94
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:33,405
Son Goku<i>-san</i> will arrive in three hours.

95
00:11:33,445 --> 00:11:35,275
Please come with me.

96
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:42,845
I'm–I'm going to go with him!

97
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:43,845
Now, hold on!

98
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:46,345
We don't know anything about him.

99
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:48,345
I'm going too.

100
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:52,855
He defeated Freeza and his men,
and knows about Son Goku.

101
00:11:52,895 --> 00:11:55,355
I can't imagine he's all that bad.

102
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:57,355
Besides that, I'm also curious.

103
00:11:57,395 --> 00:12:00,425
I wonder if he's really planning
on greeting Son Goku, like he says.

104
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:03,935
How do you think he knows? It's strange, huh?

105
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:08,235
I guess I'll go, and discover
who this guy really is!

106
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:13,305
Hey, wait a minute!

107
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:57,715
Point five-seven-three mark
one-eight-two-two-zero.

108
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,595
Well, I guess this is it.

109
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:37,555
Be careful, everyone!
He's produced a strange object!

110
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:43,865
There's still some time
before Son Goku<i>-san</i> arrives.

111
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:46,635
There's plenty here to drink.
If you like, be my guest.

112
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,875
I'll take one.

113
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,375
Me too!

114
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:55,905
Hey, Gohan!

115
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:01,785
I'll help myself, thank you. Hmm, which one?

116
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,915
I don't remember us
having this in our product line.

117
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:06,325
I'll take this one.

118
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,425
Wow, delicious!

119
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:12,425
Ah, you're right!

120
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:13,935
Maybe I'll have one too.

121
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:20,495
–Yum!
–Yeah!

122
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:26,505
Have we met somewhere?

123
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:28,505
Uh, no, not exactly.

124
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:31,345
How is it you know about Father?

125
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:35,845
I've only heard stories
about him. We've never met.

126
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:40,185
Well then, how do you know that
Goku will land here in three hours?

127
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:41,625
That, uh...

128
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:44,355
Forgive me, I cannot say.

129
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:46,865
What do you mean you can't say?

130
00:14:46,905 --> 00:14:49,025
Who exactly are you?

131
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:51,365
How did you come to have such power?

132
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:56,375
Forgive me. That as well...

133
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:03,945
Um, when you defeated Freeza,
you were a Super Saiyan, right?

134
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:05,445
Yes, that's right.

135
00:15:05,485 --> 00:15:07,215
Cut the crap!

136
00:15:07,255 --> 00:15:11,785
Counting me and Kakarrot–or
Son Goku as he's known here on Earth–

137
00:15:11,825 --> 00:15:15,525
and that earthling half-breed kid there,

138
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:18,195
there aren't any Saiyans left but us three!

139
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:21,395
Therefore, there's no
way you could be a Saiyan!

140
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:27,805
But the fact remains, he really
did become a Super Saiyan,

141
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,875
and defeated Freeza.

142
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:34,245
On top of that, all Saiyans are black-haired.

143
00:15:37,415 --> 00:15:38,515
Huh?

144
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:42,385
Say, isn't that the trademark of
my family's Capsule Corporation?

145
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:43,215
How come?

146
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:44,885
Are you one of our employees?

147
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:47,555
That's not entirely true.

148
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:49,225
That's a secret too?

149
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:52,855
Then are your name and
age also a private matter?

150
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:57,095
I can't tell you my name,
but I can say I'm 17 years old.

151
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:59,395
Eh... 17.

152
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:01,405
Not being able to tell us
his name is a little strange.

153
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:04,405
Yeah, there's no reason
for him to keep that from us.

154
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:05,915
He's an odd one.

155
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,915
Hey, let's cut out the questions,
we're making him feel awkward.

156
00:16:11,955 --> 00:16:15,545
After all, this kid saved us,
and the Earth as well.

157
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:16,745
Right.

158
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:34,565
Hey, Chichi!

159
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:37,065
Chichi!

160
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,875
Wh-Whatcha got there?

161
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:43,375
I bought it from a TV shop-at-home show.

162
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:46,875
It's the latest in study centers.

163
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,715
This is a Somnioscholastic bed,

164
00:16:48,755 --> 00:16:52,385
which lets you increase
your knowledge while sleepin'.

165
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,225
Besides that, there's this convenient portable

166
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:57,255
encyclopedia tape that comes with it.

167
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,795
Now, both day and night,

168
00:17:00,835 --> 00:17:03,935
I can make sure Gohan keeps studyin'
and studyin' and studyin' some more.

169
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,945
Gohan! Get home soon!

170
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,535
Um, Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

171
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,695
I've been wanting to ask
you for some time now...

172
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:41,365
What?

173
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:42,535
Back a year ago,

174
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:48,375
when Dende and the other
Namekians moved to their new planet,

175
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:52,875
why didn't you go along
with them, Piccolo<i>-san</i>?

176
00:17:52,915 --> 00:17:55,215
There's no great reason.

177
00:17:55,255 --> 00:17:59,185
I just wouldn't be able to put up
with their dull, uninspiring lifestyle.

178
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:03,185
So even now, you're passing
each day with your harsh training?

179
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:05,795
You might say that.

180
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,895
You know, Vegeta's also gone all day long.

181
00:18:08,935 --> 00:18:11,395
I'm sure he's off somewhere training hard.

182
00:18:11,435 --> 00:18:16,165
Yeah. I guess even now he's
thinking of defeating Goku.

183
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:19,135
That guy bears an incredibly high level of pride,

184
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:21,675
since he was the prince of all Saiyans, I hear.

185
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:25,375
Say, don't you think there's a resemblance?

186
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:26,375
What do you mean?

187
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:29,045
Between that unusual boy and Vegeta.

188
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,255
Look, there's something about them.

189
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:34,985
I don't know, maybe there is
something similar about them.

190
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:37,925
But I think their dispositions
are completely different.

191
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:42,925
Why have you been staring
at me so for the last while?

192
00:18:42,965 --> 00:18:45,865
If you really are a Saiyan yourself,

193
00:18:45,905 --> 00:18:48,035
I shouldn't be such a rare sight.

194
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:50,205
I'm sorry.

195
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:52,405
Bothersome punk.

196
00:18:53,915 --> 00:18:55,205
I suppose he...

197
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:59,915
...might be someone Son Goku
knew on some planet out in space.

198
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:01,915
That's not unthinkable, is it?

199
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:05,755
But he seems to be right
at home here on Earth.

200
00:19:05,795 --> 00:19:09,555
Well, like he said, if Son Goku
really does show up here,

201
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,425
we should be able to
unravel some of this mystery.

202
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:15,595
I wonder if Goku really is coming.

203
00:20:06,215 --> 00:20:08,055
S-Sorry!

204
00:20:11,455 --> 00:20:13,355
Three hours have passed.

205
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:16,325
Son Goku<i>-san</i> should be landing any moment.

206
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,355
Really?

207
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:25,865
It's true!

208
00:20:25,905 --> 00:20:28,365
I feel it! I can feel his <i>ki</i>!

209
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:29,365
He's coming!

210
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:32,205
There's something coming, that's for sure!

211
00:20:32,245 --> 00:20:37,175
Then, you mean what this boy said,
about the time and location, was all accurate?

212
00:20:37,215 --> 00:20:39,515
It's Father! It's Father's <i>ki</i>!

213
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:51,765
He's here!

214
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:11,415
Over there!

215
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:13,915
Wait! Wait for me!

216
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:19,555
Hold on!

217
00:21:23,195 --> 00:21:24,785
Down there!

218
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:58,055
Huh?

219
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,295
Welcome home, Father!

220
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:05,935
Goku!

221
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,945
You really are too much!

222
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,875
How come all you guys are here?

223
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:21,245
<i>Just as the young man said,</i>
<i>Son Goku has returned home.</i>

224
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:26,245
<i>However, the mystery surrounding</i>
<i>him has just grown more complex.</i>

225
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:48,105
<i>Here it comes a-fighting,</i>
<i>an apple-colored monster,</i>

226
00:22:48,145 --> 00:22:53,945
<i>Here it comes a-flying,</i>
<i>a nut-scented alien,</i>

227
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:56,315
<i>They meet and the heart beats faster.</i>

228
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:04,825
<i>Sparkle, sparkle, the galaxy's a popcorn shower.</i>

229
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:11,335
<i>Yesterday goes bye, bye, bye, (Gohan),</i>

230
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:15,435
<i>Mystery, (far as the eye can see),</i>

231
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:18,905
<i>Gather up your energy, (substitutes are okay),</i>

232
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:21,535
<i>Come over here, lai, lai, lai.</i>

233
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:29,085
<i>Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!</i>

234
00:23:31,325 --> 00:23:33,185
<i>A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,</i>

235
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:34,985
<i>A mountain full of horizons.</i>

236
00:23:35,025 --> 00:23:39,025
<i>They meet each other, they come apart,</i>
<i>they meet each other, they come apart, Oh, no!</i>

237
00:23:39,065 --> 00:23:44,695
<i>Aah, enough! Even Kami-sama has it rough.</i>

238
00:23:44,735 --> 00:23:46,865
<i>So sorry.</i>

239
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:52,005
<i>Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!</i>

240
00:23:54,745 --> 00:24:00,015
<i>Come on out, full-on ZENKAI power!</i>

241
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:13,495
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

242
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:18,165
<i>Whoa, what a surprise!</i>
<i>Imagine, you being Vegeta's child!</i>

243
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:21,935
<i>My name is Trunks. I came</i>
<i>from twenty years in the future.</i>

244
00:24:21,975 --> 00:24:25,935
<i>In three years, a terrifying</i>
<i>enemy will appear. I came to tell you.</i>

245
00:24:25,975 --> 00:24:28,045
<i>Next time on Dragon Ball Z,</i>

246
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:32,175
<i>"My Dad is Vegeta...</i>
<i>Admissions of the Mysterious Youth."</i>

247
00:24:32,215 --> 00:24:35,955
<i>I get it. So that's why</i>
<i>he can turn Super Saiyan.</i>

248
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:37,685
"Next time"
"My Dad is Vegeta...
Admissions of the Mysterious Youth"
