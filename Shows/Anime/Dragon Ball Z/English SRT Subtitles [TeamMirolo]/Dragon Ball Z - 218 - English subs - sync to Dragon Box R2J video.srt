<i>I will raise my anticipations a hundred-fold,</i>

4

<i>And become our party's leading man.</i>

<i>That which you can lose yourself in</i>

6
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:54,800

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,780
<i>a fight between Videl and Spopovitch,</i>
<i>went contrary to expectations,</i>

25
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,790
<i>as Videl nearly has her life taken from her</i>

26

<i>before Spopovitch's overwhelming power.</i>

27

Why you... You're going to pay now.

28
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,630
You damned bastard!

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,890
The goofing around ends now, Spopovitch!

30
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,190
I don't believe this is
what we came here to do.

31
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,660
R-Ringout! Contestant Spopovitch wins.

32
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,460
<i>What exactly is it that Yamu</i>
<i>and Spopovitch came to do?</i>

33

Still?

36
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,210
Father's been awfully long.

37
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,680
Yeah, with his Instantaneous Movement,
he should have been right back.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,300
It might be that Karin Tower
didn't have any senzu.

39
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,970
Oh, no, Kuririn-<i>san</i>!

40
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,850
I'm going to go see how
Videl-<i>san</i> is doing again.

41
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:50,190
If Father comes back, that's where I'll be.

42
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,350
You know, Gohan...

43
00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:00,780
I hate to say, but this looks like more to me
than simply worrying over a friend, you devil.

44
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,210
Videl! Videl!

45
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,210
Hey, are you sure she's okay?

46
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,670
She's all right. It will take some
time, but there's no mortal danger.

47
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,840
If anything happens to Videl,
someone's going to answer to me!

48
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,680
Mister Satan! Mister Satan!

49
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,220
This is Nathie, the Reporter.

50
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,850
Forgive me for intruding
during your misfortune,

51
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,690
but what is the prognosis for Videl-<i>san</i>?

52
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,850
Please excuse us!

53
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,580
H-How is Videl-<i>san</i>?

54
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,420
Videl is the daughter of the
World Champion Mister Satan!

55
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,750
Her method of training is not like that of others.

56
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,750
There's no cause for concern, so get lost.

57
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,210
I won't be giving any more autographs today.

58
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,220
Er, do you have any words
for Contestant Spopovitch?

59
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,430
I, Mister Satan, will avenge my daughter!

60
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,600
Tell Spopovitch to get ready for me!

61
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,610
I'm going to pound him into a quivering pulp!

62
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,610
Please, another moment,
Mister Satan! Any other comments?

63
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,950
There's so many people there.

64
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,820
Getting into the infirmary doesn't look possible.

65
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,620
I'm not going to concede!

66
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:45,380
Videl beaten by Spopovitch?
What's going on? I can't believe it!

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:55,310
Satan! Satan! Satan!

68
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:08,990
Spopovitch-<i>kun</i>, for you to have to
come against me in the first round,

69
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,540
your usual conduct must be pretty poor.

70
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,000
You have to learn more by watching me,

71
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,000
and becoming a better example
of a good boy to everyone!

72
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,250
What?! Don't make me laugh!

73
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,190
Have you had enough yet?

74
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,310
Dammit!

75
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,950
Contestant Mister Satan wins!

76
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,040
Videl, you must have
taken Spopovitch too lightly,

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,540
and just underestimated him, right?

78
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,370
I've told you since long ago that
carelessness is your greatest enemy,

79
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,920
indeed what else could I do?

80
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,340
D-Don't tell me this is because

81
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,170
you've started associating
with that weakling boy!

82
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,010
I absolutely will not allow it!

83
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,550
Gohan-<i>kun</i>!

84
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,220
What?!

85
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,270
I hope Videl's okay.

86
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,740
Lousy Great Saiyaman! Who the hell are you?!

87
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,990
If only my camera hadn't broken back then!

88
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,960
I did it! I may not have seen
clearly with my naked eye,

89
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,590
but my camera has surely
captured his uncovered face for me!

90
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,220
I, Shapner-<i>sama</i>, have uncovered
the Great Saiyaman's true identity!

91
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,100
Damn, this time I'll uncover
his true identity for sure!

92
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,560
Shapner! Shapner!

93
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,940
Do you think Videl is okay?

94
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,490
Sure she's okay.

95
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,820
I'm going to uncover his identity for sure!

96
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,620
It's the Great Saiyaman!

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,500
Shapner, doesn't the Great
Saiyaman resemble somebody?

98
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,510
I'll uncover his true identity!

99
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,970
Is Father still gone?

100
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,100
Yeah. What could he be doing?

101
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,450
He'd be more charming if he
acted like the dead man that he is

102
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,490
and held back on his appetite a bit.

103
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,660
What a remarkable guy!

104
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,830
The food in the Other World
ain't all that yummy is all.

105
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:06,040
Guess that's limited to the Lower Realm. Yum!

106
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,880
Goku, get back quickly! I have
a really bad feeling about all this.

107
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,510
Me too.

108
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,510
There's these guys named Spopovitch and Shin,

109
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,140
and so much seems about to happen!

110
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,520
Looks like it's going to get interesting!

111
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,150
Spopovitch, it may be
these next two. Look sharp!

112
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,070
It's all right.

113
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,530
As long as we have this, we'll know in a flash.

114
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,910
I want to get this settled quickly.

115
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,530
Yeah.

116
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,540
Kibit, I'll be relying heavily on you.

117
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,370
Right.

118
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,190
"1) Kuririn 2) Punta 3) Shin
4) Ma Junior 5) Videl 6) Spopovitch
7) Kibit 8) Great Saiyaman 9) No. 18
10) Mister Satan 11) Goku 12) Vegeta"

119
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,420
Next is finally Gohan, right?

120
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,510
His opponent is a guy
named Kibit or something.

121
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,890
Doesn't matter to me if he's
Kibit or Shibit, My Gohan will win!
[<i>Shibit</i>: dead]

122
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,560
That's true. Gohan-<i>kun</i> will win easily.

123
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,520
He's the prospective victor, after all.

124
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,690
Goku-<i>sa</i> is also a prospective victor!

125
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,900
That prize money'll be comin' to our house!

126
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,900
Gohan! Hang in there!

127
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,570
Chichi-<i>san</i>, Gohan-<i>kun</i>
being the Great Saiyaman

128
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,450
is supposed to be a secret, right?

129
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,950
Oh, no! I completely forgot!

130
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,660
Continuing on, we now hold the fourth match!

131
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,970
Ahem...

132
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,890
Before that, we have an announcement!

133
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,940
This concerns Contestant Videl,
who was here moments ago.

134
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,480
Apparently, although she has
sustained considerable injuries,

135
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,900
there is no danger to her life.

136
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,820
As such, those of you who
are Videl fans, please be at ease!

137
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,830
And now, the fourth match!
Contestants, please enter the ring.

138
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,290
The fourth match is between
Contestant Kibit and Contestant Great...

139
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,290
Er, pardon me...

140
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,500
Can I ask you to wait a little while longer?

141
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,840
It doesn't matter if it's just a moment or two,

142
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,340
but there's a miraculous
medicine that can heal Videl-<i>san.</i>

143
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,470
My Father should be
bringing it back with him now.

144
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,310
Ah, is that so? V-Very well,
if it'll only be a moment.

145
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,310
I beg your pardon.

146
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,680
We're sorry for the delay,
but please wait one moment.

147
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,360
<i>Father, please hurry!</i>

148
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,950
Father, were there any senzu?!

149
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,950
Yeah. Lately there ain't been any made, I guess,

150
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,740
but there were three of them there.

151
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,790
Thank goodness!

152
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,620
Here, feed one to that girl.

153
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,290
Thanks!

154
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,880
Excuse me, please wait just
a moment. I'll be right back!

155
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,440
<i>This Kibit guy ain't your average type either.</i>

156
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,320
<i>We don't know how deep</i>
<i>the bottom is on that Shin guy.</i>

157
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,660
<i>Piccolo said our dimension</i>
<i>was too different, though.</i>

158
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,950
<i>Hmph, whoever these guys</i>
<i>may be, it doesn't matter to me.</i>

159
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,710
<i>How long have I been waiting for this day?</i>

160
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,040
<i>All I need to do is fight with Kakarrot and win!</i>

161
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,800
Hey, Goten, what did
your dad just bring with him?

162
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,800
Gee, I don't know for sure.

163
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,510
Seems to be some kind of
medicine for that Videl lady to take.

164
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,350
That lady sure did get it good.

165
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,810
She does pretty well, though.

166
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,850
I wish they would start this already.

167
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:39,940
Our fight isn't until the seventh match.
I'm getting tired of waiting.

168
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,280
I think I'm the one who's
getting tired down here.

169
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,880
Videl! Videl!

170
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,880
Papa?

171
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,340
Oh, Videl, you're coming to?

172
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,350
Excuse me, please let me through!

173
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,730
Excuse me, I'm coming in!

174
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,350
Videl-<i>san</i>, I brought you something good!

175
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,730
See here! Videl needs her rest, you!
Who said you could come in?

176
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,230
Pardon me, I'm in a hurry.

177
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,940
W-Why you...!

178
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,530
G-Gohan-<i>kun</i>, I...

179
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:35,910
It's okay, it's okay. Can I coax
you into trying to eat this bean?

180
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,920
Sonny, sonny, this won't do!

181
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,750
We can't have you going around
giving the patients strange things!

182
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,920
Are you an idiot?! This is no
time to be giving her candy!

183
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,920
You'll feel better right away.

184
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,380
I said no, and I mean no!

185
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,800
I'll take it.

186
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:59,900
Knowing you, something amazing
is sure to arise out of this, right?

187
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,730
Yep.

188
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,740
V-Videl, don't listen to
what this guy is telling you!

189
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,900
Hey! Doctor, say something!

190
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,320
R-Right! Um...

191
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,540
Now see here!

192
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,300
S-Spit it out, Videl!

193
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:29,840
Okay. Everyone's waiting for you.

194
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,680
Sorry!

195
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,810
Damn, that kid... I'm going to
show him some pain later on...

196
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,530
Videl...

197
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,210
I-I'm healed!

198
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,940
Sorry to keep you waiting! Everything's fine!

199
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,240
Ladies and gentlemen in the
stadium, we apologize for the delay.

200
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,700
And so, let's have them begin!

201
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,700
Contestant Kibit and
Contestant Great Saiyaman!

202
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,070
Haven't we seen the
Great Saiyaman somewhere...?

203
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,070
Huh? Isn't that Son Gohan?

204
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,240
What?! Hey, let me borrow those for a second!

205
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,160
That hairstyle is a perfect match.

206
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,250
It really is Gohan! He's kidding, right?
He's the Great Saiyaman?!

207
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,420
No way, he couldn't be.

208
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,090
Surely he's just borrowing the
name so he can secretly enter in.

209
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,720
Why would it be necessary
for him to enter secretly?

210
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,100
Look, the kid is really
self-conscious, isn't he? That's why!

211
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,100
But can he really perform in hand-to-hand?

212
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,270
Let's root for him! I know it
won't do any good, but still...

213
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,020
Gohan! Good luck!

214
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,070
Fight, Gohan!

215
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,780
The championship may be out of the question,

216
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,940
but win at least one round!

217
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,990
Still, who would have
thought Gohan would've been...

218
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:05,620
<i>I-I've been completely found-out!</i>

219
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:09,420
<i>That's it! The thing I had wrapped</i>
<i>around my head got taken off.</i>

220
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,500
<i>And I worked so hard to disguise myself!</i>

221
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,090
Way to go, Gohan!

222
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,640
You look better without the sunglasses!

223
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,270
N-Now what do I do?

224
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:29,270
It's Gohan! For us to
discover his identity so easily...

225
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,110
Give me back the money for that camera!

226
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,490
Apparently there have been some
issues, but is everything all right?

227
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:38,280
In that case, begin the fourth match!

228
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,910
Sorry...

229
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,290
<i>I-I'm all messed up now.</i>

230
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,630
<i>If they learn my true power,</i>
<i>it'll turn into a big deal,</i>

231
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,550
<i>and it will become harder for</i>
<i>me to go to school and places,</i>

232
00:18:55,590 --> 00:19:00,340
<i>like Bulma-san said.</i>
<i>That's why I had the disguise...</i>

233
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,890
<i>He doesn't seem to be</i>
<i>the kind of opponent I can</i>

234
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,350
<i>get to let me win with</i>
<i>the right kind of trickery...</i>

235
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,060
Turn yourself into this
Super Saiyan business!

236
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,190
I want to test you,

237
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,650
to see if you will be of help
to us if the situation arises!

238
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,200
Huh? H-How do you know about Super Saiyans?

239
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,200
A-And what do you mean, be of help to you?

240
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,200
You will know the answer
to that in any case shortly.

241
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,500
First, I must see the abilities of a Super Saiyan.

242
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,590
So, it begins...

243
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,050
Y-You've got to be kidding me!

244
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,130
Become a Super Saiyan in
front of all these people?!

245
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,550
What is it? What are they talking about?

246
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,230
He told him to become a Super Saiyan.

247
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,200
How about it, those two?

248
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,580
No, it's not them. Their energy is too low.

249
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,120
Gohan!

250
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,960
Piccolo-<i>san...</i>

251
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,920
What, Piccolo? Is something up?

252
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,630
I don't know what exactly, but...

253
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,060
You must allow us to make use of
Gohan-<i>san</i>. My humble apologies.

254
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,110
And now, no matter what may happen,

255
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,070
I would ask that you please not move from here.

256
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,610
If you would be so kind...

257
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,240
What?!

258
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,200
What is this about?

259
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,120
Well, turn!

260
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,500
Damn, I-I have no choice.

261
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,960
I guess I'll give up school.

262
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,970
I don't listen to those I know nothing about.

263
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,970
Tell us who you are!

264
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,260
Th-This being is the Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>!

265
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,220
He is the Kami over all Kaio,
including the Grand Kaio!

266
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,980
Ah! I've heard about you,
from Kaio-<i>sama</i>! Kaioshin...

267
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,570
You're Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>?

268
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,150
What are you doing, you idiots?!

269
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,160
How long are you two going
to just gape at each other?

270
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,620
Start the match, already!

271
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,120
You're wasting my time!

272
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,170
Ahem, the match has begun.

273
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,050
You all shut up! Somethin'
awesome is about to happen here!

274
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,260
You just watch, ya morons!

275
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,190
<i>Gohan finally commits to</i>
<i>turning into a Super Saiyan.</i>
