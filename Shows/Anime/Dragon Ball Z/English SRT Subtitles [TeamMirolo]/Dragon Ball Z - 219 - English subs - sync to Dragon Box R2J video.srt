<i>was finally getting underway. However...</i>

25
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,060
Turn yourself into this
Super Saiyan business!

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,480
I want to test you, to see
if you will be of help to us!

<i>Further, Shin, who is the Kaioshin,</i>
<i>said to Goku and the others...</i>

28
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,700
You must allow us to make use of
Gohan-<i>san</i>. My humble apologies.

29
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,950
And now, no matter what may happen,

30
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,370
I would ask that you
please not move from here.

31
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,160
If you would be so kind...

32
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,970
<i>And now, finally, Gohan commits to</i>
<i>turning himself into a Super Saiyan!</i>

33
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,970
<i>What exactly is going on behind the</i>

As you wish, I will become a Super Saiyan.

36
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,340
I'm not sure exactly why, though.

37
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:38,890
When Gohan becomes a Super Saiyan,
then what is going to happen?

38
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,980
Quite probably,

39
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:48,110
I believe Gohan-<i>san</i> will be assaulted by
those two from earlier, Spopovitch and Yamu.

40
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,490
However, as I said a moment ago,

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,990
please do not take any action against this.

42
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,710
Sure we won't take action!
Gohan can easily defeat those two!

43
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm not so sure.

44
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,920
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>, you think
Gohan will be beaten by them?

45
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,510
It is all right.

46
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,140
I do not think they will
take his life from him.

47
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:14,560
It is more likely those two
are only after strong energy.

48
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,720
Energy?

49
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,990
Shall I turn all the way into a
Super Saiyan that has further overcome

50
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,660
the Super Saiyan wall?

51
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,290
What?! "Further overcome
the Super Saiyan wall"?!

52
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,370
Hey, look at this!

53
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,840
Terrific energy! It's him!

54
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,170
It can't be! He's transformed!

55
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,380
Gohan-<i>kun</i> has...
It can't be! It can't be!

56
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,350
W-Who would have thought that
Gohan was the Golden Warrior?!

57
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,390
Th-That is the Golden Warrior, isn't it?

58
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,980
I-Impossible! Him?

59
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,980
How 'bout that?!

60
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,360
Just like I said! Right?!

61
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,900
Somethin' even more incredible's
gonna happen, so watch closely!

62
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,450
As you wished, I have
become a Super Saiyan for you.

63
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,000
Now what do we do? Can I fight this way?

64
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,500
<i>Wh-What incredible power this is!</i>

65
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,510
<i>I can hardly believe he is of the Lower Realm.</i>

66
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,670
Hmph. That lowlife!

67
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,340
When he finished off Cell, he
had a lot more on him than this!

68
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,930
He's gotten soft during this peace,
and has neglected his training!

69
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,520
Even so, he has wonderful
power, greater than I imagined.

70
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,940
As to whether or not
I can contain that power...

71
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,940
Contain it?

72
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,610
Piccolo?

73

"Tenkaichi Tournament"
What's the matter, come at me!

74
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,500
H-Hey, when Mister Satan was fighting Cell,

75
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,170
there were some guys like that
there, huh? A handful of them.

76
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,720
You're right. They were there
all right. He looks the same.

77
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:42,180
All right. Let's take that energy from him!

78
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:45,180
Be sure you hold him tight, Spopovitch!

79
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,480
Yeah!

80
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,480
They're here!

81
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,820
What?! You!

82
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,950
Wh-What are you doing?!

83
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,340
Wh-Why?!

84
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,140
Please trust me.

85
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,770
Why you rotten...!

86
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,770
Let me go, Piccolo!

87
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,860
I told you, take no action!

88
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,190
I'll kill anyone who does
anything funny! Got that?!

89
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,960
Please have patience...

90
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,790
O-Outta my way!

91
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,500
Wh-What are you doin' to my Gohan?!
Goku-<i>sa</i>, what are you lookin' at?!

92
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,710
What are you doing to Gohan-<i>kun</i>?!

93
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,300
Let me go! Gohan-<i>kun</i> will be killed!

94
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,720
Gohan ain't going to die that easily.

95
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,810
Why? Tell me why?!

96
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,730
Well?

97
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,900
Be silent and look on.

98
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,650
Why?

99
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,930
Big Brother's going to get killed!

100
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,850
Why don't our Papas go help him?!

101
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,190
I have to save him!

102
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:21,670
Spopovitch! That's enough!
We've absorbed a full portion of energy!

103
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,080
That was easier than I thought!

104
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,840
Not yet!

105
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,260
Do not do anything yet!

106
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,680
It's okay. Kibit will soon restore
Son Gohan-<i>san</i> back to normal.

107
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,270
What exactly is this all about?

108
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,690
I will now follow after those two
such that they do not notice me.

109
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,820
After them?

110
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,070
If it is all right with you, you
may all please come with me.

111
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,820
You will be of great help.

112
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,330
Just what is going on?

113
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,290
What's happening down there?

114
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,710
G-G-Gohan-<i>chan...</i>

115
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,880
Wh-What should we do, Goku?

116
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:53,890
I'm going with him! Kaioshin-<i>sama</i>
said that Gohan will live, after all.

117
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,890
Plus, I just gotta know what's happening here!

118
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,750
Gohan-<i>kun</i>! Are you okay? Shake it off!

119
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,720
Hurry and get a stretcher ready!

120
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,890
S-Say, isn't that Videl? It is, right?

121
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,760
It couldn't be!

122
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,350
I wonder if I'm just having a bad dream...

123
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,940
Ow!

124
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,360
You're going, Goku? W-Well, maybe I'll go too.

125
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,360
I'm a little uneasy about it, though.

126
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,700
Kuririn, what are you gonna do?

127
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,910
Go on ahead first, I'll come
as soon as I let my wife know.

128
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,740
Right!

129
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,750
Don't jerk me around, Kakarrot!

130
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:01,920
What happened to our battle?!
It comes the match after next!

131
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,710
Vegeta, this ain't the time for that, is it?

132
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,260
Don't you cheat me!

133
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,220
I don't know from this Kaioshin, or whatever.

134
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,890
His business doesn't matter!

135
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,890
All I want is to settle
everything with you, one-on-one!

136
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,890
That's the whole reason I came
to this ridiculous Tournament!

137
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,900
Okay, okay. I know how you must feel.

138
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,940
We'll fight later for sure, even if
it ain't at the Tenkaichi Tournament.

139
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,740
Okay? Is that fine with you, Vegeta?

140
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,900
Damn it all!

141
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,950
You can only be in this
world for one day, right?

142
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,490
So then you'll come with me.
We'll do it over there!

143
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,790
Now that's settled, let's go.

144
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,160
Piccolo!

145
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,670
You can assure me that it's okay
if I leave Gohan in your hands?

146
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,640
It's all right. Once I revive
Son Gohan, I will go as well.

147
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,850
I believe Son Gohan will be going too.

148
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,020
Dammit!

149
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,270
You are really getting on my nerves.

150
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,120
Sorry, but that's the way it is.

151
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm not going. There's no money in it, right?

152
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,170
Yeah. Well, make sure you
don't kill anyone in your matches!

153
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,040
See ya!

154
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,130
If things get nasty, you get out of there!

155
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,380
Right!

156
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,880
Wh-Where is everyone going?

157
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,720
You'll find out when you go too.

158
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,690
Okay, please move aside.
We need to carry him off!

159
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:45,690
Just be quiet and watch.

160
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,150
B-But this man has collapsed!

161
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:53,150
W-We'll leave it to you!

162
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,120
<i>His full power has not returned</i>
<i>even yet! His power knows no end!</i>

163
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,040
<i>You know, I cannot believe</i>
<i>there are those among mankind</i>

164
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,050
<i>under the power of such</i>
<i>great, such pure energy!</i>

165
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,220
<i>It's no wonder they were after it.</i>

166
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,260
What?! What's going on?!
Goten, did your brother just lose?

167
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,060
I hope Big Brother is okay.

168
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,520
Where did our Papas fly off to?

169
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,990
That's enough, Son Gohan.

170
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:44,290
Gohan-<i>kun</i>! You're okay, aren't you?

171
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,170
It's like I have more power than before!

172
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,710
Wh-Who are you?

173
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:58,130
Come with me. I will tell you everything.

174
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,060
Hey, have you seen Videl?

175
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,980
Ah, the young lady is over there.

176
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:15,570
She's with that kid again!

177
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,240
Dammit! I don't care if he did heal
Videl's injuries with that mysterious bean,

178
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,030
I absolutely forbid them to associate!

179
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,260
Say, can I come along with you?

180
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,260
There are lots of things...
I want to know. Please?

181
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,310
No, you'd better not.

182
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,690
There's going to be some danger for sure.

183
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,150
I know that much, more or less.

184
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,150
I won't get in the way,
I just want to come along.

185
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,150
I'm coming, even if you say no.

186
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,030
Videl?!

187
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,830
Can you promise me that
when things get dangerous,

188
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,200
you'll be sure to run away?

189
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,670
Okay. Let's go.

190
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,460
Thanks!

191
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:26,640
She's f-f-f-flying...

192
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,640
V-Videl's flying through the air!

193
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,230
Starting a few moments ago,
everyone has been flying.

194
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,230
V-Videl, I...

195
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,070
...should have grounded you.

196
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:43,740
Wow! That joke sure is an old one!

197
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,740
I got a bad feelin' about this.

198
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,080
Wh-What about the Tenkaichi Tournament?!

199
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,590
With this, the Majin-<i>sama</i> can return to life!

200
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,890
Babidi-<i>sama</i> will be so pleased!

201
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,330
"Tenkaichi Tournament"

202
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,250
What do you suppose happened
to the Tenkaichi Tournament?

203
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,670
The broadcast relay has stopped,

204
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,300
and there's nothing but
Mister Satan's face now!

205
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,900
Hey!

206
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,700
So, you have come after all.

207
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,790
This will be most helpful.

208
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,040
If I cannot borrow your
powers, we will not likely win...

209
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,630
Not win? You mean against those two?

210
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:23,210
No. Those two are merely
being used by an extremely clever

211
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,840
"Madoshi," or a warlock.

212
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,800
A Madoshi?

213
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,010
Yes.

214
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,390
Long ago, around the
time when mankind on Earth

215
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,430
was just starting to walk on two legs...

216
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:38,440
...deep in space, there was
an evil Madoshi named Bibidi.

217
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,990
One day, this Bibidi accidentally
conjured up an extraordinary monster.

218
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:48,030
This incredibly fearsome Majin was named Boo.

219
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,950
Boo? He sounds like a fart...

220
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,160
Majin Boo had no reason or feeling,

221
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,580
and did nothing but perform
destruction and savagery over and over.

222
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,460
He was a monster born only
to raise terror in living things.

223
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,340
In only a few years,

224
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:11,390
he had turned many hundreds
of planets into worlds of death.

225
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:29,990
Something along those
lines sounds like us Saiyans...

226
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,990
No, Vegeta-<i>san.</i>

227
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,790
At the time, there were five Kaioshin.

228
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,540
Each of us were such that we could have
defeated the likes of Freeza in one blow.

229
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,420
Among the Kaioshin, four
of us were killed by Majin Boo.

230
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,890
Incredible!

231
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:54,930
That punk! He can read minds too, can he?

232
00:20:54,970 --> 00:21:00,350
Majin Boo's ferocity was more than
even his creator Bibidi could handle.

233
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,230
In any case, time came
when he needed to rest,

234
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,650
so he temporarily sealed Majin Boo
inside a ball so he could not move.

235
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,580
Bibidi brought the sealed
Majin Boo to this Earth.

236
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,290
The Earth was supposed
to have been his next target.

237
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,000
Th-That's unbelievable!

238
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,500
It was our chance.

239
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:29,010
Kaioshin-<i>sama</i> was able to kill
Bibidi before he could break the seal.

240
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:34,970
However, Majin Boo's
sealed ball was left as it was.

241
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,560
But why? You could have
destroyed it way back then!

242
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,940
It was thought best not to
stimulate it any more than necessary.

243
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,360
Besides, Madoshi Bibidi was
supposed to have been the only one

244
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
who could break the seal.

245
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,400
Supposed to have been?

246
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,570
Quite recently, we
discovered something terrible.

247
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:55,990
Madoshi Bibidi had a child!

248
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,000
He was another Madoshi, who had
the same heart of evil as his father.

249
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,620
The child's name was Babidi.

250
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,880
Madoshi Babidi?

251
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,460
It seems that Babidi is nearly
ready to break Majin Boo's seal.

252
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,390
The identity of those squirming
around behind the scenes

253
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,600
at the Tenkaichi Tournament becomes clear.

254
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:30,150
Kaioshin Shin and the others' goal is to
stop the actions of the Madoshi Babidi.

255
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,990
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

256
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,580
<i>Angel... Angel... Angel...</i>

257
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:56,180
<i>Buried in time and distant memories,</i>

258
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:02,270
<i>That's right, we were angels.</i>

259
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:09,270
<i>From high in the sky we</i>
<i>scattered the seeds of love,</i>

260
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:14,650
<i>We wanted to rid the world of sadness.</i>

261
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,530
<i>Say, look at that blue sky,</i>

262
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:27,580
<i>As you stare into it, doesn't</i>
<i>your courage swell up inside?</i>

263
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,130
<i>Even now?</i>

264
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:36,760
<i>To my friends, we may have lost</i>
<i>the wings from our backs, but still,</i>

265
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,180
<i>There's some mysterious</i>
<i>power that remains with us.</i>

266
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,650
<i>To my friends, let's embrace</i>
<i>the light and dare to dream,</i>

267
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:58,700

<i>(Angel... Angel... Angel...)</i>

268
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,510
<i>Heya! I'm Goku!</i>

269
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:19,180
<i>It sounds like our foe this time</i>
<i>is someone out of this world, huh?</i>

270
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,350
<i>Oh, Babidi has come out of the</i>
<i>spaceship. Ah, and what's worse,</i>

271
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,730
